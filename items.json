The demand, equivalent to about 20,000 bottles being bought every second, is driven by an apparently insatiable desire for bottled water and the spread of a western, urbanised \u201con the go\u201d culture to  and the Asia Pacific region.More than 480bn plastic drinking bottles were sold in 2016 across the world, up from about 300bn a decade ago. If placed end to end, they would extend more than halfway to the sun. By 2021 this will increase to 583.3bn, according to the most up-to-date estimates from Euromonitor International\u2019s global packaging trends report.Most plastic bottles used for soft drinks and water are made from polyethylene terephthalate (Pet), which is highly recyclable. But as their use soars across the globe, efforts to collect and recycle the bottles to keep them from polluting the oceans, are failing to keep up. Fewer than half of the bottles bought in 2016 were collected for recycling and just 7% of those collected were turned into new bottles. Instead most plastic bottles produced end up in landfill or in the ocean. Between 5m and 13m tonnes of plastic leaks into the world\u2019s oceans each year to be ingested by sea birds, fish and other organisms, and by 2050 the ocean will contain more plastic by weight than fish,  by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.Experts warn that some of it is already finding its way into the human food chain.Scientists at Ghent University in Belgium  people who eat seafood ingest up to 11,000 tiny pieces of plastic every year. Last August,  reported plastic was found in a third of UK-caught fish, including cod, haddock, mackerel and shellfish. Last year, , citing increasing concern for human health and food safety \u201cgiven the potential for microplastic pollution in edible tissues of commercial fish\u201d.Dame , the round the world yachtswoman, now campaigns to promote a circular economy in which plastic bottles are reused, refilled and recycled rather than used once and thrown away.\u201cShifting to a real circular economy for plastics is a massive opportunity to close the loop, save billions of dollars, and decouple plastics production from fossil fuel consumption,\u201d she said.Hugo Tagholm, of the marine conservation and campaigning group Surfers Against Sewage, said the figures were devastating. \u201cThe plastic pollution crisis rivals the threat of climate change as it pollutes every natural system and an increasing number of organisms on planet Earth.\u201cCurrent science shows that plastics cannot be usefully assimilated into the food chain. Where they are ingested they carry toxins that work their way on to our dinner plates.\u201d Surfers Against Sewage are campaigning for  to be introduced in the UK as a way of encouraging reuse.Tagholm added: \u201cWhilst the production of throwaway plastics has grown dramatically over the last 20 years, the systems to contain, control, reuse and recycle them just haven\u2019t kept pace.\u201dIn the UK 38.5m plastic bottles are used every day \u2013 only just over half make it to recycling, while more than 16m are put into landfill, burnt or leak into the environment and oceans each day.\u201cPlastic production is set to double in the next 20 years and quadruple by 2050 so the time to act is now,\u201d said Tagholm.There has been growing concern about the impact of plastics pollution in oceans around the world. Last month scientists found .Another study . And earlier this week scientists warned that plastic bottles and other packaging , endangering wildlife from basking sharks to puffins.The majority of plastic bottles used across the globe are for drinking water, , according to Rosemary Downey, head of packaging at Euromonitor and one of the world\u2019s experts in plastic bottle production.China is responsible for most of the increase in demand. The Chinese public\u2019s consumption of bottled water accounted for nearly a quarter of global demand, she said.\u201cIt is a critical country to understand when examining global sales of plastic Pet bottles, and China\u2019s requirement for plastic bottles continues to expand,\u201d said Downey.In 2015, consumers in China purchased 68.4bn bottles of water and in 2016 this increased to 73.8bn bottles, up 5.4bn.\u201cThis increase is being driven by increased urbanisation,\u201d said Downey. \u201cThere is a desire for healthy living and there are ongoing concerns about groundwater contamination and the quality of tap water, which all contribute to the increase in bottle water use,\u201d she said. India and Indonesia are also witnessing strong growth.Plastic bottles are a big part of the huge surge in usage of a material first popularised in the 1940s. Most of the plastic produced since then still exists; the petrochemical-based compound takes hundreds of years to decompose.Major drinks brands produce the greatest numbers of plastic bottles. Coca-Cola produces more than 100bn throwaway plastic bottles every year \u2013 or 3,400 a second, according to analysis carried out by Greenpeace after the company refused to publicly disclose its global plastic usage. The top six drinks companies in the world use a combined average of just 6.6% of recycled Pet in their products, according to Greenpeace. A third have no targets to increase their use of recycled plastic and none are aiming to use 100% across their global production.Plastic drinking bottles could be made out of 100% recycled plastic, known as RPet \u2013 and campaigners are pressing big drinks companies to radically increase the amount of recycled plastic in their bottles. But brands are hostile to using RPet for cosmetic reasons because they want their products in shiny, clear plastic, according to Steve Morgan, of Recoup in the UK.In evidence to a House of Commons committee, the British  Federation (BPF), a plastics trade body, admitted that making bottles out of 100% recycled plastic used 75% less energy than creating virgin plastic bottles. But the BPF said that brands should not be forced to increase the recycled content of bottles. \u201cThe recycled content ... can be up to 100%, however this is a decision made by brands based on a variety of factors,\u201d said Philip Law, director general of the BPF.The industry is also resisting any taxes or charges to reduce demand for single-use plastic bottles \u2013 like the 5p charge on plastic bags that is credited with reducing plastic bag use by 80%. Coca Cola said it was still considering requests from Greenpeace to publish its global plastics usage. A spokeswoman said: \u201cGlobally, we continue to increase the use of recycled plastic in countries where it is feasible and permitted. We continue to increase the use of RPet in markets where it is feasible and approved for regulatory food-grade use \u2013 44 countries of the more than 200 we operate in.\u201d She agreed plastic bottles could be made out of 100 percent recycled plastic but there was nowhere near enough high quality food grade plastic available on the scale that was needed to increase the quantity of rPET to that level. \u201cSo if we are to increase the amount of recycled plastic in our bottles even further then a new approach is needed to create a circular economy for plastic bottles,\u201d she said. Greenpeace said the had to do more to increase the recycled content of their plastic bottles. \u201cDuring Greenpeace\u2019s recent expedition exploring plastic pollution on remote Scottish coastlines, we found plastic bottles nearly everywhere we went,\u201d said Louisa Casson, oceans campaigner for Greenpeace.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that the soft drinks industry needs to reduce its plastic footprint.\u201d"},

But for some dating apps and sites, the free version may actually be all you need, so free dating sites and apps do exist, you just have to know which ones to use.Online dating is hard, y'all \u2014 but so is dating in person. Basically, dating is just the worst, which is why we're always trying to save you time by ranking the  in general, the , the , and, hell, even the  for those who just want to \"date\" from home. Dating sucks...until you find someone you truly vibe with, that is. Then dating is *the best.*SEE ALSO: At some point you've probably considered registering for a dating site \u2014\u00a0that is, until you see the subscription prices and decide that maybe it's cheaper to just sip a beer at a bar. Sorry, , but some of us don't have the funds to spend $40 per month on finding a significant other. We got bills, yo. maybe you want to test the waters of  without investing a lot. The expensive sites do offer free trials, but seven days isn't enough time to find someone. What you need is a free dating site that gives you a full array of options and that isn't a total scam.We did the research for you and have compiled a comprehensive list of the best free dating apps and sites, and will give you the lowdown on what type of person each one is best suited for. (And if you land a hot date out of this, we expect a thank you.)We're just going to spoil it right now: Our top pick for the best free dating app with a desktop version is . Okay, we're totally biased because of their sweet ad campaigns, but this site has it all. OkCupid's matching strategies are based on non-traditional questions and push for lasting connections. Plus, since it's one of the first dating sites ever (it debuted in 2004), its trusted name brings along a robust user base. OkCupid is also geared toward liberals and is extremely inclusive and LGBTQ+ friendly, which is a major bonus in our eyes.Our top pick for the best free dating app without a desktop version is : How could we  choose the love child of an all-in serious dating site and a laid back, millennial swiping app as our favorite? Hinge offers the minimalistic, download-and-go feel that impatient people love, but mixes in pinches of seriousness and a smart matching algorithm to give you a real shot at finding a long lasting relationship. It's really the perfect recipe. Basically, Hinge is what you suggest to someone who constantly complains about the crappy match pool or vulgar messages on Tinder.\u00a0The classic dating sites that you think of where users sit down at a computer and message their boo for hours on end. These are usually aimed toward more serious relationships with extensive questionnaires, intelligent matchmaking, and significantly more features than app-only services.These are newer services, like Hinge and Tinder, that take never-before-seen approaches to online dating. They are aimed toward young people who are glued to their phones. Layouts are much more organized and similar to a social media profile, but have fewer features than sites with desktop versions. On the plus side, this minimalistic setup makes it easier to interact with more people on a daily basis.\nAll products featured here are independently selected by our editors and writers. \nIf you buy something through links on our site, Mashable may earn an affiliate commission.\n"},

In Astoria, the  is a collaboration between Recology and Astoria Visual Arts.Over 170 professional and 30 student artists have participated in these programs.Our AIR Programs are designed to support local artists and art communities. Resident artists are provided with access to materials at our facilities, studio space and a stipend, and exhibitions are held at the end of each residency. After their residencies, artists leave artwork to be kept in Recology\u2019s permanent collection. These pieces are shown in exhibitions that promote the power of reuse.Each AIR Program accepts applications annually from professional artists working in the local community. Artists are selected by advisory boards, and applications are evaluated based on a variety of criteria:The Recology Volunteer Program was established in 2008 to support local organizations that work to make our communities better to live in. Recology employees and community volunteers work together several times each year to beautify and restore community centers, retirement homes, parks, and other public spaces with fresh recycled paint, compost, drought resistant plants, and mulch.In 2013/2014, almost 1,200 employees in California, Oregon and Washington participated in 34 volunteer events, committing over 8,000 hours in gardening, painting, and repairing facilities within communities we serve.The John A. Legnitto Environmental Learning Center (ELC) at Recology San Francisco is where the public goes to learn more about resource recovery. Named after one of our most loved general managers who passed away in 2015, the ELC is utilized for class field trips, tours, and other educational meetings.The ELC houses a classroom, the  program offices, and a gallery featuring work made by past artists.Sign up for a facility tour to learn more about materials processing,\u00a0zero waste efforts in San Francisco, and the Recology Artist in Residence ProgramRecology\u00a0offers public tours on the 3rd Saturday and 4th Wednesday of each month.

{"url": "https://www.zerowaste.com/blog/tips-office-zero-waste/", "title": "TipsforMakingYourOfficeZeroWasteZeroWaste", "body": "Working towards a zero-waste future may be your goal, and while it sounds ambitious, there are small changes you can make to your daily habits to get you well on the way to designing out waste. Here, we\u2019ve compiled five measures anyone can take in their office (or at-home office!) to start, or continue on, their zero-waste path.Skip the coffee shops and single-serve pods and brew your coffee at home. Whether a French press or common coffee pot is used, the left-over coffee grounds can be added to your compost bin,  or even added to houseplant soil to help with aeration. If at-home brewing is not an option, remember your travel mug for coffee shop visits and have them fill it with your favorite cup of joe.Too many times, we\u2019re so busy that we have to grab lunch and eat alone at our desk. Consider hosting a potluck at your office one day a week and include your own reusable dishware and cutlery. Or, if you don\u2019t have an office full of co-workers to round out your lunch menu, bring in last night\u2019s leftovers in your reusable container or do some meal prep so taking your lunch doesn\u2019t feel so overwhelming. Remember to compost any remaining fruit and veggie scraps.Even when most of the components of food packaging are recyclable, there are some parts that might have plastic film, which can\u2019t be recycled at the curb. So even if we do our best to shop with reusable bags and avoid the other plastics typically encountered, the reality is, we\u2019ll probably end up with some of it. Luckily, there are services available for you to collect and drop off plastic films and bags at a nearby grocery store. Find where your nearest  is.Sometimes by force of habit, we throw away materials that can be composted, recycled, or diverted from a landfill simply because a waste bin is nearby. By removing the trash bins near desks, it\u2019ll inspire you to think more about the materials you dispose of, where the waste should go, and hopefully give you a chance to run into a colleague or friend while responsibly disposing of waste. That\u2019s a win-win-win!Americans throw away nearly 40 million tons of food each year, equating to 219 pounds of food waste per person. While food can decompose faster than plastic, it contributes to 7 percent of greenhouse gasses and attracts bugs and rodents when thrown away. There are ways you can avoid having food waste end up in a landfill. If at-home or at-work composting is not an option, many cities offer organic waste pick-up services that may even provide compost back to you for your garden.\u00a0Imagine if an entire office participated in these zero waste initiatives. Not only would you be decreasing your eco-footprint but you would save money, build camaraderie with co-workers, and know you are doing your part to reduce waste and make sure that any that remains ends up in the proper waste stream rather than in landfill.\n"},

Although pet clean-up isn\u2019t on everyone\u2019s brain, a simple act like using compostable pet waste bags shouldn\u2019t be a number two priority \u2014 it\u2019s an easy way to ensure waste decomposes faster and harmful plastics are kept out of landfills, water sources, and even the air we breathe.Choosing compostable pet waste bags helps you on your path to zero waste because\u2026In the US, the dog waste produced every year averages. Unscooped, this poop is a significant contributor to bacteria, such as e. coli and salmonella, in oceans and waterways. Dog waste alone can contribute  and 10 to 50 percent in the air we breathe.Most pet waste that is sent to landfills is encased in petroleum-based polyethylene (PE) bags, which can take up to 1,000 years to decompose. Compostable pet waste bags decompose much faster than PE (polyethylene) plastic bags. However, compostable bags won\u2019t decompose if disposed of inside a non-compostable bag. Dispose of the compostable bag and the waste curbside with other compostable yard waste, bury it in your backyard, or compost it yourself.Properly scoop and dispose of poop in compostable bags rather than plastic bags the next time your dog schedules a business meeting.\n"},

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_waste_dumping", "title": "GardenwastedumpingWikipedia", "body": ", or  is the act of discarding or depositing garden waste somewhere it does not belong.    \nGarden waste is the accumulated plant matter from gardening activities which involve cutting or removing vegetation, i.e. cutting the lawn, weed removal, hedge trimming or pruning consisting of lawn clippings. leaf matter, wood and soil.\nThe composition and volume of garden waste can vary from season to season and location to location. A study in , , found that on average, garden waste generation per person ranged between 122\u00a0kg to 155\u00a0kg per year.\nGarden waste may be used to create  or , which can be used as a soil conditioner, adding valuable nutrients and building . The creation of compost requires a balance between, nitrogen, carbon, moisture and oxygen. Without the ideal balance, plant matter may take a long time to break down, drawing nitrogen from other sources, reducing nitrogen availability to existing vegetation which requires it for growth.\nThe risk of dumping garden waste is that it may contain seeds and plant parts that may grow (), as well as increase fire fuel loads, disrupt visual amenity, accrue economic costs associated with the removal of waste as well as costs associated with the mitigation of associated impacts such as , forest fire.\nThere are strong links between weed invasion of natural areas and the proximity and density of housing. The size and duration of the community have a direct relation to the density of weed infestation. Of the various means in which migration of exotic species from gardens take place, such as vegetative dispersal of runners, wind born and fallen seed, garden waste dumping can play a significant role. The results of one North German study found that of the problematic population of , app. 29% originated from garden waste. Of a population of , 18% was found by Schepker to be generated by garden waste (as cited by Kowarik & von der Lippe, 2008) pg 24\u201325.\nAn Australia government publication suggest that some of the main reasons for the dumping of garden waste can be attributed to lack of care for the environment, convenience, or a reluctance to pay for the correct collection or disposal of the waste. (Environmental Protection Agency [EPA]. 2013). People dump garden waste to avoid disposal fees at  sites or because they do not want to spend the time or effort disposing of or recycling their waste properly. This activity is carried out by people in all parts of the community, from householders to businesses, such as professional landscapers and gardeners.\nThe spread of exotic vegetation can out-compete locally endemic vegetation, altering the composition and structure of an .\nDumping of garden waste in particular facilitates the spread of exotic vegetation into forest remnants via the introduction of seeds and propagules contained within the garden waste. Common selection criteria for home gardeners when choosing plants are often based on ease of propagation, suitability to local environmental conditions and novelty. These specific chosen characteristics increase the chance of plant parts and seeds that are introduced into forested areas becoming a problem.\nThe three major causes of animal habitat degradation are; the disruption or loss of ecosystem functions, the loss of food resources and loss of resident species. Non-native invaders can cause extinctions of vulnerable native species through competition, pest and disease transportation and habitat and ecosystem alteration.\nThe dumping of garden waste in nature reserves surrounding and near urban areas increases the risk of fires. The dumped garden waste will eventually dry out creating fuel adding to already fallen debris fuel load on which a fire can thrive and spread on. Garden waste can spread weeds and these weeds build fuel for fires.  Dumped garden waste can facilitate higher rates of erosion by smothering natural vegetation cover.  With no root systems for stabilisation the top soil is vulnerable to erosion (Ritter, J. 2015), This can add higher  levels of sediments, contributing to the siltation of creeks and waterways.\nIf plant matter gets into waterways it can create reduced oxygen levels through the process of decomposition of green waste such as lawn clippings. This directly upsets the quality of water, affecting fish and aquatic wildlife.\nThis dumping of green waste can also lead to the blocking of drainage systems; directly through the build-up of plant debris, and indirectly through the spread of invasive plant species that colonise wet areas, reducing and or changing the flow of waterways. This change in flow, including path and velocity, can alter hydrological cycles, affecting frequency and intensity of floods.\nGreen and garden waste has a direct impact to the visual aesthetics of land and can often attract further .\nDumping garden waste in  and parks surrounding and near  can effect directly and indirectly the existing  and , as well as human life through the  increased risk of fires.  The dumped garden waste will eventually dry, creating additional  fuel, adding to already fallen debris on which a fire can thrive and spread. Garden waste can spread weeds and these weeds also build fuel for fires. Fires may also spread to the suburban areas where humans can also be impacted by losing their homes from fire, incur injury or death from smoke or burns, and suffer economic loses such as income loss and clean-up costs. Fires can lead to an overall loss of  and biodiversity.\nThe invasion of exotic plant  into remnant native forests is a threat to biodiversity. Some impacts of habitat degradation include; when native animals, insects and birds become vulnerable and put at risk; loss of food source for native wildlife; disruption of native plant-animal relationships ie pollination and seed dispersal and disconnection of plant-host relationships. Highly adaptive plants chosen for their ease of cultivation out compete more specialised species. \nWeed invasion of a forest system can change the processes of plant succession (the system of one species replacing another due to disturbance factors), the composition of the  and the composition and availability of nutrients. The change in forest composition can lead to loss of unique plant species.\nWhen a habitat is destroyed, the plants, animals, and other  that occupied the habitat have a reduced carrying capacity so that populations decline and  becomes a threat. Many endemic organisms have very specific requirements for their survival that can only be found within a certain ecosystem. The term 'hotspot' is used to describe areas featuring exceptional concentrations of endemic species and facing high potential of habitat degradation. The 25 most significant hotspots contain the habitats of 133,149 plant species (44% of all plant species worldwide; table 1) and 9,645 vertebrate species (35% of all vertebrate worldwide; table 2). These endemics are confined to an expanse of 2.1 million square kilometers (1.4% of land surface). Having lost 88% of their primary vegetation, they formerly occupied 17.4 million square kilometers or 11.8% of land surface.\nThe recruitment of alien invasive species may lead to a homogenisation of landscapes. Although increased bio diversity in subregions created by newly  may occur, the displacement of the existing plant species may lead to reduced biodiversity on a global scale.\nWhen population-level properties that indicate superior competitive ability of the invading species are examined, 13\u201324 (42\u201377%) of the species are included, with the majority of species showing traits capable of modifying natural systems at both ecosystem and community/population scales.\nThe dumping of green waste such as lawn clippings can block drainage systems which pollutes water therefore effecting water quality and the health of aquatic plants and animals. Dumped garden waste can add high levels of sediments, reducing the light available for photosynthesis.  Dumping also block waterways and roads, cause flooding and facilitate higher rates of erosion by smothering natural vegetation cover.\nIllegal dumping is carried out by all types of people in all parts of the community, from householders to businesses and other organizations. Addressing these motivations will enable strategies to be developed that deal with the root causes, rather than the results, of illegal dumping.\nSome of the main reasons for this careless disregard for waste can be put down to sheer convenience, lack of care for the environment and also a reluctance to pay for the correct collection or disposal of the waste. The monitoring of illegally dumped garden waste by the community and industries will drive effectual tactics to battle illegal depositing. People dump waste illegally to avoid disposal fees at landfill sites or because they do not want to spend the time or effort disposing of or recycling their waste properly. Alligator weed ( (Mart.) Griseb.) is an introduced weed originating from Sri Lanka and is creating major issues throughout the Australia since its introduction into the country. Alligator weed has the potential to affect aquatic and terrestrial biodiversity severely and to cause considerable social and economic costs, particularly in aquatic situations.\nEducation on the value of biodiversity and the negative effects of weed invasion have been identified as key items in changing current trends. Specific education campaigns on the risks of dumping garden waste could be targeted at high-risk societal groups such as residents of housing in close proximity to reserves as well as members of gardening communities and plant sellers. \nRestricting the selection of garden species in new housing developments adjacent to reserves may reduce the effects of , thereby reducing requirement and associated cost of weed management. Creating habitat for wildlife by planting native plants, making a water source available, provide shelter and places to raise young. Healthy ecosystems are necessary for the survival and health of all organisms, and there are a number of ways to reduce negative impact on the environment. Cultivation of native plant species may benefit not only native plant populations but also native animal populations. For example, Sears & Anderson suggest that native bird species diversity in Australia and North America tend to match the volume and diversity of native vegetation. Crisp also explains the percentage of native insect species in a fauna has been found to be consistent with the percentage of native plant species.\nComposting is a great way to recycle nutrients back into soils. Mulching the garden with leaves and clippings (BMCC, n.d). \nFostering an appreciation of local natural environmental features and plant species may also help mitigate the issue. as well as the restriction of highly invasive plant species through international policy.\nUtilization of green waste bins that are provided by some councils or shires that are emptied via curbside collection (BMCC. n.d). The addition of facilities for waste disposal could also improve the issue (DECC. 2008).  Mitigation may involve governments holding campaigns that show people disposing legally and reporting the consequences for disposing illegally. A way Australian governments are addressing the problem is through the increase of fines in conjunction with better law enforcement.  In Australia, fines can be up to $1,000,000 and can also incur imprisonment. The Protection of the Environment Operations Act imposes penalties for offences including polluting waters with waste, polluting land, illegally dumping waste or using land as an illegal waste facility.\nThe new section of the  (The Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997) now imposes further penalties for offences including polluting waters with waste, polluting land, illegally dumping waste or using land as an illegal waste facility (Parrino, Maysaa, Kaoutarani & Salam, 2014). Communities are encouraged to report illegal dumping. In accordance with NSW Illegal Dumping Strategy 2014\u201316, hefty fines and a maximum jail sentence of 2 years can be handed down to repeat offenders.\n"},

And finally, we  the little bit that\u2019s left with carbon offsets, making Allbirds a completely carbon neutral business. But our goal is bigger\u2014emit no carbon in the first place. We can create a sustainable future, but only if we hold each other accountable.Well, our carbon footprint is the kg CO2e emitted to create our products. That stands for kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. And it means we\u2019re tallying all greenhouse gases and converting them to CO2 when measuring the environmental impact of all our products from now on. So when we say the average footprint of our products is 7.6 kg CO2e (reminder: that means \u201ccarbon dioxide equivalent emissions\u201d\u2014a mouthful, we know), we\u2019re saying we\u2019re keeping tabs on things like methane emissions, too, a greenhouse gas even more potent than carbon dioxide.We start with the  we source, replacing synthetics with natural, renewable materials whenever we can. We keep track of energy used throughout our , too. We also factor in \u2014since our products are machine washable, the energy from the washing machine comes into the equation. Finally, there\u2019s \u2014we don\u2019t have a great solution in place to lay your Allbirds to rest yet, but we\u2019re working on it.We report  separately in our company-wide emissions\u2014you can read more about the nitty gritty The result of those measurements? Our products\u2019 . The total amount of CO2e (remember what that stands for? hint: it\u2019s \u201ccarbon dioxide equivalent emissions\u201d) emitted to create each Allbirds product, before we offset that number to zero. We\u2019re putting our numbers on display for the world to see, just like nutrition labels on food. Because knowing our footprint is the first step towards driving it to zero.A standard sneaker has a carbon footprint of 12.5 kg CO2e. And the average carbon footprint of all of our products is 7.6 kg CO2e. Okay, well, what\u2019s all that mean? We hear you, the numbers don\u2019t say all that much without some context. So if you\u2019re curious how our average footprint of 7.6 kg CO2e stacks up with your everyday life, it\u2019s about the same amount of emissions emitted by\u2026\u30fbDriving 19 miles in a car\n   \u30fbRunning 5 loads of laundry in the dryer\n   \u30fbMaking 22 chocolate barsOur ambition is to be like a tree, leaving the environment cleaner than we found it. That's why we believe in the power of natural materials, and their potential to transform ecosystems. We\u2019re looking beyond carbon neutrality, which means eventually, our business will be carbon negative.As we work to drive emissions to zero, we believe that we\u2014and all businesses, really\u2014should be held accountable for our environmental impact. So until we reach our goal of zero, we\u2019re taxing ourselves for the carbon we do emit, and investing in offsets to fund projects that neutralize our footprint.

Every time you scoop out more toothpaste, you introduce bacteria in the tub (especially if you use the toothbrush to scoop it out). They would need to compensate with either tiny tubs, or tons of antibacterials in the paste to prevent mold.Or removing it with a small spoonAntibacterial agents don't prevent moldI know there are tablets that turn into toothpaste. That could work similarly?But I feel like toothpaste is one of the things that's really difficult to do as zero waste. I quess you could probably do something like a glass/metal container that has some kind of pumping mechanism, couldn't you?I\u2019ve been using toothpaste tabs for years and love them!!I have only found one brand of tabs that have fluoride in them but they are less good than actual toothpaste. They perfectly do the job for my teeth but my gums make me problems since I use themYou guys aren\u2019t reusing your toothpaste tubes???  Who needs a glass or metal container with pumping mechanism when you have a functional shape already there.  It seems you\u2019re MAKING waste via the rut of zero waste conventions of repurposing.  Like, the toothpaste tube is great, reuse it too, just go to your local bulk toothpaste outlet and get them to pump in your tubes!This sounds like a sanitary nightmare.Especially when more than one person is using the toothpaste.We are in the midst of a global pandemic.  As I'm using up personal care products, I am rethinking the packaging through a Covid lens.  I'm now more likely to use things in pump or tube packaging (or even a bottle) as opposed to a jar/tub for sanitary reasons.  I never thought like this before.I'm in Canada, and our govt recently committed to have single-use plastics banned by such-and-such year. Thanks to covid, that's now completely out the window for the foreseeable future. :(I also re think certain things.  Toothpaste I have always continued to purchase in a tube. It takes a long time to use up a tube so I would rather focus on single use or steady use things vs a few tubes a year...That's why we try to use less waste during normal circumstances, so that during special circumstances like a pandemic, we can shift our priorities to sanitation without feeling too guilty.Glass is heavy and breakable (so more money and CO2 to ship and higher risk of needing to reship the broken ones adding more money and CO2), and you would need a plunger of some sort to get it out (adding more money, weight, and CO2 to the mix). Finally, most people dont have a refill store. Efforts would be better spent on a recyclable or compostable tubeI mean glass doesn't seem like a good idea for the reasons people mentioned... But why not a tin tube? Think like how tomato paste comes in like a toothpaste tube but it's tin and you poke a hole in it to start using it. I've had some medications come in tubes like that too, tretinoin and such.You might be a bit younger than me. This is how toothpaste used to come. Likely weight and durability are the downsides.I sometime have this vegetarian pate that come in tubes like that. The problem is although more easy to recycle doesn\u2019t mean it actually happens. This is probably due to the fact they are also fiendish to clean. Tablets are probably the way forward?Or a giant tube. Answer : profit.I have to travel a fair bit for work, and prefer travel for personal vacation. When I can I avoid airplanes, but when I can't I have a 2.75oz tube I save for TSA. Those tubes sold for air travel? Those are 0.25oz. Literally more plastic than paste.Zero WastersOnline"},

She loves it!I've done this with liver.  Slice while frozen to get the thickness right.  Also make sure you do it at a time when you can leave the windows open (you'll be dehydrating it for a long time and it is an...overwhelming smell.)  If you put the dehydrator outside, make sure you have it in a  secure location as it may draw wildlife.  For me, I prefer drying liver treats in the oven; I just put a cooling rack onto a cookie sheet and lay the liver over that.  I've found my cheap dehydrator doesn't dry through the middle unless I give it several days, where the warmer oven is a slightly faster process.  My dehydrator does chews better than an oven can (and it can make a unique kind of liver strip chew that's great but doesn't keep for more than a few days), but my oven is better at finishing these treats to a crisp.  Your mileage may vary if you have a quality dehydrator.  I'd also suggest using a bit of oil on whatever trays you use since the liver tends to stick.How do you dehydrate and conserve food without using massive amounts of plastics? All tutorials i find on YouTube involve miles of plastic wrap and sealable bags.I can't imagine dehydrating food WITH using plastic! I bought a sweet potato from the bulk bin, I washed it with a bamboo brush, I cut it into slices, I set it on the trays of the dehydrator and then turned it on.

It came in a three layer paper bag. I cut up the bag and ironed the pieces to make drawing paper for my kids. It will still get thrown away, but at least it's getting one more use first!We highly prefer extra thick rolled oats and the stores have been out. So I have ordered some rolled oats from a farm and they have not been steamed/shaped like conventional commercial oats. I'm excited to try them.How do you rank what packaging is least harmful to the environment when recycling is not available in your area? There are only so many things I can use glass jars for and I do compost paper and cardboard, but I still feel like a throw away a lot of stuff. Help!If not recycled, and only used once cardboard/paper is the best, plastic second best, and glass and metal worst. Both metal and glass are very energyconsuming in the production (and in recycling too!), glass is also heavy and difficult to transport efficiently. People tend to see glass jars as a good option in packaging, but you also have to consider the energy costs in production and the source of that energy.Zero Waste during a pandemic...I think I picked the worst timing possible to start on this \u201cjourney\u201d! Most stores won\u2019t let you bring in your own shopping bags (I still try, and I\u2019m just very careful not to put anything of my own on the belts or bagging areas.) Any bulk sections are empty in the stores I normally go to, and having food from a restaurant means you\u2019re only getting delivery or drive-thru, with no option of using your own containers.It\u2019s not that I disagree with businesses trying to be sanitary and careful. It just makes me feel that much more guilty about HAVING to use more trash for the sake of safety, knowing it\u2019ll all become landfill...For bags, just put things back in your cart and bag them at your car! And the first R is Refuse. I'm finding thatI'm buying just so much less in general that even though I'm making more waste around groceries, my total amount is waste is way down. As you said, it's a journey, so just look around and think about what is most feasible for you right now and do that. And then repeat when you're ready for something new. You can learn to fix and mend things, regrow scallions and lettuce, reduce energy usage, line dry your laundry, borrow instead of buying, walk or bike instead of drive, become creative with leftovers, reduce/ eliminate food waste, stay composing, etc.  These are all just ideas of things that maybe you  do.Zero waste really has become non-existent during COVID-19 (stating the obvious).Not too sure if this article has already been shared on Reddit. A newbie here and want to discuss/share with like-minded individuals. Luckily in Australia cases are low, which means I am able to take produce bags to the supermarket/market.I have attached an article via Time Magazine which accentuates the the anxiety many people are facing in the zero waste community. Oh, I went to the supermarket yesterday and saw a person putting one Capsicum into a plastic bag. And this is in the western world.Are there bars of soap that don't leave that \"squeaky clean\" feeling? I'm looking for zero waste soap solutions but I really dislike how your skin feels when you use bars of soap instead of shower gel or hand wash.Some of the lush body bar soaps come naked (without packaging) or in paper wrapping. I also dislike that feeling some bar soaps leave on your skin and many of the Lush products don\u2019t have that feeling. They have amazing values and all of their products are either vegan or vegetarian. They\u2019re also fighting animal cruelty and all of their products are handmade in factories. You can even watch videos on how their products are made so you know exactly what\u2019s in them. Hope this helps! :)Do you use a loofah or bath pouf with the soap? I usually don\u2019t have that bar soap scum problem if I use thoseHomemade soaps I think are better but obviously can get pricey.Maybe Dove? I like Yardley soap cause it\u2019s paraben and SLS free but still affordable!I hate that feeling too! I use Dove's beauty bars for that reason. They come in paperboard.Where do you live? I love the soap bars from Malin i Ratan (Sweden), they're not expensive (considering how long they last). If you can't find them in your area, I'm sure there must be alternatives as good as her soaps. y\u2019all got any zero waste hair tie alternatives? if not, a more sustainable way to use/buy hair ties. will also appreciate some ideas for what to do with a broken hair tie. i live in canada, and i don\u2019t do online shopping, if that helps narrow down your tips. Thanks!I'm trying to think of what's old school.Fantasy stories always talk about girls hair tied with ribbon.Maybe a bun. My friend used to use pens and chopsticks to keep her bun in place.I know mom re-uses broken hair ties when she makes purses and stuff like that. She sews on a button and then sews down the ends of the broken hair tie and ta-da she has a latch. Can't help on the zero waste hair tie alternatives - only thing I can think of is to reuse fabric scraps to tie back your hair?Cut up old tights or leggings? There are instructions onlineHere's a random one for us all...I'm from the UK, and while I do consume meat, I'm looking at meat-free alternatives to see what I'm missing out on.I've previously come across some veggie burgers which thankfully were in a cardboard box only, however most other things I come across are either inside plastic bags, or bags inside of boxes.Does anyone know of any other products which don't insist on using plastic packaging?Honestly, making them yourself. That way even if you\u2019re stuck with packaging, you get more product for the amount of waste. It\u2019s easier than it sounds. I used to make a pretty awesome chicken burger substitute out of chickpeas, vital wheat gluten, and spices in my college days before being diagnosed as unable to have gluten.Avoiding meat more than makes up for the impact of any packaging on meat-substitute products. Some items come canned (Asian mock duck, a seasoned wheat gluten product). For those that are frozen, try the \"shake test\" to see if you can hear what the packaging is like.I need moisturiser for my skin and lips. Refillable products aren't available to me. I did some research about home made creams and lip balms, but I got mixed results. So my question is, are they useful? I checked out  to get some opinions and the general idea seems to be \"don't ever do it, it won't work/you will have a bad time. Stick to products.\"one thing that seems to work for some people is using oils, but my skin is not suitable for that. is there any other option that I can consider? Or do I just buy the biggest bottle of moisturizer I can find?And what do you think about the homemade face masks? I want to try them, but most of them include some sort of dairy like milk or yoghurt. I don't buy face masks or anything, only basic stuff for my skin, but I recently noticed that it does need a bit of care, and I'm looking for ways to do it with the least amount of waste.

With a rested mind and digested memories, I always seem to read my photographs with a different eye.But this time is different.Looking at the pictures that I took in May of my speaking tour in South Africa and Mauritius, does not change my point of view at all: \u00a0Every second of my trip felt like a dream as I lived it. And when I look at my photos today, it still feels like one!\u00a0Let me show you what I mean\u2026\u2014\u2013With a two-day journey from San Francisco to South Africa forcing me to a 7 hour layover in Frankfurt, I saw this as a wonderful opportunity to give a talk in Germany (making the most of my trip lowers my carbon footprint but more on that at later). With the help of FES (Frankfurt\u2019s waste disposal agency), the owners of the unpackaged shop\u00a0\u00a0had organized a full house event.\u00a0I hopped back on the plane for another transcontinental flight. Since I refuse in-flight meals (I carry a sandwich in my cloth bag), I arrived in Johannesburg starving, but happy to find snacks in bulk in the terminal!I opted for nuts and the local jerky.Once in Cape Town, my stay was hosted by\u00a0dubbed Africa\u2019s greenest hotel. While I wish they offered composting receptacles in their rooms for my orange peel, and a room key other than plastic, other sustainable practices definitely stood out.The next morning, \u00a0a strenuous hike took me to the top of Table Mountain: I was surprised to see not only my first dassiebut also a very good sorting system of bins, including compost!After an abseil down,I participated in a couple of radio interviews, my favorite being with\u00a0, who said \u201cDang, your family\u2019s trash is smaller than my hair!\u201d LOLWhen I arrived at , tears flooded my eyes: This place is amazing.They had composting and they gave me a suite with a koi pond all to myself for Pete\u2019s sake!A walk and dinner on the beach and I was ready for some zzz\u2019s.The next morning, after a 5am rise for a TV interview, I headed to the Two Oceans Aquarium to be greeted by no other than a rescued penguin who fought his way out of the water, to hop on my lap and demand to be petted -just like Zizou, minus the water ;-).\u00a0The setting for my talk, which was sponsored by that night, was one of the best I have experienced. And it will be hard to beat!The following day, I took a sightseeing tour with a couple acquaintances,past some (more) penguins,and some baboons,all the way to Cape Point.A few hours later, I arrived in Plettenberg Bay and met Rhian, the unstoppable force behind who took the responsibility of organizing the amazing stays and sponsored transportation of this tour.She also put together a very successful event that night. I have never felt as much positive energy and prospects from an audience as I did there.After a restful night gracefully hosted by the Rhian took me on a walkto Robberg peninsula with her family.Then it was time to say goodbye over some bulk nuts,for  had offered to take me to my next stop\u2026A stay hosted by !As I sat contemplating the view, tears of gratitude filled my eyes again. I just wish I could have shared this with Scott!But I dried my tears of joy, and went for a safari, past the white rhinos\u2026and the elephants,ending the day with an alfresco cocktail as the sun went down.After an early game drive,it was time to leave. And leaving this place is not easy\u2026but I could not wait to get to Durban and meet Colleen, the icon of zero waste in South Africa, the woman behind  blog and this amazing tour! Inspired by our lifestyle, she has been able to also reduce her household\u2019s trash to a jar and she shows that zero waste is possible there too. Meeting her was like visiting a sister: We had never met in person but it\u2019s as if we had known each other our whole lives.After giving a well attended talk at she gave me a tour of Food Lovers Market, where she grocery shops.\u00a0I sure was impressed with the bulk selection\u2026from jerkyto cookiesI found myself with bulk envy!There was even a bread slicer available for customers.But Colleen was not yet done with me: the next day, she treated me to a sunrise snorkel,and then a microflight over Ballito.Right up my alley!We ended the morning ordering the most deceivingly wasteful drink I have ever seen (something, I would typically refuse, but this one deserved a picture and a fight),On the left: drink as shown on the menu. On the right: what was served, i.e, two coasters, 2 synthetic tea bags, 1 box! \u2013 And I am working on getting this changed!but the good memories take over the bad ones\u2026 I arrived in Johannesburg and met another angel: Noleen atAnd then, in the township of Alex, I met Mamvi.She is supported by FTFA to grow fruits and veggies, and I got to plant a tree with her!It was another full house and late night for my talk that day.Nonetheless, I was eager to wake up in the wee hours, for my third attempt at ballooning (my two other tries in California got cancelled for various reasons). And this time around, I was not disappointed.\u00a0The ride was, as you can imagine, breathtaking!After saying goodbye to the zebras,\u00a0I flew, nose and mouth covered (they spray insecticide down the whole length of the aisle),to Mauritius\u2026 but with these blue waters calling my name,I could not resist going snorkelingand litter picking.Compared with other beaches that I have cleaned up around the world, this ones was surprisingly trash free. I credit it to the locals maintaining them, but also to the fact that many of the drinks on the island are sold in returnables.Finally, I met\u00a0, who, with Mauritius Commercial Bank\u00a0,\u00a0organized by biggest event so far, with an audience of 1700 people! Not bad for an island and the conclusion of a tour!The next day, it was time to start heading home.But Noleen had a surprise reserved for my 5 hr layover back in Johannesburg: She drove me to the  of the township of Zandspruit to meet the staff of its very special swap shop.It\u2019s a place where residents like this man,can bring recyclables that they\u2019ve picked up in the streetsand get\u00a0credits to can spend towards clothes\u00a0and household items.What a wonderful incentive to reduce litter and provide necessities to those in need!What also caught my eye in this part of town is the beautiful presentation of the loose food sold on the sidewalks.From potatoes to tomatoesto onions.Time was running out as my flight home was approaching, but Noleen had yet another stop up her sleeve: no  tour would be complete without a visit to the local recycling center! And it did not disappoint: they pretty much sort as many types of material as my munipality in California does!They take metal and glass,cans,paper,plastics,and they even mulch!In a corner, I also found cardboard binders\u2026 Had I had room in my carry-on, I would definitely have picked up a couple for my boys: Perfect for back-to-school!\u2014\u2013Rest assured, I take none of this fantasy for granted. I am aware of how blessed I am to have been able to forge such amazing relationships throughout the world with the spreading of zero waste. And it keeps surprising me how big and wide the zero waste lifestyle movement is spreading.\u00a0Thank you, thank you to the amazing sponsors of this tour, thank you for giving me the gift of experience: incredible adventures and dear human interactions. My life has forever been enriched by your generosity. And so I hope, others\u2019 will also be, for you having brought my talks to them.\u00a0Thank you:And last but not least, thank you to the generous donors of the Durban event who have allowed for the offsetting of this entire tour!\u00a9 2020 Zero Waste Home.

What I did not foresee is the speed at which alternatives would come into place after my visit. To tell you more about it, I give the voice to Laura Cahill (right, on the photo below), member of \u2014\u2013I cannot count the amount of times I looked at a picture of a zero-waste shop on the Internet wishing we had such facilities here in Ireland. On holidays abroad, I would be standing in a market bristling with unpackaged fruit and vegetables, eggs and nuts, salamis and pasta. Heaven, I used to think with envy!Over the past decade, I got used to screening the shops for bulk or less wastefully packaged options. Putting the initial embarrassment aside, I use my Ikea glass boxes, linen bags and net produce bags with ease, and\u00a0shop where at least some items are available with no packaging. Zero-waste living in a country with no bulk store has been tricky, especially when studying, working and raising children. I often failed. I did not have time to plan, or I was too tired to go to other than the local convenience store.Fast forward to August 2017. After work and collecting my children from school, we are walking into my local \u00a0where Peadar refills my bottle with olive oil. The lovely \u00cdde from the Bring Your Own stall scoops my favorite tea leaves, rice and fusilli pasta into my linen bags. My 10-year old notices corn kernels, so we decide to get a small bag of those too. (\u2026my boys are making homemade popcorn now, so goodbye microwave popcorn rubbish!) Walking out of the store I feel contended and happy. Now off to the greengrocer\u2019s and my zero-waste shopping is done! Simple, pleasant, no-fuss.About a year ago, I joined the . The group had just over a hundred members, but I was delighted to became part of a company of like-minded individuals. They share my frustration with packaging and desire to make the world a better place, one glass jar at a time. I found myself in a welcoming party where people share ideas without judging, and encourage without pressurizing. A lot of us in this group \u201cgrew up\u201d on the Zero Waste Home , and We\u00a0looked at B\u00e9a Johnson\u2019s options for bulk shopping as something we might never achieve in Ireland.Stepping right out of my comfort zone, I decided to invite her to Dublin. She has encouraged so many people to open zero waste businesses all over the world, why would it not work in Dublin? Off I sent my e-mail, and almost immediately she replied, saying that she would love to come over to Ireland!Luckily, the Zero Waste Ireland Facebook crowd have some brilliant brains and helpful souls, so they helped me organise the visit. Over the process, the group was buzzing. Members shared the news of the Zero Waste Queen\u2019s visit with their friends, colleagues and families. Owners of existing businesses joined and started to offer zero-waste alternatives of their products. By the time of B\u00e9a\u2019s 14th March talk, Zero Waste Ireland had well over 6000 (Yes, six thousand!) members.After her refreshingly energising and informative talk, in a jam-packed theatre in Trinity College, the excitement was still palpable in the foyer. Ms Johnson was surrounded by students, moms with babies on their arms, professionals in suits, pensioners, housewives, a wonderful mix of people from all parts of the country. She had time for everyone, was relaxed, pragmatic and down-to-earth. Even though she had given two previous talks earlier in schools, she was happy to go out for a pint of Guinness, and continue chatting to and inspire people until late.And the magic happened.Since her visit, five zero-waste shops opened:\u00a0,\u00a0,\u00a0,\u00a0, and\u00a0.Even better, some of these shops are mobile-shops, they travel within the city and the country selling everything from dishwasher detergent, to rice, nuts, grains, castile soap and bicarbonate soda. Their range of products are growing. As well as purchasing spaghetti and raisins, you can get your bamboo toothbrushes, reusable bottles and menstrual cups! They are in touch with their customers, they listen, and supply the demand. Shopping is easy and straightforward; the price is good; the produce is also of quality and available with not too much inconvenience for an increasing amount of people.This summer, the country hosted its very first . Not a single-use cup in sight, but hundreds of people shopping (using their own jars and bags), chatting over a (reusable) cup of coffee, attending talks, watching zero-waste related films and learning about the practicalities at workshops.Over 13 years ago, I remember savouring the lines from a Thomas Merton book: \u201cWhy do we have to spend our lives striving to be something we would never want to be, if we only knew what we wanted? Why do we waste our time doing things which, if we only stopped to think about them, are just the opposite of what we were made for?\u201d I remember looking at all the plastic packaging in my kitchen, the knick-knacks in my sitting room from well-meaning family members, the superfluous \u2018must haves\u2019 for the impending arrival of my first son. I gasped for simplicity and freedom under the suffocating clutter of waste.It has been a long and slow journey for me and my family to move towards creating a minimal amount of waste, but the Zero Waste Ireland group and B\u00e9a Johnson\u2019s visit to Dublin has accelerated the change. Not just for me, but for the whole country. Thank you!\u00a9 2020 Zero Waste Home. All Rights Reserved. "},

I hold the title with great pride. We own 100 of them. But we\u2019re not talking about a mismatched collection of pickle and mayo containers here: I exclusively use French canning jars.My love affair for\u00a0, goes way back. Like most Frenchies, I hold a nostalgic connotation to the brand. Growing up in the South of France, I watched my mom, grandmother, and great grandmother use these jars for canning all sort of things: pears, green beans, jams, tomato sauce, pate, headcheese, you name it. Before freezing methods were developed, this was one of the best ways to preserve food!But my favorite memory about these jars goes back to just a decade ago. My dad invited me to the family home, a modest 17\u00a0century stone farmhouse set deep in the countryside, to lunch with a long lost first cousin. Having shared the same grandparents, she and I perused the property, recollecting childhood memories. We visited the barn and what used to be my late grandmother\u2019s chicken coop and vegetable garden, before making our way into an annex where she\u2019d store her stash of cured meats, dried herbs and canned goods. Much to our surprise, much of her canning still lined the shelves, with some dating back to the 1970\u2019s! One of them read: Plums in Spirits 1977. My cousin and I turned to each other with the same idea in our heads, smiled in approval, opened it and took a sip as you would a chalice at church. I don\u2019t have much of a sweet tooth, but to this day, it remains the best desert I have ever had. When my dad later found out what we had done, he got mad at me for opening what he considered an heirloom, but I have no regret: Its made for the best memory my cousin and I share.Yet, I only started using Le Parfait jars in my own home in my early thirties. It\u2019s not canning but rather a frustration with Tupperware that lead me back to them. The warping of the plastic in the dishwasher and the microwave (yes, I did that! I was so clueless back then!), the staining in contact with tomato sauce, the constant search for matching tops (no matter what technique I used to organize them), etc\u2026 So by the time I started to reduce our plastic use (in 2006), I had already swapped most of our Tupperware for Le Parfait jars to store leftovers. But as soon as we adopted a zero waste lifestyle, they went viral in our home. We started using them for everything:To store leftovers in the fridge (thus allowing us to eliminate aluminum foil, plastic wrap, wax paper and ziplock bags),but also to stock bulk in our pantry,freeze scraps for later use,grocery shop sans packaging,can tomato sauce at the end of summer,pack a snack for travel and school,dispense hankies as you would tissues from a box,hold Zizou\u2019s food and water (it\u2019s the only water bowl that we\u2019ve found not to spill),\u2026They\u2019ve even replaced our trash bags!\u00a0\ud83d\ude09Multi-functionality is one of the most important qualities that, as a minimalist, I look for in a product and it\u2019s probably the best perk of using them. But here are 13 other reasons, why I prefer these jars over other designs:: The can dating from 1977 is great proof of that!: They\u2019ve eliminated bug infestation in our pantry and therefore food waste.: We use them to buy anything wet, from olive oil to ice cream to meat, and we don\u2019t have to worry about spillage in our grocery totes.: Unlike Tupperware or aluminum, we can see what they hold, so no food gets forgotten and therefore thrown away.: My collection ranges from tiny (to hold the horseradish recipe in the\u00a0) to very big (to store often-used staples like flour).: The same top and gasket fit different body sizes, so if the body of an 12oz. jar breaks, I can use its top and gasket on that of a 2qt. one.: The company will tell you not to reuse gaskets, but I personally do. A small stretch test will indicate to me if the gasket is sound or in bad condition and based on the test, I throw them in one of 2 jars that I use to collect gaskets. I\u2019ll use the best ones for canning \u2013 and double check airtightness when my cans have cooled by pulling on the lid.: Event decorators buy them as displays for a special occasion, so it\u2019s easy to find them in thrift stores at the end of the wedding season.: Unlike mason jars, the lid is connected to the body, therefore simplifying cleaning. I throw them in the dishwasher face down with all parts attached: lid open and gasket on.: They are much lighter than their Italian cousin (Bormioli brand), and therefore easier to carry.: The metal lids of Ball and Kerr mason jars are lined with plastic and used to contain Bisphenol A, so buying them secondhand puts you at risk of contamination. With Le Parfait, your food comes in contact with only glass.: Unlike a mason type jars, all components can be separated, and therefore disposed of if broken. Metal and glass in recycling bin, the gasket in my jar of trash.: I can be all about Zero Waste, but I also care about having a beautiful interior\u00a0\ud83d\ude09\u00a0There is no doubt that replacing disposables with them has added beauty to our everyday life.Moreover, I am particularly impressed with the company reaching out to me a few years back, highly motivated to make their products better. I brought up discrepancies in the material used for the gasket (latex in Europe, which is technically biodegradable; synthetic rubber in North America, which isn\u2019t), but also the plastic packaging used to ship the jars. While Le Parfait North America is now looking into bringing natural gaskets to the continent, our collaboration led them to launch\u00a0. So now, you can feel confident knowing that your jars will be delivered with paper and cardboard only!I get pounded on a daily basis for requests to promote products: From flimsy bidet attachments to expandable reusable straws. I refuse to support products that I would not personally purchase or use. Le Parfait is one of the very few brands out there that I am happy to promote: The jars have been a great tool in simplifying our lives and reducing our household waste. I hope you\u2019ll enjoy them as much as I have!\u00a9 2020 Zero Waste Home. All Rights Reserved. "},

In Taipei, I celebrated the launch of the  with my translator, Jessica, a traditional Chinese medicine student: I became one of her patients for a day (more on that later).

If my two hungry teenagers hadn\u2019t refused the meal on the flight over, I would have had time to take a picture for you \ud83d\ude0aI come back from Asia blown away. Not only by the vibrant zero waste community I had no idea I had inspired there, but also by the new \u201cways\u201d I learned. Every part of the world harbors secrets on getting close to zero. In sharing those that we discover through our travels, we have the power to inspire others to do the same in their part of the world \u2013 and if all the pieces of the puzzle come together, we\u2019ll ultimately create a zero waste society, right?\u00a0\u00a0In Taipei, I lost my voice. Quite an inconvenience when you\u2019re kicking off a speaking tour! \ud83d\ude09 Everyone tried to help me: The cab driver offered Strepsils, my publisher herbal teas, a talk host peppermint drops, a store owner a honey tea, my audience herbal lozenges in all forms, Jessica acupuncture dots in my ears, her fianc\u00e9 (a western medicine doctor) a prescription for steroids\u2026 He took me to a pharmacy, conversed with the pharmacist and to my surprise, asked me if I had a container to put the pills in! Yep, meds in bulk: This was a first for me!If you read  or follow my Insta stories, you know about my obsession for ponytail holders:\u00a0 I find them everywhere in the US (today alone, I found 5 on a 2 hour walk). Despite my \u201cradar\u201d for them, I only found one during this month-long trip through Asia: Does Asian hair hold onto ties better than western hair? Do people not buy them there or are they more careful about not losing them? The answer remains a mystery.\u00a0Unlike the US (but very much like Europe), finding a place to eat in reusables is easy and street vendors will graceful accept to fill your container.The markets are plenty and filled with options.Ironically, I found that places dealing with litter issues happen to also have the most unpackaged options! Vietnam for example, is sadly one of the most littered places I have visited this decade\u2026and yet it has the most bulk that I have seen anywhere too.Those of you who\u2019ve tried to give me a freebie or sample on one of my tours, know that I systematically refuse material gifts, but when Feel Good approached me with their , I could not resist. I wanted to try it! If it works for our family, we\u2019ll be closer to zero waste next year! Note: I also accepted a menstrual cup on this tour (after 10 years of use, mine started to fall apart \u2013 I embraced the new one but added the old one to our emergency earthquake kit).\u00a0When I visited Asia 20 years ago, I drank bottled water only, and so do most visitors today. But with the zero waste lifestyle and my \u201cnew vision\u201d for all things bulk and unpackaged this time around, I found that going bottle-less is actually quite simple. If you train your eye to find filtered water, you actually find it everywhere (and at night, you can always boil tap water in your hotel room with the electric kettles provided). Here are a few examples:Bonus: At, they don\u2019t even sell bottled water or use disposable straws. They use bamboo straws and ask their customers to use filtered water (an empty bottle is made available in each room for that purpose).\u00a0This is not waste-related, but I thought I\u2019d share this with you if you plan on visiting Asia and are as clueless as I was\u2026 With the size of my European nose, the occasional sneeze and drip from eating spicy foods, I always carry a hankie and I am not shy to use it when needed. I am now embarrassed to write that I did blow my nose in public in Asia, only to find out upon my return to the US, that it is rude to do so there. Just as rude as spitting and farting in public are, in my part of the world: Yikes! Live to learn\u2026>> I\u2019LL SPARE YOU THE VISUAL ON THIS POINT<<\u00a0 \ud83d\ude42\u00a0During my trip in Malaysia, I had the pleasure to visit  and meet its founder, Claire Sancelot. A vibrant chatty French lady, she was inspired by my book and that of  to simplify her life and ultimately open an unpackaged store. She aims at bringing a wide selection of bulk, organic, gluten free, paleo and vegan products, while supporting local communities and charities as much as possible. They organize workshops, classes to a more sustainable living too. Quite a feat! Here are some pics to inspire you to open such store in your neck of the woods:Throughout Asia, this Buddhist organization has centers that accept a variety of materials. Plastics, paper, cans, wire, etc. Young and old alike volunteer to sort, separate and dismantle the donated materials with a discipline and dedication, like I\u2019ve never witnessed in any other recycling center in the world. Here are a few examples:This is something that France seriously needs to consider. I still use disposable paper tickets there when I use the metro in Paris! They could just as well adopt the reusable system as found in Asia. Drop the coin in, and the door opens\u2026Oh! and when I was given a luggage tag for my carry-on on the express bus to the Taipei airport, I stuck the luggage sticker back on the label upon arriving, and my driver took it back to reuse.All over the world, zero wasters are working really hard to get their city to pick up organic, compostable waste; especially in dense areas, where apartment dwellers are not keen to using an indoor  or .\u00a0 In the district of Beijing however, the bins are there. The contents are very contaminated for now, but at least the city has the system in place for when people will be ready (or informed on how) to use them. In Vietnam, recycling is typically organized by individuals\u00a0(scrap brokers known as \u201cdong nat\u201d or \u201cve chai\u201d) rather than by the city. But in Hoi An, we found a compost receptacle reserved for tourists (\u201corganics recycle bin for tourists\u201d) \u2013 only I did not have time to verify its contamination level because our bikes were getting towed!(Apart from my nose blowing mishap), I hope that my recap will inspire you to introduce some of these ideas to your part of the world if they do not yet exist.Upcoming speaking tours will take me through the US in April, Eastern Europe in May, and Namibia in June.

The active ingredient in vinegar is acetic acid, the amount of which varies from product to product. It can be used to clean a variety of surfaces, such as glass and stainless steel. Some sources recommend diluting acetic acid, so you don't damage what you're cleaning. It is best to treat this as something that cleans, but does not reliably disinfect, unless you start ordering straight acetic acid from chemical companies.

So let's say you've separated out the solid waste and landfilled it - what about the litter?Cat litter comes in many forms. Some of it is clumping, some of it isn't. Some of it is clay-based, some isn't. Some is made from compostable stuff like walnuts or sawdust or wheat or newspaper, some is made from ~mysterious crystals~ that are probably from outer space.Do. Not. Flush. Any. Of. It.Some of it claims to be , so again, I advise you to contact your local water supplier and ask if it's okay to flush \"flushable\" cat litter. (And post  when you get a response, I'm curious to know what they say!)A lot of it is designed to be absorbent, which means when it gets into a wet environment, like a toilet, it swells up and causes blockages. Some of it turns into a . If it's inert it's still going to collect in pipes. Even when it is compostable, because it's made of wheat or something, it's not gonna compost in a sewage system! Compost takes  and needs oxygenated conditions (unlike those found underwater), so if it's in a toilet or in a sewage system it's just going to collect, and if you keep flushing it then more and more will collect until eventually you have something serious and expensive.Even if you only flush tiny amounts (like one or two granules stuck to a cat poop (DO NOT FLUSH CAT POOP)), everything that isn't human waste will contribute to a . These are especially likely in built-up densely populated areas. (Relatedly, do not put anything remotely like fat or oil down any kind of drain, ever. Pour it on newspaper or something and throw it in the bin.)If it's compostable and you know it is, by all means  like, in a compost bin.  Stuff doesn't magically dissolve and evaporate when it gets into a sewer. If you know your litter is compostable, let's imagine an ideal scenario where the cat litter composts in the sewer. Do you think a compost heap is a good idea in a system that is designed to be mainly flowing water, where no one will ever be able to put it on their garden? If it does somehow flow through the system it will be incinerated.Landfill is the best place for it. Good lord do not compost it in your apartment or on your balcony.Dispose of it in bags with your household waste.  (Remember, fatbergs are more likely in densely populated places!) You cannot escape the bags, but you can find bags that would otherwise go to landfill and use those before you use the new bags. Maybe ask friends for their unwanted, used, hole-free plastic carrier bags?If you don't have a way to do this that's not disgusting you should probably not have a cat in your apartment, which means you might have to think creatively to make things less disgusting! Maybe ask your landlord about a secure outdoor way to store cat litter before it's collected for landfill?If it's made from waste products (like recycled newspaper or by-product sawdust) then it's better than just making something new.If it's going to landfill and it's compostable it will degrade and produce methane in the airtight environment of landfill. Methane is (, at least) 100 times worse for climate change than CO2.

It's okay to put on the ground around fruit trees, for example.So unless you are composting it then I guess your best bet is to go for a hypothetical something that is made from an unwanted by-product and that isn't biodegradable?They're obligate carnivores, which means the environmental impact of feeding a cat is equivalent to running a small car.

But if you\u2019ve ever had lunch in a school cafeteria, where you can watch how quickly the trashcans fill up with everyone\u2019s wrappers, empty milk cartons and other disposables, going waste-free seems like an increasingly important mission.By investing in reusable products in place of disposables, you can cut down significantly on the waste you generate. To see how quickly you make a difference, stock up on reusable plastic, metal and glass containers in various sizes, travel bottles, cloth or reusable bags for packing sandwiches and snacks, and cloth napkins \u2014 you\u2019ll find your reducing your waste footprint instantly.Need more good reasons? Here are five:Although buying good-quality reusable containers might initially seem like a big expense, you\u2019ll quickly see savings over time. For instance, if you\u2019re paying $1 for each carton of organic milk, think of how much cheaper it would be to spend $15 on an insulated bottle and be able to refill it from the tap, or the more economically priced gallon jug of milk at home. The packages of zip-top bags and plastic wrap also quickly add up, outweighing the initial purchase of a sturdy container that can be used again and again. Portioning your own snacks from a bulk package also saves money over buying individually wrapped versions.\u00a0It makes perfect sense: The fewer wrappings, packaging and non-recyclables like juice or milk boxes you use, the less trash you\u2019ll generate. The EPA estimates that every child who packs disposable lunches\u00a0. If everyone did their part to incorporate reusable containers into their packed lunches, it could really make an impact.\u00a0\n\u00a0Getting creative about the meals and snacks you pack in reusable containers is also the perfect opportunity to eat healthier, since you can make foods from scratch, with healthier ingredients, rather than opting for the processed, prepackaged versions. Try making your\u00a0\u00a0or\u00a0\u00a0for starters.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0The fewer disposable packages purchased, the fewer made. This means fewer raw materials and less energy used in production, less pollution and fuel to transport it, and maybe even one less car trip to the store for you to purchase it.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Help your kids develop green habits early by explaining to them why you\u2019re packing their lunch in reusable packages. Explain the importance of conserving our resources, reusing things and to\u00a0. They\u2019re sure to get on board, particularly if you let them pick out their own reusables!\n"},

Estimates suggest that Americans produce around 4.5 pounds of waste per day, and while the US represents only 4% of the global population, they are responsible for around . Put simply, it\u2019s time to take a good, hard look at our personal waste generation.However, while those figures may be shocking, there are some people generating  by reevaluating our \u201ctake, make, dispose\u201d culture and adopting a zero-waste approach. This growing movement is designed to slash waste output and place greater emphasis on valuing resources, with the added bonus that it may save you some cash and give you a host of new skills at the same time.So, if you\u2019re interested in zero waste, or you simply want to cut down your waste generation, we\u2019ve brought together a wealth of zero waste tips to help you get started. Read on to discover how, room by room, you can make a difference for the planet and begin to design out waste!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When it comes to your bathroom, there\u2019s an abundance of scented products wrapped in plastic that aren\u2019t easily recycled. Add to this, disposable items such as toilet paper, cotton swabs, and other single-use items, and the smallest room in your house becomes the biggest waste generator.Data taken from  shows that in 2018 alone more than 120 billion units of cosmetics packaging were produced globally. In fact, Netherlands-based group  found that if refillable containers were used for cosmetics, as much as 70% of carbon emissions associated with the beauty industry could be eliminated.As consumers, we have the power to steer cosmetic companies to implement more sustainable practices and move towards sustainable and refillable packaging, and there are plenty of ways to  and increase pressure on the industry.For example, swapping shampoo and conditioner bottles for bars will not only reduce plastic waste but take up less space too (both in your bathroom and along shipping routes from the factory to your home). There are also alternatives for , and the option to  and make your own cosmetics.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two billion plastic razors a year end up in landfill. Switching to reusable razors or  is highly encouraged.\u00a0Switch to makeup that is packaged in reusable containers or uses post-consumer recycled material. Additionally, recycle your used mascara wands through .\u00a0Spray deodorants not only create plenty of packaging waste, but also use hydrocarbons and/or compressed gases notorious for their contribution to global warming. Use refillable or  instead.\u00a0Cotton production takes an incredible amount of water and other resources, and many cotton-based products in the bathroom are single-use. Try  instead of single-use makeup removers or .\u00a0Traditional toothpaste is packaged in plastic tubes and often uses questionable ingredients. Why not  when you likely have all the essentials in your home? A win for the environment and your smile.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The fashion industry is considered the , and the rise of fast fashion over the past two decades is compounding the problem on a shocking scale. Not only does the manufacturing of garments create huge amounts of waste, but the garments themselves are very often damaging to the environment.Did you know that polyester, and other synthetic materials, are made up of tiny fibers that are making their way from your washing machine into our water supplies? These tiny threads shed from the fabric have been found on shorelines and in fish on both the macro and the micro level. found that on average synthetic fleece jackets release 1.7 grams of microfibers during each wash, with older jackets shedding almost twice as many when compared to new jackets. These fibers travel from your washing machine to your local wastewater treatment plan, with around 40% of them entering rivers, lakes, and oceans.The best way to avoid these microfibers is to purchase clothes that are made of natural fibers. Of course, as consumers we can only purchase what is sold by companies and in the market, however, purchasing new \u201ceco\u201d clothing when we still have plenty of serviceable garments in our wardrobes is not always the answer. Using what we have to the end of its useful life and then mending wherever possible is an option. Alternatively, simply  less often is also becoming more popular and helping to extend the life of wardrobes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 are now turning to waste as raw materials within their products, recycling everything from ocean plastic through fishing nets to old tires.\u00a0For clothes that are gathering dust in your wardrobe or no longer fit, swapping, selling, or donating helps minimize waste and conserve resources.\u00a0To help minimize microplastics entering the water,  that can be used to wash potentially harmful garments are now available.\u00a0Old clothing, particularly cotton, can be used as rags, filters, or filling for cushions.

Current estimates suggest that around 30% of garbage in the United States is from containers and packaging, and most plastic films and bags cannot be put in your regular recycling bin.An easy way to avoid excess packaging in your kitchen is to purchase items in bulk. In many large cities there are , however, if you don\u2019t have a packaging-free store near you, wholesale stores make it easy to shop in bulk, helping you reduce your impact on the environment and, in most cases, save money. By purchasing your pantry staples in the largest manageable size, the amount of packaging is reduced as well as the number of trips to the grocery store\u2014saving CO2 emissions on frequent transport trips.When it comes to plastic bags, recycling is essentially impossible, as they gum up the machines within recycling facilities and cause multiple issues. Some grocery stores have collection bins for plastic bags and films, but as always, it\u2019s best to swap and switch to multi-use bags that can be reused instead of relying on single use.Reusable food wrap, such as  and other brands have been created to eliminate additional plastic waste and provide a natural alternative to plastic wrap for food storage. Silicone oven paper is another good option to replace single-use items like parchment paper and aluminum foil. In many cases, these products can be reused within your kitchen to store food or cook with.Minimizing  is another avenue to explore\u2014with organics forming the largest single component of MSW in the US\u2014and organizing your pantry to cut out waste is the first place to start. This should be an ongoing project, and planning meals around what needs to be eaten, rather than what you want to eat, will help you avoid waste by ensuring food never goes bad.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Composting food waste is not only reserved for those with a garden.  alongside vermicomposting can be practiced in a home or apartment.\u00a0Although having fallen out of favor, many \u201cwaste\u201d food items can be eaten. For example, carrot tops can be used for pesto, broccoli leaves for salad, and potato skins for homemade chips.\u00a0 minimizes single-use packaging. It has also been shown to reduce the amount of harmful chemicals in your home.\u00a0For things like oat milk, almond milk, and coconut milk, you can simply soak dried products in water to  and completely cut out packaging waste.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The home office is growing in popularity, with more people than ever working from home for at least part of the week. This means that all of that waste usually confined to the office, be that paper, plastic, food waste, and e-waste, will now need to be dealt with by you., in particular, is the fastest growing waste stream in the US, and striving for zero waste is highly important when you consider the amount of resources used in its manufacture and its potential toxicity when disposed of improperly. Additionally, the fact that e-waste is not easily recycled further compounds the issue, and so increasing awareness surrounding zero e-waste techniques is paramount.Ensuring you use your electronic products for their entire life span, rather than upgrading unnecessarily, will help to reduce the number of devices in circulation. Additionally, selling or donating unused devices to someone who can use them will help keep resources in circulation.One particular issue surrounding e-waste is , and in an effort to combat this, the  is currently gaining traction around the world. It\u2019s hoped that the movement will increase pressure on manufacturers to design more easily repairable devices that can be used for longer, with the movement also pointing the way towards modular electronics that can be \u201cinfinitely\u201d upgraded.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moving and storing your data in the cloud means less demand on your hardware and a reduced dependence on portable storage devices.\u00a0Printers not only contribute to e-waste once units are no longer usable, but also more than 375 million empty ink and toner cartridges are thrown out each year. Then, of course, there is the paper issue! If printing is necessary, source a responsibly-forested paper.\u00a0If your devices use regular AA or AAA batteries, use rechargeable batteries to cut down waste.\u00a0Wherever possible, buy accessories that work with everyone\u2019s devices. Alternatively, moving your household to the same brand of devices can cut down on chargers, power adapters, headphones, and cables.\u00a0\u00a0The zero-waste movement itself is growing quickly, and today, there are many more options available to consumers than even two or three years ago. As it continues to expand, it should become both easier and cheaper for everyone to minimize waste and keep resources in circulation as long as possible. This, in turn, will help the  deal with \u201ctrue\u201d waste more effectively, allowing more materials to be kept out of landfill.At this point, it is also worth remembering that zero waste is a journey and not a destination. Each step on that journey requires continual assessment and implementing some or all of these methods in your household will take time. However, starting that journey now will give you time to assess, sort, and plan\u2013finding a system that works for you. Additionally, talking about your journey with others will help spread further awareness of how we can eliminate waste and encourage more people to get on board.Prefer to have a downloadable version of this guide?

You might be wondering why?I\u2019ve started placing ads on my blog to try and recoup some of the costs of blogging. Blogging is not free. I have been paying for all of the costs associated with blogging for over a year and a half.I love this little hobby of mine, but as my audience grows the cost gets bigger. And, at this point in time, I would have to either scale back blogging, get a fourth job, or try and monetize.The ads you\u2019re seeing on the site are subject to what you\u2019ve been viewing. Mine are mostly Broadway HD, Solar Panels, Electric Cars, and Ethical Fashion ads. But, as the ad company explained to me; if you\u2019ve been looking at Panda Express, you\u2019re probably going to see a Panda Express ad.Granted, this isn\u2019t always the case, but they try to operate off that algorithm. Also, the Broadway HD ads have totally worked! If anyone is wondering what to buy me for Christmas\u2026 I will gladly accept a Broadway HD membership.If at any time,\u00a0you find an ad you don\u2019t like, there is a tag down in the bottom of the ad that says \u201cReport This Ad.\u201d Please report it, if you don\u2019t like it!This is a personal blog and all views expressed are mine. All content and photos are mine unless otherwise stated.All recipes need to stay on the zero waste website. You are more than welcome to link to my website with a picture.

I use these to showcase products I own, or very similar in the case of my wardrobe. Affiliate links don\u2019t change the price of the item, but I make a small commission if you choose to purchase.Occasionally, I do. Most of my posts are freelance on other people\u2019s websites about waste reduction. One or two might pop up on Going Zero Waste. If they arise, I will be talking about products or companies that I stand behind like .\u00a0They are the BEST!\u00a0I will never be dishonest and all opinions will be mine.If you think your company is top-notch sustainable, drop me a I truly love blogging and interacting with you. If blogging happened to become my full time job, I would ecstatic. It would free me to do the work I am truly passionate about.I would be able to do workshops in schools, teach kids about the positive impact they can have on the planet.\u00a0I\u2019d open a small co-op.\u00a0I\u2019d host classes to teach lower income families how to eat healthy and well on a budget.I have so many dreams, and if this happened to be my stepping stone \u2013 I would embrace it.But, I\u2019m not willing to sacrifice my ethics or intentions to get there. Making money never has and never will be the goal of Going Zero Waste.My goal is to reach as many people as possible. To prove that zero waste living is not an exclusive club. But, most people can do something to make a difference in their lives and community. There is no right or correct way \u2013 there are 1000 different paths.

So much is different. While many of us are dealing with a whole new world of stress and uncertainty, it\u2019s nice to find a silver lining sometimes.With so much extra time at home with our kids, it has been a great time to teach our youngsters a few of the life lessons and educational tidbits that often got pushed to the wayside during \u201cnormal business hours\u201d.In our house, we\u2019ve been cooking and  and even started teaching our boys to clean bathrooms this past weekend.We\u2019ve also had time for more creative projects and experiments. Today, I want to share three fun and educational projects about sustainability that you can do with your kids, including teenagers.Yes, even teenagers.I promise they are far more exciting than cleaning toilets and maybe even more fun than baking brownies.As we share with our kids the importance of reducing waste and caring for the environment, these three experiments capture the science behind our sustainability initiatives.\u00a0Jess is a former high school chemistry teacher and mom of two. On her Instagram account, she shares weekly .\u00a0Many of her lessons include plans in English and Spanish, to help teachers and parents explore the science behind sustainability and eco-friendly living with their children and students.Her lesson plans are free, linked to the U.S. National Science Standards and Common Core Standards for ELA and Math, include details about materials needed and any set up that is required (though most of her experiments require very little preparation).Not only are they great for science skills, but they are perfect conversation starters for discussing environmental issues with our kids in a way that is accessible to them.\u00a0A couple of weeks ago, we tried a food waste audit to track how much perfectly good food ended up in our trash cans or compost bins.It\u2019s pretty interesting how much we can learn about our unconscious behaviors when we start to track them.\u00a0Through the food waste audit, my boys paid a whole lot more attention to how much food they wasted.Each person in our family was responsible for writing down their own food waste, which added an additional element of individual accountability.The experiment also gave them a chance to practice science and math skills like measuring volume, tracking activities, creating and maintaining a data table and adding.Globally, food loss and waste accounts for a tremendous amount of greenhouse gas emissions.The World Resources Institute stated that \u201cif food loss and waste were its own country, it would be the world\u2019s third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases \u2013 surpassed only by The United States and China.\u201d ()One main reason that wasting food is a serious issue has to do with how it decomposes.When food is placed in the trash and sent to a landfill, it breaks down anaerobically, which means in the absence of oxygen.This decomposition process creates carbon dioxide and methane gas. When food is composted or breaks down naturally (like an apple that falls from a tree and rots on the ground) it breaks down aerobically, which means in the presence of oxygen.The decomposition process creates carbon dioxide and water vapor.The problem lies with the production of methane gas.Scientists have determined that this gas is really good at trapping heat in our atmosphere \u2013 approximately twenty-five times better than carbon dioxide.Due to methane\u2019s heat-trapping power, along with its lifespan in our atmosphere, it is a key player in raising our global temperatures, which causes our climate to change.There are many individual ways to avoid food waste.However, in order to avoid wasting food you must first identify what is being wasted in your home.That\u2019s where this experiment comes into play. By recording everything you throw away for a week, you\u2019ll have a better sense of where your food waste comes from, and then, be able to address how to decrease this misuse of nourishment.If you follow Kathryn regularly, you know she\u2019s a fan of growing food from scraps.It\u2019s such a great way to remind ourselves that what we might initially consider trash isn\u2019t necessarily waste. The \u201cremnants\u201d of our food can be used for so many things like growing food scraps, composting, feeding chickens, and more.\u00a0In this experiment, Jess shows us how to pot certain types of food scraps and watch them grow. In her lesson plan, she incorporates skills like making observations, measuring, creating a graph and analyzing data.Your kids could even try creating a hypothesis before you start to experiment and make educated guesses along the way about what will happen next.\u00a0As stated previously, when leftover food gets thrown in the trash and sent to a landfill, it creates a gas called methane.This gas is really good at trapping heat in our atmosphere. As more heat gets trapped, the climate of Earth changes, affecting the plants and animals, including humans, that live there.There are lots of ways we can avoid food waste.Planning your meals ahead of time with your family, donating or sharing food you aren\u2019t going to eat, eating leftovers, freezing food scraps to make soups, regrowing your food scraps and composting are all ways to save food from being wasted.In this lesson, you will learn how to regrow a vegetable from a scrap, monitor its vertical growth for 2 weeks and discuss the ecological importance of reducing food waste.Food decomposing properly with oxygen in a compost bin is a much different process than food decomposing in a landfill without oxygen.Jess uses this experiment to show us how different foods produce different amounts of greenhouse gases when sent to a landfill.We\u2019ve discussed what happens when food breaks down in a landfill.This experiment allows you to actually see the process!By choosing different types of foods, (as some foods are prone to produce more gases during decomposition than others) you will be able to watch the chemical breakdown of each food source and the relative amount of gas it produces.By filling each test bottle completely with water, you create anaerobic (oxygen-lacking) environments that simulate the rudimentary conditions found at a landfill. You\u2019ll be surprised by how quickly some of the balloons inflate!This experiment can lead you and your learners to investigate the type of landfill that your waste travels to.Is it a methane-recapture landfill, in which the methane that is produced is trapped and used to produce electricity, thus mitigating some of the negative effects of the landfill?Or does your waste get sent to a traditional landfill that does not capture the gases that are produced?Or maybe your waste doesn\u2019t get sent to a landfill at all, but rather an incinerator? Researching what happens in your community can be a gateway to shaping young learners into environmental stewards.All three of these experiments are really interesting for kids and adults, and they can be set up in just a few minutes with materials you probably already have at home.We learned last year that our young people might be the best hope for motivating our leaders to be change-makers.\u00a0We can teach kids about the importance of environmental issues through , educational podcasts, school programs, and more.But by letting them experiment with the science allows for a global issue to become local, making the lessons much more impactful.\u00a0By educating young people about the science behind why sustainability matters, hopefully, we can make them even more effective advocates for the planet (and stay sane while quarantined at home in the process).\u00a0 Jen Panaro is a self-proclaimed composting nerd and advocate for eco-friendly living for modern families. On her blog, , she shares ideas about how families can incorporate low waste and sustainable habits into everyday living. She\u2019s a serial library book borrower, a messy gardener, curator of the , and mom to two boys. Additionally, she may or may not spend an unusual amount of time admiring the hard-working worms in her compost bin; the jury is still out on the matter.\u00a0Jess Purcell is a Chemistry teacher turned stay-at-home Mom who is passionate about explaining the science behind sustainable living. She is the creator of  that provides simple sustainability science experiments that can be done at home. Jess lives in central Pennsylvania with her husband, two kids, and two cats and can usually be found outside, either digging in her gardens, hiking with her family or attempting to read a book while being cajoled into a game of hide and seek.

If that sounds like you, then you\u2019re in the right place!I hope that you\u2019ll be inspired to implement a few of these this week and beyond. Be sure to let me know which actions you\u2019ll be taking in the comment section down below.I\u2019ll be covering ways you can be an activist and without ever leaving your couch and listing a few ways that you can celebrate Earth Day from home.Up first, let\u2019s talk about energy. On average, 40% of global CO2\u00a0emissions\u00a0are emitted from\u00a0electricity\u00a0generation. ()So one quick thing you can do whether you live in an apartment or rent is to switch your energy provider which is a lot easier than it sounds!Companies like  and  are energy suppliers.When you sign up, they work with your existing utility company to make sure all of the energy you use is supplied by clean energy sources.This doesn\u2019t cost anything extra for you and in fact, you\u2019ll probably see your electricity bill go down!If that doesn\u2019t match your needs, check into It\u2019s no secret that eating a plant-based diet is one of the easiest ways to have a positive impact on the environment.Making bread has become a favorite leisure activity in recent weekk so maybe you can pair that freshly made loaf with  or my favorite .Try adding a few more plant-heavy meals in your rotation. If you\u2019re looking for some inspo, the comment section  is overflowing with delicious recipes and meal ideas!When I switched to plant-based eating, the hardest part was breaking down my preconceived notions of what a \u201cmeal\u201d constitutes.Once I understood the building blocks of creating meals, I had total freedom to cook easy, inexpensive, and filling meals in under 30 minutes.I\u2019ll be hosting a workshop the first weekend in May to teach you exactly how to create this practice in your own life.If you\u2019re interested in learning the 5 Best Principles to easy, quick, and zero waste meals, . All of the details will be sent over next week!Have you thought about what your bank does with your money? Anything from CDs to savings accounts, banks invest your money and use it to give out loans.When I first heard that my money was being used to give people loans, I thought, \u201cCool! My money is being used to help someone buy a home or help someone open a small business in my town.\u201d Which isn\u2019t wrong, but it\u2019s just not the whole picture\u2026Banks also use that money to fund a lot of projects that you might not agree with like big Tobacco, the fossil fuel industry, tar sands pipelines, and the list goes on and on.For many of us, the most money we\u2019ll ever have in on place is our 401ks. Make sure that money is working for both you and the planet.You can get my full guide to .I first heard about Ecocide Law when I was researching ways for people to help with the  that were burning last fall.The goal of ecocide law is to add The Crime of Ecocide to The Rome Statute, known as Crime Against Peace, which is one of the most powerful documents in the world. Currently, the law makes four crimes punishable in International Criminal Court.The goal is to addso people who are knowingly destroying the environment, which endangers all of humanity through climate breakdown, can be taken to court. You can learn more and I would encourage you to !The average US household produces 650 lbs of organic trash a year, but most of that is landfilled.In fact, 60% of our landfills are full of organic matter because many people think their food scraps will return to the Earth, but they won\u2019t!Landfills are designed for storage \u2013 not decomposition.There\u2019s no oxygen in a landfill so organic matter can\u2019t break down creating a limbo state that releases methane. On average, methane is 30x more powerful than your average greenhouse gas like CO2.And, 16% of ALL methane emissions come from landfills.An easy way to fix this is to start composting, and as a bonus, you\u2019ll reduce your trash by at least 50% with this one swap.As you read that you probably thought, \u201cI\u2019d like to compost, but I just can\u2019t!\u201d So, before you make any decisions, I\u2019d love for you to do a bit more digging.Composting is WAYYYY easier than you think. I promise!It doesn\u2019t smell, it won\u2019t attract rodents, and there are literally 20+ different ways to do it so you\u2019re bound to find the perfect method for you.I\u2019ve gone ahead and separated them into two separate blog posts. If you have a backyard and you\u2019re feeling up for the challenge check out .If you live in an apartment or you\u2019re looking for something very, very low-maintenance check out  (even if you don\u2019t have a balcony).71% of the Earth\u2019s surface is covered in water, but only 3% of that is freshwater, and of that 3% most of it is locked under the Earth\u2019s surface, in ice, atmosphere, and soil.This leaves only .007% of the Earth\u2019s water available to fuel and feed its 6.8 billion people. ()As population rates climb this small percentage of water has to serve more people.On top of this, water is becoming more scarce due to climate change fueled droughts meaning there will be even less water to share among us.Average daily indoor water use in the US is around 60 gallons per person per day, but our virtual water use, in other words, how much water goes into the food we eat, the clothes we wear, and the products we use every day, is in the thousands of gallons.Don\u2019t believe me? Check out the\u00a0\u00a0\u2013 it\u2019s very eye-opening. The US Average is 2,220 Gallons/Day think you can beat it?My water footprint came to 1,262 Gallons/Day which is still a lot, and I would love to try and cut it down.4 simple ways you can shrink your water footprint today is:eat more plants!shop secondhand.choose reusables like cloth towels.choose products made from recycled materials.For more information and 6 more tips check out my blog post .If you have the means, I urge you to donate to a cause you believe in.I think  lays this out really well, \u201cIf you have a limited amount of time and money, it\u2019s more effective to donate that time and money toward nonprofits addressing environmental and systemic racism issues, than to stress yourself out trying to be perfect, or blow your budget on expensive fair trade clothing.\u201dDonating to organizations doing good work is easy and one of the MOST effective tools we can use.I have several recurring donations set up each month, and I donate a portion of every sponsorship I do. One of my goals this year is to create a more consistent donating schedule each month to benefit the organizations I love.When it comes to choosing an organization, it\u2019s always good to check them on . They rank charities for effectiveness and transparency.Here are a few of the charities I have recurring donations set up for and donated to last year:While you can\u2019t organize a community viewing of a documentary right now, you can definitely organize something virtually.Organize a  with your friends and look into streaming one of these eco-documentaries this Earth Day.our planetbefore the floodtrue costplastic oceanchasing coralriver bluebiggest little farmA lot of strikes have moved online from  to . Try joining in on one of these events! / Future for Fridays is doing a 24-hour live stream this week. I find their website a little clunky to navigate, but it appears that all you have to do to participate is tune into their YouTube channel! meet on the first Friday of every month and they\u2019re clearly have their reasons for striking listed on their channel:This week, in particular, there\u2019s also lot going on at . They have a huge roster and even have an online workshop dedicating to helping you divest.Try and pick one of these organizations to join and tune into their live stream.Did you know that planting trees is one of the easiest, cheapest and potentially most effective tools we have for combatting climate change and drawing down carbon from the atmosphere? ()Why not plant a tree this Earth Day?We could reverse the last 10 years of carbon emissions by simply planting 1 trillion trees.  is a non-profit organization, and they plant trees in North America, South America, Africa and Asia.Trees are vital parts of our eco-systems that help clean the air we breathe, filter the water we drink and provide habitat to over 80% of the world\u2019s terrestrial biodiversity.They also provide jobs to over 1.6 billion people, absorb harmful carbon from the atmosphere, and a key ingredient in more than 25% of all medicines.To make this even sweeter, it only costs $1 to plant a tree. That\u2019s right. $1!Hey, keyboard warrior. Crack your knuckles and get ready to work, because it\u2019s time to email your representatives.Your representative\u2019s job is to represent , and they can\u2019t do that if they don\u2019t know what\u2019s on your mind.It can feel overwhelming to reach out and cold email someone you\u2019ve never met, but don\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019m going to walk you through it step-by-step.My first recommendation is to check out your local Sierra Club Chapter.The Sierra Club does a good job of rounding up the current bills in your current legislative process, and the best way to find it is google, \u201cSierra Club Legislation in (Your State)\u201d, I looked up 10 different states and they all popped up within the first five results except for Alaska.To give you an example, here\u2019s\u00a0.\u00a0As you can see, everything is easy to read, and they tell you which bills to support or oppose so all you have to do is copy the bill number into an email or fax to your representative, and ask them to either oppose or support those bills.I highly recommend making this a monthly practice.Have a young kid at home? Or just feeling extra hands-on and in the need of testing a good hypothesis?Try one of these 3 easy sustainable science experiments from things you can probably find around your home. By recording what you throw away for a week, you\u2019ll have a better sense of where your food waste comes from, and then, be able to address how to decrease this misuse of nourishment.: learn how to regrow a vegetable from a scrap, monitor its vertical growth for 2 weeks and discuss the ecological importance of reducing food waste. We\u2019ve talked about what happens when food breaks down in a landfill \u2013 it releases methane gas. In this experiment, you can actually SEE the process!Check out all .Now is the perfect time to research a few groups and organizations you might want to join.Since everything is digital and not much is happening in person, it\u2019s the best time to get the feel for a new group and ways that you can get plugged in, in a very low-pressure environment.I\u2019ve gone ahead and listed a few organizations that you might be interested in joining.The The TheYour local  ChapterAnd, of course, you could also make plans to either  or think up a few new ideas to keep everyone inspired with sustainability.If you\u2019re looking for something a little different, be sure to check out my blog post .Have you ever calculated your carbon footprint?The quiz at  is my favorite one. You can pop over and plug-in the details of your life/last year, and then it will calculate how high your carbon footprint is including how many Earth\u2019s we\u2019d need to survive if everyone lived like you.Back when I lived in the tiny home, my carbon footprint was one earth. This was great because we have one earth, but now that we moved to a slightly bigger place Justin and are at about 1.3 earths.It can feel a little discouraging when you feel like you\u2019re doing a really good job, but still can\u2019t get seem to reach that one earth goal.In my blog post , I go over everything you need to know about offsetting your carbon footprint and why you should.I tell you what to look for, and how to choose a reliable organization to handle that for you.I challenge you to write to three different businesses and ask for them to make changes this week. I wrote a great post on , but it was very restaurant and packaging focused which might not be the best goal at this moment.Here are bulk bins are saran wrapped shut, we\u2019re not even allowed into the grocery store with reusable bags, and cafes suspended all in house dishwashing in lieu of disposables before we were ordered to shelter in place.I think those things will be totally appropriate to ask and write about when things start to normalize, but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s the best use of your time right now.Instead, I would like to turn your attention toweek. April 20, 2013 is when the Rana Plaza factory collapsed and killed 1,138 people and injured many more.The anniversary of the collapse is used to highlight the severe problems in the fast fashion industry. If you\u2019re looking for more information I highly recommend the documentary, which is under the documentary subheading) the True Cost.Fashion Revolution has done a great job setting up an easy to use template that will take you 10 seconds to email brands to demand more transparency in their supply chains. Here\u2019s the  where you can fill it out lickity-split.No matter what time of year it is, it\u2019s always a good idea to give these things a try. In fact, I even have a blog post that goes over  (even if it\u2019s over).I don\u2019t think that we should be supporting and thanking our planet only once a year, do you?After all, the Earth is pretty great! She gives us delicious tasting food, beautiful scenery, flowers, and so much more!If you\u2019re looking for a book recommendation that will completely reframe the way you see the world, I highly recommend  by Robin Wall Kimmerer.It\u2019s a beautiful love story to the Earth that completely changed my world view and my climate activism in 2017.I hope that you found this blog post helpful. I would love to know what you\u2019re going to be doing this Earth Day. Will you still be celebrating?Such a great list! If you don\u2019t mind adding another organization to your list, I currently volunteer for Extinction Rebellion in NYC  and we\u2019re always looking for new members. For earth week we\u2019re part of the Earth Week NYC coalition  but have a lot of big plans coming up for the summer and fall!May I add a tiny bit for teaching kids about waste management? We made a coloring book, available for free download, to teach kids how to separate waste and more. You can see it here, and if like, download: I took the challenge of planting trees and maintain a journal to track my habits and eliminate the ones that cause harm to the planet, wish me luck!Your email address will not be published.

If you\u2019ve been following along with me for a while then you know that I\u2019ve been working on the backend of my website for weeks. And, I mean\u2026 WEEEEEKS.I\u2019ve reformatted every single blog post (all 523 of them), updated the site, and I\u2019m optimizing GZW for speed. \u2018Cause I have a need for speed.Well, not  specifically but google. Google loves fast sites. Readers love fast sites. So a fast site you shall have. I\u2019m not done yet. I\u2019ve got to tweak things a bit and put on the bells and whistles, but I\u2019ve laid the foundation and done most of the heavy lifting which feels GREAT. Plus, this is the VERY first blog post I\u2019m writing since the updates. ** To celebrate and kick things off, I wanted to keep it simple by sharing 10 easy swaps you can make to have a zero waste kitchen.With my husband home all the time, we\u2019re going through more food and doing more dishes than ever before. I know that many of my friends and family are cooking up a storm! So, there\u2019s no better time to transition save money and reduce waste in the kitchen. Here are a few things you can leave behind.In 1997, Keurig launched its signature, single-use coffee pod known as a k-cup. Each pod is filled with either coffee, tea or hot chocolate. These machines arose in popularity because \u201cyou could brew just one cup!\u201dThe downside is that these machines are incredibly wasteful\u2026In 2015, Keurig produced 9.8 billion non-biodegradable K-Cups! If all of those cups were put end-to-end, they\u2019d circle the globe around 10.5 times.So, if you\u2019re looking for a way to get your coffee fix and still brew only *one* cup \u2013 well I\u2019ve got a treat for you.Introducing the french press. I use my\u00a0\u00a0single day and I LOVE it.Of course, you can brew more than one cup, but it\u2019s nice that you have the option of only brewing one too.You know I use my french press to make tea, but since my husband has been home, we\u2019ve been brewing a lot of coffee.I think using a is one of the most sustainable ways to brew coffee because there\u2019s no waste involved at all.There are no filters, no pods, just a good ol\u2019 fashioned perfect cup of coffee.One of the things I love about Bodum is that they offer spare parts so if your glass beaker breaks, (which has absolutely happened to me because I\u2019m a clutz) they !Now, that\u2019s a company that respects zero waste living!If you use the code you can get 10% off on your first purchase!I don\u2019t normally advocate for throwing out items and replacing them with \u201cnew\u201d fancy zero waste items.But, if you\u2019re still cooking with pans using Teflon I urge you to switch them out.Teflon was made using a chemical called\u00a0, or PFOA until 2015. The largest problem with PFOAs is that once it enters the environment it never leaves.According to the EPA, PFOA\u00a0can cause harm to reproductive, developmental, liver, kidney, and immunological systems.Instead, why not switch to something a bit more eco-friendly.I have a cast iron pan and a dutch oven, but my latest edition is a Green Pan and I\u2019m obsessed!I swore of non-stick pans years ago, but  swayed me because their coating is made with sand!Their pans with metal handles can go from stovetop to oven which is perfect if you have a more minimal kitchen. is made using recycled metals for the body of the pan \u2013 how cool is that?Their factory has solar panels, they have an amazing wastewater reclamation and recycling program, and their curing process results in 60% fewer CO2 emissions than their competitors.I have to say my  has quickly become my go-to whether I\u2019m saut\u00e9ing veggies or making pancakes.But really, it\u2019s been a DREAM making pancakes.  \u2060\u2800Remember in the last paragraph where I said, \u201cDon\u2019t throw out your old things to get new things!\u201dI firmly believe that you should hold onto your plastic Tupperware, but you might want to downgrade it from food storage.I personally use my plastic Tupperware for bits and bobs in the shed, bobby pins, hair ties, etc.Be sure to check out my blog post called that you might want to check out for more ideas!I try to avoid plastic Tupperware in my zero waste kitchen for health reasons, and instead, reach for my beloved glass food storage containers!You know that I\u2019m obsessed with my snapware and , but there are a few other types of glass food storage you might want to consider too.I have serious envy over the glass storage container with the bamboo lids, but my glass snapware is still working brilliantly!I\u2019ve always found plastic wrap to be quite frustrating. It just never seems to wrap the way I want it to\u2026 you know?Plastic wrap is made from Plastic #3, polyvinyl chloride also known as PVC.I try to avoid this is plastic because plasticizers and phthalates are added to make it softer and more pliable.Phthalates are endocrine disruptors that can interfere with our body\u2019s natural communication system.You can learn more about the seven types of plastic in my blog post Ditch this single-use material and opt for a safer alternative like silicone.I love these  because they work for small bowls, cups, jars, and cut vegetables.I often mix a few tablespoons of wet food in with Nala\u2019s kibble, and having a to secure the can is the perfect way to keep it fresh.These food huggers also work perfectly for preserving half-cut lemons, tomatoes, and even cucumbers.But, my all-time favorite thing is when I can\u2019t find the right lid to go with my upcycled jar these come in handy! They\u2019re taught enough that they\u2019re stackable in the fridge too.With the code  you can get $5.00 off on orders over $40.00.Did you know that tap water is more regulated than bottled water?Bottled Water\u00a0is\u00a0regulated\u00a0by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), while\u00a0tap water\u00a0is\u00a0regulated\u00a0by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) which has stricter and more transparent reporting.If you don\u2019t like the taste of your tap consider getting a filter and ditching the single-use bottles.For plastic-free options, I can recommend a kishu stick and the Berkey.Check out my blog post on  for more information.If you really like sparkling water and soda, consider getting a Soda Stream!I got a for my birthday last year, and I\u2019ve absolutely loved having fizzy water at the touch of a button.When I really want a treat, I like to add lemon juice, lime juice and a few sprigs of fresh mint!Did you know that you\u2019re supposed to throw your kitchen sponges out after two weeks!Instead of using sponges, I use compostable dish scrubbies! Here are some of my favorite swaps below:Be sure to check out this blog post if you want to MASTER.I used to buy a lot of aluminum foil, I used it for everything from lining pans to tenting pies and wrapping up that lone pizza slice.Thankfully there are reusable products when fill all of these voids.For that lone pizza or pie slice\u00a0do the trick! To shield your pie crust\u00a0.And, if you want something non-stick for baking check out\u00a0they also work great for freezing!If you wind up with any aluminum foil, it is recyclable. It\u2019s important that it\u2019s clean and dry and then roll it up into a ball that is at least 2\u2033 in diameter and you can throw it in you curbside bin.For more information on recycling, metals be sure to check out my blog post I ditched paper towels years ago and haven\u2019t looked back!Most people I meet are so hesitant to give up their paper towels and I\u2019m not sure why!This has been one of my all time favorite zero waste swaps and it will save you SO much money.I promise making this change is nowhere near as hard as you think it is.The secret is setting up a good system.I keep my clean towels in a drawer and throw dirty ones into the base of the washing machine so they\u2019re washed immediately with the next load of clothes.The next hurdle is to make sure that your towels absorb water rather than pushing it around.I\u2019ve tried several different types of towels, and I think that  do the best job.Check out my blog post  to get all of my tips on making this transition super simple.Before I went zero waste, I used a lot of ziploc bags.Growing up, I had the same lunch everyday. A PB&J wrapped in a plastic baggie, complete with a bag full of chips, a mini-gatorade, and a Little Debbie Cake.I cringe at the amount of trash I threw away everyday\u2026 but hey, on the bright side my school lunches were vegan and I didn\u2019t even know it!Right before I decided to go zero waste, I bought about 500 ziploc bags at Costco.I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever be able to go through all of them and wound up giving several boxes to friends and family members.My current solution to ziploc bags include:The most popular phrase you\u2019ll see on this blog is \u201cI hate food waste.\u201dAnd, that\u2019s because I really, really, really HATE food waste.40% of all the food in America is wasted, and there are several ways that we can work to combat this like storing your food properly, buying the right amount of food, and composting.I have tips on all of these which you can read in my blog post I can also recommend a few great books if you\u2019re looking into cooking with your scraps more. I hope that you found this post helpful. I would love to know what your favorite zero waste kitchen swaps are?Congratulations on finishing the reformat of all these great blog posts! That sounds like a lot of work. I\u2019m pinning this useful article because I know I\u2019ll want to check out these tips again later; learning about Green Pan and Food Huggers was especially helpful.Your email address will not be published.

Even when things look bleak, it\u2019s believing that together we can turn things around!On my instagram, , I run a series where I round up positive environmental news stories each week.I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t think positive news is controversial, but \u2013 oh, boy. I\u2019ve caught quite a bit of flack for seeing the glass half full and choosing to focus on positivity.A lot of people see that series as naive and harmful \u2013 yes, the word harmful has been used.They\u2019re afraid if people see positives, then they\u2019ll stop trying to make a difference or quit pushing for change.For me, it\u2019s just the opposite. When I read depressing climate news, I would feel sad and hopeless. It made me feel like giving up\u2026 like what I did, didn\u2019t matter at all.But after reading good news, it encouraged me to keep fighting and proved that my actions do, in fact, matter.\u00a0Focusing on the positive fills me with joy and makes me more productive.\u00a0These past few weeks have been stressful, and one of the main ways I\u2019ve been reducing stress is setting aside a little bit of time to pamper myself.One of the brands that\u2019s helping me do that, all while having a great impact on the environment is I\u2019ve been using their argan oil in my hair after showering and it\u2019s added an amazing shine. I\u2019m also loving their  and Josie Maran\u2019s argan oil comes from a UNESCO-protected region to help prevent deforestation and over-harvesting.A single argan tree can live for more than 600 years and produce fruit throughout its entire lifecycle!For every  through Sephora, they\u2019re donating $5 towards One Tree Planted, and on top of that they\u2019re doing a $10 give-back donation to first responders \u2013 which I think is amazing!Their whipped , whipped argan oil body butter and  are produced in facilities that utilize 77% renewable energy.Most of their products are sold in glass bottles and jars which are perfect for upcycling. But they take full responsibility over all of their packaging because Josie Maran is partnered with  to take back all of those empties.A few weeks ago, I was chatting with one of my friends about how I was feeling really down.I was in a general funk, and this friend, who happens to be a psychologist asked me a really important question\u2026\u201cWhat things do you do regularly that bring you joy?\u201dI kind a looked at her blankly because I couldn\u2019t think of a single thing!The only thing that came to mind was working. It was amazing to realize how much of my self-worth was tied up in my career and business.When things started to taper off (like they have for a lot of businesses during this time) I felt lost.Now was the time to start finding joy in other (healthier) places.So, I started a practice documenting five things that bring joy into everyday life.This should be a no-pressure exercise. These things don\u2019t have to be earth-shattering \u2013 heck, they don\u2019t even have to be different.If wearing your brings you joy today and tomorrow and the next day, take a mental note of it every day.As you\u2019re going throughout your day, find the small moments that bring you joy and happiness.Try it for a week, and if you notice things repeating, try and make time for those things especially on days when you\u2019re not feeling 100.I\u2019ve been doing this practice for over a month and it\u2019s been so eye-opening!I\u2019ve listed a few of my favorites below, but make sure to check out my YouTube video to see even more!I stopped celebrating a long time ago. Big or small, the celebrations ceased to focus on more \u201cproductive\u201d tasks.\u00a0Instead of feeling proud, I\u2019d jump straight into the next project and never give myself a second thought.One way I\u2019ve brought more joy and happiness into my life has been celebrating the small things.So whenever I do something I\u2019m proud of like putting up all of my laundry instead of letting it linger in the basket for five weeks, reformating all 600 of my blog posts, or finishing a chapter in my third book, I take a few moments to recognize the accomplishment and congratulate myself!For too long, I\u2019ve waited on recognition from others instead of giving it to myself.\u00a0Try it out this week! Allow yourself a moment or two to say, \u201cGood job!\u201d Pat yourself on the back, and allow yourself to enjoy that feeling of accomplishment.I\u2019m congratulating myself right now. Because damn girl. I\u2019m proud of you! Look at you. You\u2019re almost done writing this blog post and it\u2019s FABULOUS.This one should come as absolutely no surprise, but expressing gratitude is consistently associated with greater happiness.But, don\u2019t just take my word for it, here\u2019s .Practicing gratitude shifts your perspective and changes the way you interpret situations.It allows you to focus on the good instead of the bad, which will automatically help you have a better and happier day.When you get into a gracious mindset and intentionally start looking for the good, the easier it becomes to both find it and recognize it.Thankfully, it was pretty easy to find all of the good  doing when it comes to the planet!They have some ambitious goals, and are already on their way to achieving them! By next year:People ask me all the time, how I continue to stay positive even when the outcome seems bleak, and the answer is simple.I am an optimist because I  to be optimistic. I\u2019m not just finding joy in life, I\u2019m actively looking for it.While some of us might be natural-born optimists, most of us have to train ourselves to seek out the good.I used to dwell on a lot of negative emotions like sadness, jealousy, and anger, but everything shifted when I heard this Buddha quote, \u201cHolding onto anger is like drinking poison and waiting for the other person to die.\u201dAll of the negative emotions I had bottled up weren\u2019t solving my problems, and the only person I was hurting was myself.I honestly thought, if I worried enough or were upset enough or if I CARED enough then I could solve the world\u2019s problems, but it\u2019s just not true. You don\u2019t have to feel bad every day to prove that you care.Lastly, I\u2019ve been finding joy in the slow and small moments. Being busy is overrated.Worrying is one of my brain\u2019s ways of feeling productive and active during \u2018downtime\u2019 (you can read more about that here) because I\u2019ve become so tied to the idea that my worth = my productivity.Logically, I know that\u2019s false, but it\u2019s going to take time for my subconscious to catch up.Slowing down encompasses so many of the things we\u2019ve already talked about in this post.It\u2019s about taking time to celebrate the small things, focusing on what brings you joy, and taking a deep breath to focus on the present world.It\u2019s amazing how shallow I breathe when I\u2019m not paying attention or living in the moment, but when I take a deep breath it\u2019s so much easier to bring myself back into the present moment.So when my mind starts to wander into the future or thinking about what comes next, I just take a minute to slow down and focus on the task that\u2019s right in front of me whether that\u2019s doing the dishes, watching a movie with Justin or getting ready for the day and putting on my .I would like to thank  for sponsoring this postIf you\u2019d like snap up a bottle of their beloved , I want to remind you that they\u2019re donating $5 towards One Tree Planted, and offering a $10 give-back donation to first responders this month!I just stumbled across your blog today (a day late for Earth day) and wanted to give thanks for your blog and all the information you share on being a good steward to our earth.

Food waste might seem like something small, but it adds up to a massive\u2026 and I mean MASSIVE impact.If food waste were a country, it would be the third largest emitter of greenhouse gasses behind the US and China.Obviously, not all food waste is the consumer\u2019s fault as a lot of this responsibility falls to the manufacturers. When talking about food waste we can talk about it in two different terms. According to , \u201c\u00a0is \u201cthe decrease in edible food mass throughout the part of the supply chain that specifically leads to edible food for human consumption\u201d, including the production, post harvest and processing stages. is food loss that occurs \u201cat the end of the\u00a0\u201d, i.e. during retail or final consumption.\u201dWhile there\u2019s a not a ton we can do about food loss, there\u2019s A LOT we can do to mitigate food waste. In this blog post, I\u2019m going to go over 10 things you can do to reduce food waste. But, I also want to shine a light on a few of the issues we experience with food loss. Especially my favorite and most infuriating  \u2013 don\u2019t I sound like a joy to invite over to parties?Our food has Yep.It\u2019s not just magazine covers that are projecting unrealistic and unattainable versions of beauty \u2013 we do it to our produce too.For instance, peppers have to stand. If a pepper is too long or has a strange crease that prevents it from standing up straight, it\u2019s rejected.There\u2019s an infuriating video from War on Waste, where bananas that are slightly too big or too small are just thrown away. Bonkers, right!?That\u2019s just one of many food loss problems, but let\u2019s not spend too much time what we can\u2019t fix and focus on what we can!How often do you go to the grocery store without checking what you already have in your fridge first?\u00a0Sit down and take five minutes to make a quick meal plan. You can check out my blog post on .Don\u2019t worry. I hate meal planning too.This isn\u2019t your normal type of meal planning \u2013 it\u2019s!This isn\u2019t a meal plan where you write down everything you\u2019ll eat Monday-Friday, it\u2019s more of a road map to ensure you don\u2019t waste food.I\u2019m just asking you to open up your fridge and your freezer and look at your pantry before you go grocery shopping.If you open up the fridge and say \u201chey, I\u2019ve got a tomato, a couple carrots and some broccoli that needs to be eaten\u201d, then you can think of a meal or two for the beginning of the week where you can use those up.You also know now that you don\u2019t need to buy tomato, carrots or broccoli which prevents you from buying duplicate items.I have a tendency to buy more food than I need. Anyone else?I somehow always overestimate the food I\u2019m going to eat and buy enough for 1-2 extra meals. Then I feel guilty because the produce is starting to wilt, and I\u2019ve got to find a way to creatively eat it or preserve it.Thankfully, I\u2019ve gotten a lot better about this. When I\u2019m at the grocery store I try to put back 15% of my cart.I really try to examine what I actually need because if I do run out of something I can always pop back to the store.If you\u2019re reading this blog post the month it came out, I don\u2019t really follow this advice since food shortages have been common, and I\u2019m trying to avoid going to the grocery store frequently.I\u2019m not hoarding food by any stretch of the imagination, but I am buying a little extra food.One of my favorite ways to preserve foods is to use my freezer! You can get all my tips in the post If you\u2019re reading this blog post a year or two in the future, then I think this advice absolutely applies!Once you get home from the store, you\u2019re going to want to make sure that you\u2019re storing your foods properly!This is KEY to making your fruits and vegetables last as long as possible! Be sure to check out myI am going to be updating that blog post to make it easier to read and even more robust covering all different types of fruits and veg!You can pretty much ignore the \u201cbest by, sell by and use by\u201d expiration dates. Think about it, it\u2019s impossible for a manufactuerer to know the EXACT day something is going to go bad.I think the funniest example of this is honey.Honey has an expiration date on it which is laughable because honey found from ancient Egypt, 1,000s of years ago is still perfectly fine to eat.Besides, conditions change in everyone\u2019s home between humidity, temperature, sunlight, etc. so the producers of many of these products just make an educated guess.Things could easily go bad before or after that date. The only real way to tell is using your best judgement. Does it look bad, smell bad or taste bad? If so, it\u2019s probably bad \u2013 the date has nothing to do with it.Here\u2019s what those labels really mean:See? Definitely not as scary as you thought! And, no reason to throw something in the trash just because it said it went \u201cbad\u201d yesterday.If there\u2019s something on your plate you can\u2019t finish, don\u2019t be shy to ask a family member if they want it instead.If not, save it for later instead of throwing it away.The same goes for eating out: If there\u2019s food you can\u2019t finish on your plate, be sure to take it home!I like to bring a  with me when I know I\u2019ll be dining out, just in case I have leftovers.Check out my blog post  for a full guide on how to save leftovers! on When I get home from the grocery store I like to spend a few minutes prepping my fruit and vegetables.This is one of the secrets to getting easy plant-based meals on the table F-A-S-T. For more tips you should check out my blog post Plant Based, Zero Waste: What I Eat in a Day.There\u2019s just something about getting things chopped and ready for snacking or ready to throw into a pan makes me 95% more likely to actually eat the food I bought from the grocery store than cave and go out to a restaurant. (or worse \u2013 order takeout!)To be perfectly honest with you, if something has a few specks of mold on it like a bell pepper or tomato \u2013 I\u2019m still going to eat it.I cut the black spots off, and eat the rest of the fruit or vegetable.I don\u2019t have any problem doing this, and I\u2019ve never gotten sick. I\u2019m telling you this so you know how I think, but upfront I\u2019m not a doctor so you should use your best judgement.When my produce starts to shrivel or gets a few black spots I do try to cook it on high heat to help kill anything off.I think the moral of the story is similar to the one from expiration dates \u2013 just use your best judgement!Another great way to reduce food waste is to cook with your scraps.There are so many parts of a vegetable that often get thrown out but are perfectly edible, like carrot tops and broccoli stems. Carrot tops can become pesto and broccoli stems can become slaw.Here are a few other ways to cook with scraps:For more ideas and recipes, check out my book\u00a0!Did you know many of the foods you buy from the grocery store can be regrown?You can grow lemons from lemon seeds, and a mini-tree from an avocado seed.  But, I don\u2019t think either will bear fruit.I\u2019ve had success growing things lettuce, celery, green onions and more! You can check out my blog post One of my favorite things to grow is green onions. When start regrowing your scraps, it\u2019s best to start with a cup of water.Place the stalk of your romaine or the ends of your onions in the cup of water and change it every every day or every other day.The cup doesn\u2019t have to be completely full. You just need enough water for the base of the plant to be covered by an inch.The scraps will start to regrow and once the roots sprout, you can transfer to a pot of soil.Just make sure the pot has drainage! If it doesn\u2019t, your plants will probably die. I learned this the hard way\u2026.The average US household produces 650 lbs of organic trash a year, but most of that is landfilled.In fact, 60% of our landfills are full of organic matter because many people think their food scraps will return to the Earth, but they won\u2019t!Landfills are designed for storage \u2013 not decomposition.There\u2019s no oxygen in a landfill so organic matter can\u2019t break down creating a limbo state that releases methane. On average, methane is 30x more powerful than your average greenhouse gas like CO2.And, 16% of ALL methane emissions come from landfills.An easy way to fix this is to start composting, and as a bonus, you\u2019ll reduce your trash by at least 50% with this one swap.As you read that you probably thought, \u201cI\u2019d like to compost, but I just can\u2019t!\u201d So, before you make any decisions, I\u2019d love for you to do a bit more digging.Composting is WAYYYY easier than you think. I promise!It doesn\u2019t smell, it won\u2019t attract rodents, and there are literally 20+ different ways to do it so you\u2019re bound to find the perfect method for you.I\u2019ve gone ahead and separated them into two separate blog posts. If you have a backyard and you\u2019re feeling up for the challenge check out\u00a0.If you live in an apartment or you\u2019re looking for something very, very low-maintenance check out\u00a0\u00a0(even if you don\u2019t have a balcony).Your email address will not be published.

However, I completely understand wanting to ditch plastic around your food for health reasons.\u00a0I would highly recommend that you remove the plastic that touches your food. That doesn\u2019t mean that you have to completely get rid of your plastic Tupperware though. Instead, I would focus on a way to repurpose them.You can use plastic tupperware in so many places that don\u2019t involve holding food. I didn\u2019t get rid of my plastic tupperware when I went plastic-free and I didn\u2019t get rid of it when I went zero waste. Here\u2019s how I still use it around the home.\u00a0I keep a compost bucket in my freezer both at home and at work. I use large old tupperware containers to hold it and transport it to my .\u00a0I brought several of my tupperware containers to work for the kitchen. They often get used for leftovers and people take them home.\u00a0We use several of our old tupperware containers in the garage where they hold all sorts of odds and ends. They can be used in the bathroom to hold bobby pins and hair ties. I even have two that hold jewelry in the bedroom.\u00a0Don\u2019t foget about the junk drawer too. Yes, I still have a junk drawer to hold important do-dads like batteries, wires, and miscellaneous office supplies. I use a small container to hold expired batteries, so I can take all of them at once down to the battery recycling box at best buy.\u00a0On top of all of this, there\u2019s still a lot of plastic in my life in general.\u00a0I don\u2019t think plastic is horrible. I think plastic is very important and without it, we would not have made the strides we have in science and in medicine.\u00a0Plastic has a place. Plastic belongs in our society, but it does not belong to supplement our laziness.\u00a0Plastic will never go away. Every piece of plastic ever created still exists. It\u2019s important that we remember that and treat it as such. It has its place, but single-use disposable items are not one of them.I think it\u2019s best to use the plastic items already in my life until they break or are no longer useable. If it\u2019s not around my food, then I don\u2019t view it as a huge health concern.\u00a0When I went plastic-free for , I had a lot of single-use plastic disposable items in my kitchen like plastic baggies.\u00a0I did give those away to friends who would have bought them anyways. I didn\u2019t hold onto and use everything up. Somethings I did part ways with. But, here are a couple of the plastic items still in my life.\u00a0I use this plastic bucket into catch water. I use it to haul the water out to the garden. I use it for mopping, and I hand wash delicates in it too.\u00a0I have had six large plastic laundry tubs that have traveled with me for over 10 years. They\u2019ve always managed to store lots of stuff. They\u2019re stackable which makes them really convenient for hauling items during a move.\u00a0Especially since we\u2019ve moved (6 times in the last 4 years.)\u00a0I have several of these under the bed, under sinks, and in the closet. I\u2019ve had a lot of these travel with me all over the country.\u00a0Once this one goes, I\u2019m pretty excited about upgrading to one of the cool bamboo toilet brushes.\u00a0I am currently typing this on a plastic computer. I have a plastic tv with a plastic PlayStation and plastic controllers. Plastic is still a part of my life and that\u2019s OK.\u00a0This one is probably a shocker, but I have a set of melamine plates in my picnic basket. I use them for outdoor parties, camping, and occasionally a picnic.\u00a0My goal in going plastic free is first and foremost for health reasons. My second goal has always been to reduce my consumption of plastic to rely less on the oil industry and to vote with my dollars.\u00a0It doesn\u2019t mean plastic is going to magically disappear from my life. It\u2019s about being a conscious consumer and being mindful of my choices.\u00a0Each choice we make has an impact. We get to choose what that impact is and what it says. Each purchase is a vote for the future you want to live in.\u00a0What plastic pieces do you still have in your home?\u00a0I\u2019m a plastic freak and it has many uses, containers for all kinds of items. When plastic discolors, never use to store food, recycle it or use it for the garage or other storage..Like you I try to re-purpose plastic as my first choice but know that some will have to go to landfill. However replacing those items with plastic free ones is immensely satisfying. Popping by from Zero Waste Heroes!Welcome! Yes, I agree. I do feel super snazzy breaking out my metal tiffin. \ud83d\ude42I agree. I\u2019m definitely new to zero waste, but I\u2019ve had my heart set on changing for a while. I hope to keep some use out of my plastic items, but have since repurposed them for storage etc. I am an artist so I had a lot of plastic palettes and supplies. With good care, these items could potentially last a very long time. I will switch to glass or metals later, but for now it would be contrary to my new lifestyle to just throw them away! I do have an itch to just get rid of them, because the more sustainable options are so cute and practical, not to mention that spending money on things you WON\u2019T throw away is super satisfying.Even living a zero waste lifestyle we\u2019re susceptible to branding and marketing. If you only had this item, your home would be picture perfect! I feel this soooooo much especially in the age of instagram. But, it sounds like you\u2019re fighting the urge well! And, I\u2019m super excited for you to upgrade once your plastic ones break down. \ud83d\ude09I\u2019m trying to go plastic free but I struggle with the medicine cabinet. I\u2019m not into herbal medicine, and I have a need to take prescriptions. I can\u2019t and won\u2019t give that up for me or my family (there\u2019s no point going plasticless for health reasons if I die from not taking medications, right?). But even over the counter medicines like allergy pills, Neosporin, rubbing alcohol, hydrogen peroxide\u2026 there\u2019s just no way around plastic. Which makes me wonder how things were dispensed in the old days before plastic. Was everything in glass? I guess there apothecaries instead of CVS, but that\u2019s not really an option any more. Suggestions on any plastic alternatives here?Your health ALWAYS comes first. I have a post called what I still buy in packaging and you just listed 50% of the list. Allergy pills, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide. I think it\u2019s OK not to be perfect. Just do the best you can. We don\u2019t live in an ideal circular economy, which means not everything is going to be attainable package free.Another way that I\u2019ve seen to recycle pill bottles is through a Methodist church online who sends them to developing countries in need of sterile medication bottles. Not sure if that is something you would be interested in, but I always thought it was an interesting idea. There is the link that I found: Our local animal shelter takes in pill bottles that they reuse for pill storage for the animals. We keep a bin in our breakroom at work and, every few months, someone will drop the bottles off at the shelter. It\u2019s not necessarily a plastic alternative, but it does give the bottles another use or two.I also have to take prescription meds. I use the old bottles to hold seeds for my garden and small items like screws, nails and dried herbs.Schools love old Tupperware, biscuit and sweet tins for students to take any home Home Ed/Food Tech offerings likely to make it to the school bus!Also any small pots that would hold paint or glue.We\u2019re gradually transitioning, so we still have a LOT of plastic stuff in the kitchen.Question: what do you use instead of plastic for BIG bulk food storage e.g. rice bought by the 10 kg bag etc? We live in a damp climate so keeping it in its original sack is not an option.I have a giant tin from a fundraiser that years ago some organization was doing, selling flavored popcorn. It holds at least 10 pounds of rice, which is how I use it. Sometimes you can find such tins at yard sales or thrift stores. That might work.Lee, we are just starting this transition as well and I have gone to glass gallon mason jars and for leftovers I use glass containers with seal tight lids.We recycle plastic bags, all plastic containers, bread clips, plastic/metal hangers, Styrofoam of any color, paper,cardboard, tin, non working electrical appliances,electronics, any metal\u2026\u2026anything we use that comes with packaging is separated and recycled accordingly! We compost organic material and manage to fill a standard garbage can once every 2 months! It can be done but you need to make the effort and also to think before you buy too!I want to thank you for your honesty and transparency. I just started researching zero waste, in conjunction with sustainability. As I look around my home, it can be overwhelming seeing the amount of plastic accumulated over the years (especially with children). And then I have to think that this didn\u2019t happen over night, so living zero waste isn\u2019t going to happen over night. I am greatly encouraged to teach our children about zero waste and learn together how to change our health and want for convenience.I being a pensioner could not afford to throw out my tupperwear which iv had for over 20 years.ill still use it.BUT i hate extra plastick wrapping on fruit and veggies and thats what i wont have.i take it all off when i get to my car and leave it in the trolly\u2026.i did not ask for it and the supermarkets can dispose if it.There is an easier way, don\u2019t buy your fruit and veggies in plastic. I buy mine loose and use a produce bag or take my own paper bags. Leaving it for the supermarket to dispose of it is dumping your responsibility onto someone else.Zero waste means zero single use plastic, not no plastic. So many online seem to ditch their plastic when they go zero waste. Plastic free is great but that is a different goal. I have gotten rid of none of my Tupperware and plan to keep it forever. I already only used glass for microwaving, plates, etc. and metal utensils. I try not to buy any new plastic now, but what I have already won\u2019t become less wasteful elsewhere and I might as well be the one to use it if it is already here.I am lucky that it is easy for me to get fresh produce in my supermarket that is not prewrapped like what seems to be the case in some other places. I have never seen plastic wrapped bananas here, rarely apples, and only some cucumbers so easy to avoid. I got some fish today, and asked for no plastic (usually a small piece to line the paper package and then a zip lock bag over the paper. The woman looked at me like I was nuts but she did just wrap it butcher paper.What about baggies? Do you use them still?Excellent article! What should I do with the plastic straws still in my life? That I never used!My big issue is how to wrap my meat for the freezer!! I cook for one the majority of the time and wrap my meat in meal size portions in Glad/Saran Wrap to store. I have made wax wraps and fruit and vege bags as well as sandwich/snack bags,I have made fabric bowl covers for the fridge and to transport food but have not found a solution for this. Any ideas would be gratfully appreciatedI use greaseproof paper. You will find it in the shops right next to the cling wrap.Pyrex glass containers?You can compost in the plastic tub if you have a container garden or a general garden. Poke holes in the lid and bottom of it, fill it like a regular compost pile, water it, and sit it with your plants. It\u2019ll actually feed your plants for you. It\u2019s very versatile way to compost.Truly informative and helpful blog. Thanks for sharing. I am working towards reducing!Your email address will not be published.

I get so many people asking me, what are the next steps after tackling?\u00a0Living a zero waste lifestyle, isn\u2019t like moving through a timeline. It\u2019s more of a choose your own adventure. Which is a pretty vague answer.\u00a0I\u2019ve come up with an outline of a step-by-step zero waste process, but it by no means has to go in this order. You can go in any direction you like, but for some that are struggling with next steps, I hope this helps!\u00a0The first step is being aware of the problem. If you\u2019re on my blog, I\u2019m assuming that you\u2019re aware of the problem. Long story short \u2013 we make too much trash.\u00a0Check out this post about  and this one about the .\u00a0This is all about using what you already have. If you\u2019re anything like me, when I started going zero waste I had backups of lots of personal care items.I had a lot of paper towels, napkins, tissues, and other single-use disposable items.\u00a0I had a pantry full of food, some of which was regularly passed over for more desirable items.I had a lot of things that weren\u2019t being used or serving a purpose in my life. I started to phase those items out.I started using what I had, instead of purchasing new. I intentionally planned meals to use up the odd items in the pantry with a vow to make better purchases in the future.\u00a0For more information on what to do with your old plastic when you\u2019re going plastic free, check out .\u00a0As you\u2019re phasing out old items, look to replace some of them with reusable items. The first place I tell everyone to start with is .\u00a0When looking to purchase reusable items, make sure to check the second hand market first! But, most importantly make sure that what you\u2019re buying is going to last you for a very long time.\u00a0I\u2019m always amazed that for every d.Make sure you\u2019re making a good purchase that you\u2019re 100% satisfied with.Don\u2019t buy something immediately. Take some time and think about it so you make the best purchase possible. When ever making a purchase, I always reference to make sure I\u2019m not adding unecessary clutter to my life.\u00a0The hardest part about transitioning to a zero waste lifestyle was having patience! You\u2019re not going to go zero waste in a week!\u00a0There can be this urge to throw everything out and start completely over, but that\u2019s contradictory to the lifestyle. The lifestyle says waste nothing!\u00a0Use what you have to start. To be honest with you, almost three years later and I STILL have things from my pre-zero waste life. I plan on using those things until I can use them no longer.\u00a0Zero wasters may look like they have it 100% picture perfect together, but we all started somewhere. In fact, take a look at me in \u00a0Once simple swaps have become routine, it\u2019s time to take things one step further. Take a look at what you\u2019re still throwing away and recycling.\u00a0 Start trying to find solutions for these items.\u00a0This is where you get to have fun! It\u2019s time to think outside the box and try something new. You can always try something new.If you don\u2019t like it, you don\u2019t have to keep doing it. I have. It\u2019s equally important to ecological sustainability.\u00a0When I first started going zero waste, I made my own tortillas.\u00a0If you\u2019ve been following this blog for any period in time, you know how that went. Other than, \u201cI HATE food waste,\u201d the most popular words you\u2019ll find on this blog is, \u201cI HATE making tortillas.\u201d\u00a0It was time for me to find a better solution.\u00a0I hopped on down to a local Mexican restaurant and loaded up on tortillas in my own bag. Since then, I\u2019ve found a tortilleria where I can get 20 freshly made tortillas in my own bag or $2. That\u2019s right. $2.\u00a0Sometimes, it\u2019s just about finding a better solution.\u00a0Going zero waste really is a journey. When, I started this lifestyle, I knew I wanted to avoid making trash and bringing plastic into my home.\u00a0Over the years, I\u2019ve learned so many new things. I\u2019ve learned about the dangers of . I learned more about the environmental impacts of a .I\u2019ve learned about the devastating effects of  and that we waste an.I\u2019m constantly evolving, learning, and growing. Each day I learn something new, and I learn how to do better.\u00a0No one is perfect, hence the motto of my blog, \u201cIt\u2019s not about perfection; it\u2019s about making better choices.\u201dBut, every day we have the choice to leave a positive impact on the planet, and I\u2019m just doing the best I can to make positive choices.\u00a0Keep educating yourself. Constantly keep learning and ask yourself, \u201cIs there something I can do better?\u201d Maybe the answer is no, but maybe the answer is yes!\u00a0Keep checking in with yourself. Always strive for better.\u00a0You\u2019re definitely going to notice your consumer habits changing.\u00a0The best piece of advice I can offer is to stop purchasing things for a while (not food obviously). You can take some time to examine what you need.\u00a0I stopped buying things and focused on what I already had. I started finding contentment and it was really liberating.\u00a0Stuff doesn\u2019t define us. Life isn\u2019t about acquiring more things.\u00a0Living a zero waste lifestyle has taught me about what\u2019s really important: time and relationships.\u00a0When I did really need something, I started looking at the second hand market first.Then I looked for an ethical place to make a purchase. All of the things I bring into my life are very carefully curated and bring a lot of value to my life.\u00a0It\u2019s important to get involved in your supply chain. Know where your purchases are coming from and know what\u2019s going to happen to them when you\u2019re done with them.\u00a0The concept of voting with your dollars is really popular in the zero waste movement.\u00a0Every purchase you make is a vote for the kind of world you want to live in. Make sure your purchases are supporting your values and ideal world.\u00a0It\u2019s difficult to become discouraged when you feel like you\u2019re the only one out there trying to make a difference.\u00a0I promise, you\u2019re not alone in this fight! There are a ton of people working towards a common goal. Check out this blog post with .I even have my own \u201ctop-secret\u201d zero waste group. You can join us by signing up !\u00a0Once you feel like you\u2019ve got the individual action step down, it\u2019s time to go one step further. With your local zero waste community, it\u2019s time to pick out certain businesses you\u2019d like to target.\u00a0Maybe there\u2019s a restaurant you frequent and they put straws in your drink automatically.Write a letter with your group asking that the owner instate a new policy. Instead of automatically placing a straw in everyone\u2019s drink, make straws available by request only.\u00a0Organize a documentary viewing for the local community. Host a talk at the library. Get a booth at the farmers market. Host an earth day event. Talk to teachers so they can start .\u00a0Encourage your  with some initiatives.\u00a0Start thinking about community action to help get others involved and grow the movement at the grassroots level.\u00a0One of the best quotes I\u2019ve heard, \u201cCitizens and businesses must first act so policy can react.\u201d Policy reflects the will of the citizens and local businesses. By fostering a green community and gathering like-minded individuals, you\u2019ll have some serious power to negotiate with your local government.\u00a0For more information on getting involved with your local government check out .\u00a0My journey looks very similar to the one presented here. I hit step 10 earlier this year when chosen to serve my local government. I\u2019m curious if your journey looked like this?\u00a0Have you gone through all the steps? Were they in a similar order? What step are you on now?\u00a0Loved this post. Sometimes zero waste feels like a game and you just want to win, so wasting anything feels unpleasant. So having stuff you\u2019re still going through (like lotion or the last tube of toothpaste we had in stock) feels like it\u2019s taking forever to get through it all. It\u2019s been trial and error with finding alternatives that have worked with my family to reduce our waste. My husband has only started to get into it. Using his own cup to get a softdrink at the gas station or bringing his own bag to the store or asking the cashier not to bag his items if he forgets his bags. Just like the toothpaste, we still were working our way through our toothbrushes. But they are ready for a change and he told me we needed bamboo toothbrushes. I just keep thinking that our home reducing our waste doesnt have a big impact, but maybe someone else stuck in traffic with me is doing the same things, and someone else next to them is doing something too.

Buying something new is pretty low on the totem pole.\u00a0As the green movement flourishes,\u00a0marketers are going to try and capitalize on it. They are going to try and sell you \u201cgreen\u201d products that you absolutely \u201c\u201cWhile you might need this item and it might make your life easier, it\u2019s definitely worth spending some time and thinking about it.I made a great  to help you make smart purchasing decisions.\u00a0Similarly, make sure you\u2019re not being .\u00a0I have nothing against buying items that will truly improve your quality of life! These items are different for everyone.One of my purchases was a potato masher. Could I use a fork? Yeah, but it made me miserable.\u00a0I bought a potato masher and magically mashed potatoes were a treat again.Every time I see my potato masher, I am filled with joy! This is how all purchases should make you feel.\u00a0You should feel overjoyed at the sight of that object because it improved the quality of your life.\u00a0When going zero waste, you\u2019re probably going to be .\u00a0You also might be looking to swap out consumable items for non-plastic alternatives like , , , , you name it.\u00a0When it comes to consumables, you\u2019re almost always going to buy those new. Sometimes, a friend might have bought a shade of lipstick she doesn\u2019t like and offer it to you.But, nine times out of ten, you\u2019re going to be buying those things new.\u00a0The smartest thing to do is ask your friends! Most people have too much stuff. They tend to have duplicate items they never use.While your friends might not have an extra bidet attachment lying around their house, they might have extra mason jars, cooking utensils, pots and pans, or an extra water bottle. You really never know until you ask.I\u2019ve gotten several of my zero waste items from estate sales. Things are not made like they used to be.The older generation tends to have very high-quality zero waste friendly items, simply because they lived life before plastic.\u00a0They\u2019re also sold relatively inexpensively. Things I would look for at an estate sale.\u00a0I bought a whole bunch of handkerchiefs at an estate sale for a quarter a piece. Just make sure to wash them with really hot water.\u00a0While I wouldn\u2019t classify this as a zero waste necessity, it is a great place to find very well made products that will be easier to repair.Hand made quilts, crocheted blankets, place mats, table runners, I\u2019ve bought them all at estate sales. They\u2019re a great price and very sturdy.\u00a0I\u2019ve picked up a pan that just needed a little seasoning. It\u2019s always worth looking!\u00a0I inherited my tea strainers from my great grandmother, but I can only assume that they would be fairly common at estate sales.\u00a0Look for larger weaves that absorb water instead of push it around.I also inherited some tea towels from my great grandmother which do a pretty good job of absorbing water. I also have a set from  that do well too.\u00a0I have two orange Le Creuset pots that are vintage and I love them! I got them for a total steal, and I use them almost every day.\u00a0I\u2019ve picked up several very sturdy tools from estate sales from hammers to wrenches.I\u2019ve also picked up several wooden and metal crates! Not related to zero waste at all, but super attractive additions to my home without the hefty price tag from pottery barn. Plus, they weren\u2019t manufactured in China either.\u00a0Not entirely related to zero waste supplies, but it is a great place to find really well made furniture that can easily be repaired.\u00a0 Vintage jars here you come! Estate sales are a great place to stock up on plenty of Ball jars. All of your zero waste pantry dreams can come true.They tend to sell for pretty cheap, and I also see lots of one gallon pickle jars. They\u2019re perfect for storing things like flour or other items you use often.You might be able to find an old school safety razor. Not much has changed in the world of safety razors.You can still find blades for them, and they\u2019re easy to take apart and clean. Rinse with really hot soapy water. You might even find a vintage blade bank too.\u00a0You will be able to find many of the same types of items at antique stores and thrift stores, although I have noticed the prices to be slightly in higher in most cases.\u00a0I found a lot of my mason jars at thrift stores as well as several Klean Kanteens. Could not beat the price of a $1 water bottle!\u00a0It\u2019s always worth a look because you never know what you\u2019re going to find.\u00a0I had a lot of trouble finding any sort of metal tiffins second hand. While metal lunch boxes certainly aren\u2019t necessary, they are a lot lighter than carrying around their glass counter parts.It\u2019s also difficult to shove a sandwich in a mason jar.\u00a0I\u2019ve done it, but it just doesn\u2019t feel as practical.\u00a0Checking eBay is a great way to find some second hand items. While it\u2019s always preferable to buy second hand in person, it\u2019s another great option for hard to find items.\u00a0Look for companies and people you trust. I\u2019m really impressed with the offerings of in Boulder.  is always a good place to shop and  offers a pretty good selection too.\u00a0If you have a health food store near you or a co-op they might have some zero waste supplies too! I\u2019ve even found safety razors and menstrual cups at Target.\u00a0So, always take a look around town, you never know what you might find!I think I\u2019d rather support a small business that offers sustainable products than a corporate giant like target. But, on the other hand, it\u2019s great to let places like that know there\u2019s a demand for sustainable products.\u00a0I see value in both sides. What do you think?Loved this \ud83d\ude42Thanks friend!Thanks for the tips! I\u2019ve never really been big on social media for things other than family and friends, but thought I\u2019d join a few groups on Facebook and are finding them fabulous!I\u2019m so glad!hi\u2026am from north east india ..new to Pinterest but an ardent follower of all things reusable & trying to live a life that\u2019s simple..found this tonite & am excited.Thanks for the tips! I always appreciate your thought out and very concise posts. Definitely my favorite zero waste blogger!You should consider adding the website  to your list. It\u2019s a website similar to Craigslist except everything is free! It\u2019s intended to avoid perfectly to good items going to the landfill. So you can post offers of things you\u2019d like to get rid of or post wanted ads for things you are looking for.

{"url": "https://goingzerowaste.com/blog/how-to-go-zero-waste-on-a-budget-fifty-dollars-or-less/", "title": "HowtoGoZeroWasteonaBudgetGoingZeroWaste", "body": "I have been zero waste for almost three years now. I have picked up so much information along the way and found the best tools for me.\u00a0Every zero waster is going to have different things that that make their lives easier. It will take time to figure out what those things are for you.\u00a0I have saved SO much money since going zero waste, which has allowed me the opportunity to experiment with different items.I also write a popular blog, which has given me a platform to test new items. This means companies send items to me for free in hopes that I will write about them. Very few make it to the blog, but I just want to make sure you know that it is a privilege I have now.\u00a0When I first started going zero waste in 2015, I was completely broke. I didn\u2019t have a blogging platform. I didn\u2019t have really any disposable income, but going zero waste was important to me.\u00a0I decided that all I could invest in going zero waste was $50. I\u2019m going to tell you what I bought, and how I would have handled it hindsight.\u00a0Of course, I still realize having a spare $50 is not a luxury everyone has. But, I do hope this helps people who are looking to go zero waste on a budget!It doesn\u2019t have to be a super expensive endeavor. You don\u2019t have to have fancy metal lunch boxes or shop at specialty zero waste stores.\u00a0A lot of the fancy zero waste items I have, have been gifts over the years birthdays, Christmas, and of course gifts from companies. But, I just wanted to give you a glimpse of where I started\u2026\u00a0I went to the thrift store to buy pillow cases to stitch into produce bags. I picked up two large pillow cases for $2.I figured pillow cases would be a good place to start since they would have a couple of sides finished for me.\u00a0I cut my pillow cases into six bags, and hand stitched the edges. I do not have a sewing machine, but I am pretty handy with a needle.\u00a0I only bag produce that is small and needs to stay together like lettuce or mushrooms. This prevented me from needing lots of bags. It was rather limiting when going to the bulk store, but I did have a hefty selection of mason jars.\u00a0I feel very fortunate that my thrift store had mason jars for cheap! I could get a mason jar with the lid for around 50 cents.\u00a0I also bought grocery items in glass jars with the intention of reusing the jars. $15 worth of mason jars plus the ones from pasta sauce and salad dressing gave me a pretty large collection of around 50 jars.I also had three roommates, and I collected all of their jars too.\u00a0I also picked up a couple yards of some nice scrap fabric at my local thrift store. I hand stitched dinner napkins for myself and Justin. I figured it was the cheapest way to get cute napkins.\u00a0I was also very into stitching at the time. I embroidered a cobra on the back of Justin\u2019s denim vest for Valentine\u2019s Day. It was a nice little hobby for me.\u00a0This was definitely a HUGE splurge item for me. I was also terrified of buying a . I had never liked wearing tampons, so making this switch was a little scary. Also, a HUGE investment for me at the time.\u00a0I wound up going with the * because it has a love it or your money back guarantee.\u00a0I knew if I didn\u2019t like it, I could always send it back. I wound up loving it, and it\u2019s one of the best purchases I\u2019ve made.\u00a0I found my very first klean kanteen at the thrift store for $1! I was so incredibly thrilled.\u00a0It was not an insulated klean kanteen, but I also found a stainless steel thermos for hot drinks. Justin and I both like iced coffee so we traded off on who got hot coffee with our one thermos and who got iced coffee in the mason jar.\u00a09 times out of 10, I got the iced coffee in the mason jar because it was just a little too \u201chipster\u201d for him.\u00a0I have to say, I thought * looked amazing. Look at the pockets! I could keep my mason jars from banging together when going to the grocery store!\u00a0But, those bags are complete and utter failures. By far, my most disappointing purchase I have made since going zero waste.\u00a0The pockets are sewn to high up on the bag. The pockets don\u2019t have any bottoms. They\u2019re open top and bottom, and any thing you put in them just falls out through the bottom of the pocket. Unless it\u2019s a baguette. The only thing tall enough to actually utilize the pocket is a baguette.\u00a0I still have the bags and use them, but they\u2019re not my favorite.\u00a0I honestly can\u2019t believe how many photos I have documenting my first zero waste purchases. This was before I had an instagram account or a blog.\u00a0It\u2019s nice to be reminded how enthusiastic and excited I was. Not that I\u2019m not excited now, but zero waste has become routine for me.Back then, it was all so new and thrilling! It was exciting, and every day was like a game. I woke up with a, \u201cHow can I avoid trash today?\u201d mentality.\u00a0Did you have a large start-up cost when you went zero waste? Were you budget savvy? How did you get started?\u00a0Hi Kathryn, I have been vegan for 4 years, mainly for environmental reasons, and I just decided to transition to zero waste as well. Your blog has been a great help so far! I do not have much disposable income at the moment (I\u2019m a graduate student) but I received a $100 Amazon gift card over the holidays and decided to use it to purchase the supplies I thought I\u2019d need to get started: microfiber cleaning cloths, dinner napkins, produce bags, castile soap, essential oils, wool dryer balls, lids for my mixing bowls, a microwave popcorn maker, and plant hangers for an indoor herb garden. Of course this purchase involves packaging but I already had the gift card. I\u2019m buying jars at a thrift store and saving the ones in my pantry. The one splurge purchase I hope to make soon is a soy and nut milk maker, which will save me a lot of time in the kitchen. Thank you for being an inspiration to all of us who are trying to make better choices for the environment!I received a reusable bag with pockets like you described. They are for keeping your wine bottles in place \ud83d\ude09I have one for wine bottles, this is not that type of bag unfortunately. It\u2019s just really poorly designed.I\u2019m just starting out, and it\u2019s not always easy to keep the family aligned with my ideals\u2026 Nor my purchases! Sometimes things backfire (I order or buy something with hidden plastic), sometimes I regret a purchase, sometimes I waste ingredients trying a new recipe\u2026 But I\u2019m moving in the right direction and that\u2019s enough to keep me going!Yes! That\u2019s so true. You\u2019ll eventually find your pattern and rhythm.Love, love, love this. It\u2019s so important to remember zero waste doesn\u2019t have to be expensive! In fact, in the long run, it\u2019ll save you a buck! ;DBtw, this post inspired me to make some DIY napkins for myself using scrap fabric! When I was younger, I was known as the \"napkin queen\" and literally used at least 10 napkins at the dinner table. Ugh. So glad I don\u2019t do that anymore, but I love the idea on cutting back on disposable napkins all together by DIYing some!Thanks for another great post. You rock!ArianaThe napkin queen! LOL. I love that. \ud83d\ude42Hi, I was wondering where you got the stainless dish drying rack that the thrift store mason jars are in?Hi! Just an idea, those bags you were dissapointed in, since you can handle a thread & needle, would it be possible to use some scrap fabric to make \"bottoms\" for the sleves? To adjust the bags more to your liking? It\u2019s too bad they made the design poorly, but if you could adjust them to better suit your needs they wouldn\u2019t be a waste? \ud83d\ude42 And you could get the intended use from them.Great post! I\u201dve recently started my zero waste journey and I\u2019m fascinated with all the ideas I can use to make my life more waste-free. So far, I haven\u2019t spent anything because I used the fabric that I already had at home to sew shopping bags and reusable cotton pads. When I read how much you paid for your mason jars and klean kanteen I started envying you a little bit \ud83d\ude42 Unfortunately, both these products are very expensive in my country and I will probably not be able to afford them anytime soon. I\u2019ll be documenting my zero waste struggles on my blog together with different sewing projects. I love your blog and I\u2019m going to look around here \ud83d\ude42Recently I bought a menstrual cup for about $12 and I\u2019m so pleased with it. I love that it saves money, reduces waste and makes me forget I\u2019m on my period. Highly recommend for anyone looking to buy less garbage!I was also surprised by the packaging. I ordered the Misscup online and expected a plastic-lined box inside a shipping box. Instead there was a padded shipping envelope with an instruction sheet, and ziplock bag containing the reusable pouch with menstrual cup (in another ziplock bag). So there was some plastic, but less than I expected. I saved the little bags and shipping envelope to reuse.I hadn\u2019t thought about making my own reusable napkins \u2013 thanks for the idea!I loved reading this blog. Great ideas! Makes me want to more cautious. Thanks for the inspiration.Love this post! I am very new to trying to reduce my waste. I purchased a college mason jars from the thrift store, my mom had about 8 from my wedding so I got those, too. I made some bags and have bought a couple. I\u2019ve made other small switches so far and can\u2019t wait to do more!I have purchased flannel receiving blankets at thrift shops. I\u2019ve been cut them into oval shapes a little bigger than my hand & sew two together. I have made what they call Family cloths or personal wipes. I can\u2019t tell you how much it has saved me in the cost of toilet paper. I still have toilet paper on the roll for company and to use when needed. I have a small step on plastic trash container next to the toilet that has bleach water in it (much like you would do for baby diapers years ago) and I am still using the cloths that I made 3 years ago. I also cut larger squares from receiving blankets p, and made approximately 30 cloth (paper) towels. I keep them in a small tray I bought from the dollar store and no longer purchase paper towels. I also have made dinner napkins from remnents purchased at the fabric store on sale.This might be a stupid question with an obvious answer. If you buy something like rice or oatmeal in bulk, how do you weigh it if you don\u2019t use a plastic bag? Do you use one of your pillowcase bags and pay for the extra weight?You can weigh whatever you\u2019re using when you first walk in and go to the same cashier.I have reusable cotton bags just so I don\u2019t have to bother with the Terra weight. When I get home, I empty it into glass containers.Nearly all scales (especially manual ones, not electronic) can have their 0 line set to the weight of your jar.So if you fill your jars with whatever you\u2019re buying, then at the counter dump the product into your extra bag (such as the pillow case bag) let the cashier weigh your jar and reset the scale, then you\u2019re good to go.I\u2019m sure some locations will let you weigh the jars first and have a cashier write on each jar how much they weigh before product is added.I hope this helps a little!A lot of stuff I use I already had (totally free metal water bottle, cloth napkins, *ahem, Captain America lunch box) and other things ive picked up along the way have all been pretty cheap. I love my beeswax wrap, most expensive item to date, at 9.99.Your email address will not be published.      Your browser must have Javascript support enabled to leave comments.    "},

I do.Really. The term zero is probably not the best term. It can be scary. I know. I\u2019m quoted saying as much in an article from the Guardian in 2016.\u00a0The main complaints I\u2019m hearing is that zero waste is too restrictive or that it doesn\u2019t cover enough issues like environmental racism, intersectionality, climate change, carbon footprints, etc. etc.\u00a0The thing is it\u2019s all interconnected, and wanting to live a zero waste lifestyle does in fact incorporate many of those things. I\u2019m constantly amazed how closely environmental and social problems are linked.\u00a0Recently, I attended the with \u00a0Twice on the same day in two different sessions, I heard people say overfishing is a major problem, and that the problem is exacerbated by  without appropriate labor costs the price of the fish is grossly undervalued.\u00a0If the price of fish accurately reflected all of the labor going into it, far less fish would be eaten simply because of the higher price tag. This would adjust the supply and demand.I\u2019m not saying it would solve the overfishing problem, but it would certainly be a start.\u00a0I had absolutely no idea that slavery in the fishing industry was a problem. I don\u2019t know enough about it right now, but it\u2019s just proving over and over how environmental and social issues are inextricably linked.\u00a0The other main complaint is perfectioninsm, and how no one can ever be completely waste\u2026.. um DUH.Most zero wasters have made this point over and over and over again.\u00a0\u00a0Zero waste is a goal. It\u2019s completely unachievable.The motto of my blog has literally been, \u201cIt\u2019s not about perfection; it\u2019s about making better choices.\u201d for years.\u00a0We\u2019re all human.We\u2019re all just doing the best we can and that\u2019s OK. Here\u2019s just a few of my posts breaking down the perfection complex.\u00a0All of these blog posts talk about the messy side of being zero waste \u2013 the non-perfect instagrammable side. Most zero waste bloggers have a very real and upbeat positive attitude woven throughout their posts.\u00a0They\u2019re encouraging you to do the best you can. We\u2019re never going to be perfect. We\u2019re just a bunch of people trying to have a positive impact on the planet.\u00a0A lot of people credit Bea Johnson from Zero Waste Home with \u201cinventing\u201d zero waste. While she certainly popularized it as an at home lifestyle, the term was first used in the 1970s by Paul Palmer as an industrial term.\u00a0Paul Palmer founded Zero Waste Solutions and it started by taking laboratory chemicals that were going to be wasted and instead resold them to scientists and companies.\u00a0Basically they didn\u2019t want the chemicals to go to waste so they came up with a solution to prevent it. Thus zero waste was born! (not quite)Even before that, zero waste happening. We just didn\u2019t have a fancy term for it. In fact, zero waste is super unsexy. It\u2019s depression era living or just regular living up until the 1950s.\u00a0No one wasted anything because our consumption levels were vastly different because we lived in a completely different world.\u00a0Currently everything is globalized. If you haven\u2019t read by Thomas Friedman, it\u2019s definitely worth checking out from your local library. It talks about globalization and the shift that\u2019s happening with technology.\u00a0If you wanted a new outfit in the 1930s you weren\u2019t going to be able to buy something mass-manufactured and made in Bangladesh for $15. No, you were going to buy something made close to you.You might have even bought a pattern to sew it at home. It was going to be something of quality that would last.It would be something that came from your surrounding area.\u00a0If you bought it from a store or catalogue,\u00a0the person who made it was paid a living wage. The price of the dress would accurately reflect all of these things.A new outfit in the mid 1930s cost on average $7 which would be the equivalent of spending $130-150 today. Most ethical fashion brands charge around that price point.\u00a0If every piece of clothing I owned cost $140 dollars, you can bet your bottom dollar that I would be SO picky about what I bought and I would own far fewer clothes.\u00a0It\u2019s probably why the average woman only owned 9 outfits and took much greater care of her belongings.\u00a0We didn\u2019t waste as much simply because we didn\u2019t have the means.If your grandparents are still living, talk to them.The thought of buying a product to throw away like paper towels or paper tissues was absurd. They might have adapted now, but it\u2019s certainly not the way they grew up.\u00a0People couldn\u2019t fathom spending money on items they were going to throw away. Even if they did have disposables like a brown paper lunch bag, I can guarantee you they carried it back and forth until it fell apart.\u00a0 was done just like zero wasters do it today. You would go to the store and you would give your list to the store manager.The items you were buying like sugar, flour, cornmeal, and beans were taken out of larger bags and weighed. They would wrap your groceries in paper and you\u2019d take the goods home.\u00a0This is why you hear funny anecdotal stories of people making cakes and ice cream with salt instead of sugar. It\u2019s because the bags weren\u2019t labeled. The dry goods were bought in bulk with NO labels.\u00a0While living low waste, reducing, reusing, and repairing as much as we can is awesome and amazing \u2013 it\u2019s still not circular.\u00a0Granted, appliances from the 40s, 50s, 60s, and even into the 70s were meant to be repaired. That certainly plays a huge role in it.It\u2019s when we start to get into the 80s that companies realize in order to drive more growth, the products need to be very difficult to repair and that they need to break quicker.The quicker you can break a product the quicker you can make a new sale.\u00a0It\u2019s called planned obsolescence and we\u2019ve talked about it on the blog . This is when the problem really started getting out of control.We live in a linear economy, and our earth has finite resources.\u00a0Basically we take resources from the earth, we manufacture them into products, and then we throw them into a giant hole in the ground. Living this way makes absolutely no sense. We will run out of resources.\u00a0Resources are valuable. So why aren\u2019t we doing anything with them?\u00a0Of course recycling plays a tiny, tiny role in trying to recover some materials, but it\u2019s just not the solution.\u00a0Products need to be designed with complete absorption back into the manufacturing process.\u00a0When we resume products back into the system fully, we have what\u2019s called a circular economy. This circular economy reflects nature. In nature there is no trash or waste. A \u201cwaste\u201d product like poop is actually vital to the system. It provides vital nutrients to plants.\u00a0Living in a linear economy seemed fairly stable until we started consuming at higher rates and planned obsolescence became normal. Now we\u2019re consuming at a completely unsustainable rate.\u00a0We\u2019re currently consuming 1.5 earths worth of resources each year and we have a day to mark it called Earth Overshoot Day.It\u2019s the day that we\u2019ve consumed all of the resources the earth can sustainably produce for the coming year.\u00a0We hit it on August 2, 2017 and each year the day is moved up earlier and earlier on the calendar.The problem is becoming worse and worse, so what can we do?\u00a0There are actually a lot of things we can do.\u00a0First, we can try to live a zero waste lifestyle. A zero waste lifestyle aims to live like older generations. It\u2019s using our personal lives and personal consumption habits as an act of rebellion or protest.\u00a0We focus on buying only what we need. Reusing what we have as long as we can by performing regular maintenance,\u00a0repairing, opting for non-disposable options when possible,\u00a0and purchasing second hand.\u00a0Lastly we focus on recycling and composting. The goal is to try to reduce and reuse as much as possible first.\u00a0\u00a0So, before you recycle something, can you use it for something else? Before you compost it can you ?\u00a0Is this a perfect way of living? No, of course not. Does it completely represent a circular economy? No, of course not.\u00a0We\u2019re living in a flawed system, but what it does is challenge the norm. It brings about new ideas and innovations.\u00a0We tend to forget how much power the consumer has. When enough people stand up and say, \u201cWe want circular!!\u201d More businesses are going to start looking at circular solutions.\u00a0It\u2019s amazing how many zero waste or low waste shops have popped up in the last several years simply because the demand is there! Keep demanding change, and change will come.\u00a0Trying to live more sustainably doesn\u2019t have to be rocket science. Just find a few things that work with your schedule. I always recommend people start with the  But, honestly just try something new!\u00a0Once you\u2019ve mastered one thing, then try another. It takes a lot of time, but with patience and perseverance you can make a huge impact with a few small changes.\u00a0 The next thing you can do, once you feel like you have a firm grasp on sustainable changes you\u2019ve made in your life, look for a supportive community.It\u2019s always easier to enter into activism with a . I just wrote a whole post on this subject because it\u2019s an important first step when lobbying for big change.\u00a0Then the next step is working as a local community to apply pressure to local businesses. This will be the next blog post in my series. There\u2019s a lot I want to cover here, but it starts with small business.\u00a0What can small businesses do? Maybe the coffee shop incentivizes the use of bringing your own mug.Maybe they start charging for disposable take away cups, maybe you get the grocery store to put up signs about rethinking plastic bags.\u00a0Eva from Kind Planet  in her local grocery store. How cool is that!?\u00a0It\u2019s always much easier to enact change at the local level, but eventually we have to take it to the top to the major polluters like Coca-Cola and Nestle.But, that can\u2019t happen until there\u2019s more awareness and more people power.\u00a0In order to get more awareness and people power, it has to start small. Movements don\u2019t happen quickly. They happen slowly and take lots of energy and lots of man power.\u00a0Once there\u2019s general unrest, you can start to form policy. The people must first act so policy can react.\u00a0Once again, this starts at the local level. With California\u2019s bag ban, enough counties and cities passed bag bans that it became too complicated.In order to simplify and streamline all of the bag ban laws the whole state decided on one policy.\u00a0It takes enough people at the local level with their local community to push for change. This happens city and county wide, then state wide, then nationally.\u00a0Then once the national laws go into effect, this changes the practices of the larger companies and businesses and the smaller business, then it affects the consumer. Then we start the cycle again.\u00a0For more information on getting involved in your , you can read this blog post here.\u00a0I feel that there is general unrest in the zero waste movement simply because things move slowly.\u00a0 The solution is to go local.We have to be present in our own communities. We have to be working for legislation, influencing businesses, and growing a local community at the grassroots level.\u00a0\u00a0Change is coming, and it\u2019s all thanks to you!\u00a0Each and every one of you play a vital role in this movement. It\u2019s not about fitting your trash in a jar (that\u2019s a media gimmick).It\u2019s not about winning zero waste. It\u2019s not a competition to see who\u2019s the most environmentally friendly, the most vegan, the most sustainable, or the most plastic free.\u00a0It\u2019s just about trying.\u00a0And, not everyone will be able to participate fully at all times. Some may never be able to participate, and that\u2019s OK!\u00a0It\u2019s just a whole bunch of people trying to enact change where they can and using their voice to rewrite the system. Using their voice to demand change. Using their choices and purchases as an act of protest.\u00a0I leave you with this amazing video about the circular economy. I hope you\u2019re inspired and come away with a new passion for zero waste and what it really means.\u00a0\"I had absolutely no idea that slavery in the fishing industry was a problem.\"Neither did I!!Thanks for writing about this; sometimes I consider giving up Zero Waste blogs, since I run into so much of the same info again and again\u2014 but there\u2019s still plenty to learn about how our choices affect others and what happens when we aren\u2019t looking.There\u2019s always more to learn, unfortunately\u2026. most of it\u2019s bad news\u2026I loved that you recorded the post! You actually have a very nice voice, and it allowed me to listen to it while pretending I was working, so win-win, I guess.I\u2019m so glad you liked it! I\u2019m going to try and record more of my posts.Not sure if I was on a blog about zero waste, or some advertisement site of Disney World.I loved the recording, you should make a podcast! Do you know any podcasts to do with these topics?thnaks for the siteReally nice post. We are planing to lunch few products such as beeswax wraps and cotton produce bags to compliment zero waste movement and contribute to changes.

These four items are easy to avoid and make-up a huge portion of waste in landfills and the ocean.\u00a0All of these swaps are convenience items that are to avoid, and I\u2019ll show you how.\u00a0The U.S. uses 100 billion plastic shopping bags each year, and it takes 12 million barrels of oil to make them.\u00a0Bringing your own bags to the grocery store is pretty no brainer, but the tricky part is actually remembering them.\u00a0I remember the first time I went to the grocery store after deciding to go zero waste, and I forgot my reusable bags.\u00a0I had two options, I could either go home and get them or I could justify using plastic bags. I decided if I justified using the plastic bags, I would justify it in the future.\u00a0I decided to go home and get them. I created a pain point, and I have to say I\u2019ve never forgotten my bags since.\u00a0If you forget your bags try and think through your patterns.Plastic water bottles are great for times of crisis. They\u2019re not so great if you have access to clean drinking water.\u00a050 Billion plastic water bottles are consumed and disposed of each year. Since the , none of these water bottles are recycled.\u00a0Plastic in the ocean is piling up. 8 million tons of plastic is dumped in the ocean annually. We have to move away from this disposable, convenience based culture we\u2019ve created.\u00a0We\u2019ve all become so busy, that we don\u2019t have time to fill up a water bottle?\u00a0I know a lot of people don\u2019t particularly care for the taste of the tap water, and my suggestion is filtering it. Read this post if you\u2019re looking for a .\u00a0If you\u2019re always running late, and want to grab a bottle and go, buy aand keep them in the fridge. You\u2019ll always have cold, filtered water ready to go.\u00a0My favorite reusable bottles are glass and * because they both have 100% recycle rate without loss of quality.\u00a0If I have a small handbag, I like to slip in a stainless flask or a maple syrup bottle of water in my bag. However, you might get some funny looks.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 on Say no to single-use plastic straws!\u00a0When you\u2019re out at a restaurant or bar ask for no straw in your drink order. If you like straws or drink a lot of smoothies that are difficult to drink from the rim of the glass go for a reusable straw.\u00a0There are a lot of different types of reusable straws *, *, *, and *. They even have *!\u00a0Take away coffee cups might just be the bane of my existence. There are SO many alternatives\u2026 like sitting in the cafe and asking for it in a mug.\u00a0It\u2019s so simple! Drinking your coffee in the shop, in a mug, is completely free. If you\u2019re in a rush, you can always ask for your coffee at a more drinkable temperature.\u00a0If you want to grab your coffee to-go, think about brining along a *. A lot of coffee shops will even give you a discount for BYO.\u00a0Since, I carry a reusable water bottle with me most days, I like to carry a *.\u00a0It being double insulated keeps hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold. This way, I can grab a hot coffee or an iced coffee while out. I just pour out my water, typically in a nearby plant, and get my coffee to-go!\u00a0Once I\u2019ve consumed my coffee, I rinse my bottle out in a sink and then fill it with water.\u00a0People often assume that preventing waste and trash requires you to carry a lot of stuff with you, but that\u2019s just not true.\u00a0All I typically carry with me is a water bottle. Of course having a bag to slip my water bottle into is really nice. My husband always carries a backpack, and it\u2019s really easy for him to tote along his water bottle too.\u00a0If you\u2019re looking for more beginners tips make sure to check out these posts!\u00a0Completely agree with your big four for starting out plastic free. Keep it simple and make an effort to sustain your practice long term so plastic free becomes a real ingrained habit.I still forget bags when grocery shopping \u2013 it takes hours of repetition to change these old habits!Thank youBrenIt\u2019s so true! repetition and building the habit is everything!!I have been attempting zero waste for months now and I still forget my bags sometimes! Another trick that my mom does when she forgets her bags is just load up everything back into the shopping cart (without bags) and put it straight into the trunk of her car. When she gets home she can bag everything to take it inside with her reusable bags.That\u2019s a great idea!Flask for small purses is genius!!! I already have two stainless steel flasks ready to go!Hello! So lucky to have you sharing your tips \u2026 thank you!! With regard to coffee, I would encourage everyone to brew their own coffee. It is so easy and fast and will help not only with eliminating the use of plastic to go coffee cups but will save you so much money! And, trust me, it tastes better too!That\u2019s awesome! Those are great starters for every single person to start implementing.

I\u2019m currently wondering how I\u2019m going to get a full 1,000 word blog post out of it without resorting to more battle analogies, but for your sake \u2013 I\u2019ll spare you.\u00a0All you need is a couple of minutes, a little commitment, and a \u00a0Dump all of your trash out and go through it. For each item you find write it on the clipboard. For each recurring item add a tally mark. Like below:This will give you a nice visual road map on how to reduce your trash.\u00a0You can figure out where you can make the biggest impact.\u00a0I love it when people just want to dive into zero waste, 100%, right away! But, it\u2019s hard. There\u2019s a lot of changes that you\u2019ll be making, and it\u2019s important to avoid burn out because it is IMPOSSIBLE to go zero waste overnight.\u00a0It\u2019s impossible to do it in a week or even a month! I STILL have products from my PZW days even three years later.\u00a0Now, you can start looking for easy zero waste swaps. Always start with the things you\u2019re throwing away most for two reasons.I\u2019d want to tackle the first five right off the bat.\u00a0 The first thing I would do is start phasing out paper towels for reusable dish towels. Get my .\u00a0 Then I\u2019d start composting. Composting is one of the best things you can do for the environment!

Check out , and my .\u00a0\u00a0 You can buy q-tips with paper bases instead of plastic ones and then throw them in your compost!\u00a0\u00a0As far as jello cups go, you could make a big batch of jello from the box. You can recycle or compost the box, and then divide the homemade jello up into individual containers *.Not all schools allow glass in lunch boxes, so a * might be a good option instead of plastic.\u00a0 Avoiding coffee cups is pretty easy! Check out all my tips in this post about Your trash probably changes from week to week. Keep checking in on your trash and recycling to see where you can easily improve.\u00a0Obviously, there will always be some unavoidable trash. The first thing that pops into my mind is medication.\u00a0I get a lot of people emailing me asking how to handle the trash with their medication\u2026. and my answer is always the same.\u00a0YOUR HEALTH COMES FIRST!!!\u00a0I will scream it from the rafters.

Today we\u2019re also kicking off the G7 summit following World Environment Day whose theme was Beat Plastic Pollution.\u00a0Plastic pollution has really been in the spotlight, and I\u2019m loving it!\u00a0I have been able to connect with so many people through the  that just came out.\u00a0It can be really difficult to know where to start when it comes to breaking up with plastic. I wanted to give you my top five tips for phasing it out of your life.\u00a0When you really start to see all of the plastic,\u00a0you can\u2019t un-see it. Plastic is EVERYWHERE.\u00a0It seems like you\u2019ll never be able to escape it, but I promise with a little bit of patience you will. It just takes time. Don\u2019t feel like you have to do everything RIGHT NOW.\u00a0It\u2019s ok to be patient. No one goes zero waste or plastic free overnight.Go slowly and start with what you can. I recommend starting with. These four simple swaps happen outside of the home. This way you can focus on using up what you have inside of the home before moving on.\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s completely contradictory to the zero waste lifestyle to throw everything out and upgrade to new eco-friendly products.\u00a0I wrote a post about , which will be really helpful when making the transition.I think you\u2019ll be surprised with how many disposable and plastic items you own when you really take the time to go through your cabinets and drawers.\u00a0If something is in good shape and can be donated and you don\u2019t want it anymore, donate it or list it on a freecycle group, craigslist, or the facebook market place.\u00a0Going zero waste is just as much about adding new products into the second hand market for others to use. This prevents new resources from being used in the creation of new products.You can read this post about  which goes more in depth on this topic.\u00a0For products that aren\u2019t suitable for donation. Perhaps cosmetics and food in packaging that has been opened. Use it up!\u00a0Don\u2019t automatically run out for zero waste counterparts. To be honest, I still have some makeup I\u2019m using from my pre-zero waste days! (PZWD) It\u2019s OK.\u00a0Use up what you have and then move on, when you\u2019re done.If you\u2019re uncomfortable with some of the ingredients in these products, see if you can pass them off to a family member or friend only if they would buy that product anyway.\u00a0Sometimes, it\u2019s nice to have disposable things for certain special circumstances. I still have a couple of plastic razors from my PZWD.\u00a0You can\u2019t take a  with you  If I\u2019m traveling, I pull out one of those razors.I still have trash bags from my PZWD! I keep them for neighborhood and beach clean-ups. These are resources I bought long before I knew about zero waste, but there\u2019s no reason I should throw them out.\u00a0At the same time, you also don\u2019t want the temptation to reach for these items especially when you\u2019re just starting on your zero waste journey. Take these items and put them in a hard to reach place.\u00a0This will discourage you from reaching for them, but they\u2019ll still be accessible for these unusual life events.\u00a0I\u2019m not going to lie to you, companies make a lot of really cute plastic stuff. There are a lot of great products packaged in plastic.\u00a0Whenever I find myself tempted, I like to remind myself that plastic is toxic. It isn\u2019t just bad for our health it\u2019s also bad for the health of our planet.If I have the choice, I don\u2019t want to buy my food surrounded in plastic. The plastic can leach chemicals into the food.\u00a0I don\u2019t want to sleep on a . There are so many examples of products that I try to avoid beyond the environmental reasons, it\u2019s really just better for our health.\u00a0If you\u2019re struggling with breaking free from plastic, find something that\u2019s a treat for you! One of the great bonuses of living plastic free and having a pantry sans labels is that things become very aesthetically pleasing.\u00a0While consumerism isn\u2019t the point of zero waste living, buying something you\u2019re super excited about using can be really helpful!\u00a0Maybe you\u2019ve just had your eye on a set of ,\u00a0, or an .\u00a0Go for it! Splurge a little if it will help you reduce overall.\u00a0\u00a0While it\u2019s always best to shop the second hand market first, sometimes throwing in a little bit shiny and new can help you get really excited all over again!\u00a0Going plastic free and zero waste is a journey that will never be complete.\u00a0The bottom line is do the best you can.\u00a0Hi! I will move in my first appartment with my boyfriend in only two weeks and I would like to go zero waste. The only problem is that he can\u2019t let go of Ziplock bags.. He finds it weird to replace it by a simple fabric bag and his reason not to try it is that he is used to Ziplock. Do you have some advice? Thank you \ud83d\ude42Hey Audrey, not sure if this will help but they make food safe sandwich bags that are lined with an easy to clean liner if your boyfriend is concerned with his sandwich being smushed they also make stainless steel containers or glass containers that are in the shape of a standard sandwich. The stainless steel or glass containers are probably more airtight than the fabric options, one place I know that sells them is the Package Free Store, they have an online store also.Thank you! I\u2019ll try buying some fabric bags with a liner like you said and maybe one day he\u2019ll actualy like them and use them hahaI am struggling to find groceries NOT contained in plastic. I cannot afford to shop at Whole Foods, and most store near me package their lettuce and salad in plastic, their meat in plastic, so much in plastic. What do you do about products like this?What about things like soup and sauce..Costco has a great pesto that I love in a plastic sealed jar\u2026how can I get products like this?Your email address will not be published.

Lots of places are jumping on the \u201cNo Straw\u201d train and it\u2019s pretty\u00a0 exciting!\u00a0It\u2019s exciting to see something that you\u2019ve been working to raise awareness on become a national topic! There are several things I hope come to fruition with this in the spotlight.My first hope, is that we will see straws as a gateway into a larger conversation. For me, this has never been about the straw. It\u2019s always been about the bigger picture. In order for people to connect with a cause it must become personal.\u00a0Straws are something that most of us interact with in our daily lives. It\u2019s an inexpensive change often costing nothing. It\u2019s an easy swap that doesn\u2019t require anyone to go out of their way other than to say a few words, \u201cNo straw, please.\u201dI hope we can continue this momentum into a more meaningful conversation about single-use plastic, over consumption, and the misuse of resorces.\u00a0My second hope, is that we will be kinder. I hope that we will learn to listen. I personally am for a straw on request policy. It\u2019s one I\u2019ve proposed in my own town.\u00a0Straws serve a vital purpose for those who need them, and they should be available!\u00a0Your job is not to criticize someone who says they need a straw. It is to listen to them.\u00a0It\u2019s like if someone hurts your feelings, and you say, \u201cYou hurt my feelings!\u201d And, they say, \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d The other person can\u2019t tell you how you feel. Does that make sense?\u00a0You don\u2019t get to tell other people how to feel. You don\u2019t get to tell them how to react or what they need to survive. You have to trust that they know their bodies better than you.\u00a0What you do, is listen.\u00a0We all need to work together to find solutions. Besides, a few plastic straws reserved for helping people in need is something I think we can all get behind!\u00a0This is why this movement has to be about  than straws. I\u2019m sure we can all agree that straws is only one small piece of the puzzle.\u00a0So, let\u2019s keep pushing!\u00a0Of course, if you don\u2019t need a straw to drink you can always ask for \u201cNo Straw,\u201d with your drink order!\u00a0It\u2019s a really simple  way to reduce your waste!\u00a0Of course they do make a number of reusable options and below I break down the pros and cons of each one based on a number of different factors.\u00a0But if you need a little extra help I have also created a fun quiz that will analyze every part of your personality to pick the exact, perfect straw for you!\u00a0Let me know what type of straw you are in the comment section down below.It\u2019s no secret that glass straws are my personal favorite.\u00a0These are the that I own!\u00a0I like my . I have a whole bunch so I\u2019m always ready for a smoothie party. My favorite stainless straws are my !\u00a0I have used , never a \u00a0I\u2019ve had silicone straws for ages mostly because my partner likes to use straws. He has liked them and they are nicely coloured. I rarely use a straw so I just like that we have a more sustainable option in our house rather than a disposable one \ud83d\ude42LiiI am a silicone straw! : )It said I am a glass straw and that totally matches my favorite straws! I love that I can see how clean they are! I also use a stainless steel straw and with a silicone mouth piece. It is great for travel!I\u2019m a stainless steel straw ? now I know!I\u2019m so glad and relieved you addressed #2. Thank you. I see people wanting to ban straws telling people with disabilities about all the alternatives, about how easy it is to just bring your own, etc. as if they don\u2019t know their own needs and haven\u2019t done the research themselves. To be truly sustainable we have to bring everyone along with us.I have a collection of silicone and stainless steel straws but I always find myself grabbing the stainless because they of course, retain their shape, and I can easily slide one into my purse. Took the quiz and got stainless! Yay! Now to find one of the big boba ones you mention because my only gripe with them is they are narrower than glass, bamboo, and silicone. Thank you for all the research!Hi! I really apperciate your post. I would like to take your mini-quiz in the middle but the background is too dark to read.Hi! This is not related to straws (I have and love stainless steel), but actually laundry detergent. Have you heard of Dropps, and if so, what are your thoughts? It seems like a great solution from what I\u2019ve seen so far.What exact;y is a boba straw? Nothing really comes up on Amazon. Or, I\u2019m clueless. Thanks.Never mind. I was finally able to figure it out. So, clueless is the correct answer. \ud83d\ude42Thanks For an informative BlogsWe should start using eco straw for us to save the environment. We have seen marine animals get poison by these plastic straws. We can\u2019t deny the fact that we are responsible for the destruction of the aquatic homes. I believe that using paper straws or ecostraws can help save our environment and converse our marine aquatic resources. For example, , these products are eco-friendly and made from papers.I have to be honest, I thought the metal straws were the coolest reusable straw option until I read that story about the person who died from them. Now I will just stick with the paper ones! Glad that more and more people are on board with transitioning away from plastic though and that is what matters most!Buying metallic straws is like your pledge to help in making the environment better. Save the planet and use metallic straws.Thanks For such an existing post. I appreciate that your post is really informative.Your email address will not be published.

After seeing the report from the UN by IPCC, I needed to spend some time grounding myself.If you\u2019re not familiar with the report, basically a whole bunch of scientists got together and concluded we have 12 years before we\u2019re going to see lasting, catastrophic damage due to the amount of carbon in the atmosphere.You can see the report .This report gave me pause. I felt helpless, alone, and scared. I felt like I wasn\u2019t doing enough \u2013 like it was NEVER going to be enough.And, that\u2019s the thing about articles and studies like that\u2026 EVERYONE FEELS HOPELESS AFTER READING IT.So I\u2019ve written out my fool proof way for getting yourself out of this funk, and harnessing all that awesome power that you,   an individual, have!You are not alone.You are not alone.You are not alone.Articles like this do a great job of isolating us. It makes us look at our close friends and family that we don\u2019t consider to be on our \u201ceco level\u201d and wonder, \u201cIf they\u2019re not on board, how is anything ever going to improve!?\u201dSpeaking of which, check out this post .But, the fact of the matter is that you\u2019re not alone.

One of my tag lines is \u2018Breaking zero waste living down into a simple step-by-step process with lots of positivity and love!\u201dBut, even I felt lonely when reading this article.One of the things I do to maintain positivity is intentionally seeking out positive news. I make sure that I\u2019m following accounts on social media that have a positive and uplifting take on what\u2019s happening.It is easy to be sad, defeatist, and negative. It takes courage to be strong and positive in the face of adversity, and it is the ONLY way we\u2019re going to turn this ship around.We need positive and energetic change because positivity is infectious. People want a dose of that. People want to be around people that make them feel good.When the pressure hits, you can start being hyper critical of what everyone in your life is doing. Step back and instead of nagging about what they don\u2019t do\u2026 lavish praise on what they do.Humans are animals. We love positive reinforcement. So positively reinforce their good, eco friendly habits. I promise you it totally works!!So, now that we know how to combat negative news and be a shining beacon in our communities\u2026. let\u2019s get down to fighting climate change!I\u2019ve said it a million times, but there are four pieces to this puzzle.All four pieces of this puzzle HAVE to be moving at the SAME TIME.We cannot create long, lasting and impactful change without ALL OF THEM. This is in reference to the fact that people think individual action doesn\u2019t matter at all. Yes, 71% of all global emissions are being created by 100 companies.But, that doesn\u2019t mean our actions aren\u2019t equally important. Most people don\u2019t know that there\u2019s a problem. Let alone that they\u2019re connected to the problem.Businesses and politicians react to the will of the people.When I was speaking at the Zero Waste Youth Conference, someone speaking from Californian\u2019s Against Waste said, \u201cCitizens must first act so policy can react.\u201dThis applies 100% to businesses too.Citizens have to act. We have to show government and business that this is what we want. OBVIOUSLY I\u2019m not saying that businesses are blameless, but we as individuals absolutely have a part to play.We have to urge them to act. We have to fight for policy changes. Individual action is where it all starts!I will briefly discuss each of the four ways but for a more in depth look at each one, please watch the video at the bottom of the page.This is where it all begins. I have hundreds of blog posts to help you live your values in your daily life.

I want to echo your message and add this: Recently I had a rather heated debate with someone about straws. His final throwdown was that eliminating plastic straws would only take about 11% of the plastic out of our oceans. I said EXACTLY! So we\u2019ll do something just as effective 9 more times and problem solved. He really couldn\u2019t argue with that.That\u2019s so great, Elena. Thank you for sharing!Hi Kathryn, thank you for doing this! I think your most important message here is that we all need to \"find our tribe.\" We need to, like you said, realize we are not alone. We need to stop keeping this anxiety inside ourselves. When we can talk about it, openly, with our friends and other people, we begin to see that we can change the culture by forming smaller subcultures that do not accept the status quo as inevitable. Whether that is by changing our own patterns of living, or through larger actions. I would add 350.org to your list of fantastic organizations to support by the way. I am subscribing. Keep up the good work. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re out there.That\u2019s such a good organization! Thank you for adding it. \ud83d\ude42Hi Kathryn. I\u2019m glad to see this post, because I had the same overwhelming emotions as you. I wanted to tell you about The Climate Mobilization, which is an organization I\u2019m involved with that seeks to address climate change like the emergency it is, and mobilize to reducing emissions at World War 2 speed. We\u2019ve had a good amount of success so far, especially in California, and Colorado is ramping up. We need all the momentum we can get though. Would you be willing to check it out?I will definitely check it out, thank you so much for sharing!Thank you for this post, and your positive mission to change the world. I\u2019ve needed this over the last few weeks.Love this! I felt the same way. Its good to know we\u2019re not in this alone! thanks lady. x taren @wildfolkco.comThank you for this video.

{"url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroWaste/wiki/index", "title": "indexZeroWaste", "body": "In general, the best way to move toward a zero waste lifestyle is one small step at a time. The first question is obvious: What am I throwing out? Start being more conscientious of what you're tossing into garbage and recycle bins. Then, identify one thing that you commonly throw away and could easily replace with a reusable item (such as replacing paper coffee cups with a travel mug.)As you continue making one change after another, you may find yourself considering a home composting setup, buying food in bulk, turning down free samples (and their associated packaging), taking steps to eliminate junk mail, and acquiring other reusable items to replace disposable products. . For example, purchasing reusable silverware for use away from home does no good if you never remember to use it and/or give up on it after a few months. (You might also ask yourself if purchasing a new item is really necessary or if you could instead use something you already own or can get from a friend or secondhand store.)There are three basic things to consider, when looking at any choice mentioned in this wiki: how convenient it is for you, how expensive in time or money it may be for you, and the environmental impact your choice will make. Below are a few articles to help people new to zero waste get off on the right foot. Throughout the rest of this wiki are several practical suggestions that have accumulated through the discussions here at . and Low income/frugal/budget zero waste Zero waste is a waste prevention and management strategy gaining popularity among individuals as well as industries, communities, and businesses. The goal - as this is more of a goal or an ideal than a hard target - is to emulate sustainable natural cycles where all discarded materials are designed to become resources for other uses, which will themselves become resources for other uses, and so on. Therefore, ideally, nothing is sent to landfills or incinerators. Zero waste strives for reduced resource use, use of recycled or less impactful materials, longer product lives, reparability, product sharing, and recovery of materials from products reaching end of life.  Concretely for most individuals, zero waste means gradually trying to reduce their trash by avoiding unnecessary products or packaged products, avoiding single-use items like straws and cutlery, composting, considering full product lifecycle, and being more mindful consumers overall. The \"5 R's\" motto comes from  and can provide some guidelines to zero waste decision-making. In order of preference: REFUSE what you do not need. REDUCE what you do need. REUSE by using reusables. RECYCLE what you cannot refuse, reduce, or reuse. ROT (compost) the rest.The Earth has some materials that are renewable or constantly replenished, such as wind, sunlight, wood, etc. and others that exist in only a limited quantity or which are much more slowly and less reliably replenished, such as oil, clean water, healthy soil/farmland, etc. Our current model of consumption changes natural raw materials such as wood, oil, and coal into products such as paper packaging, plastic wrap, and plastic bottles (made from petroleum), diesel fuel or electricity from burning coal, which makes the air harder to breathe, etc. If we then throw all of that stuff in a trash can that is emptied into a landfill (a place where they bury trash), we will not be able to use any of those resources again. With a population of 7 billion people and growing, it is only a matter of time before this way of living becomes impossible. We must all learn to live by using fewer natural resources and make sure to recycle things like paper and glass so they can be reused. The Zero Waste lifestyle aims to reduce/eliminate unnecessary packaging waste, reduce the use of fuel, avoid throwing away food that was grown using lots of energy, soil, and often chemicals that further deplete soil and poison waterways.Following the 5 R's, the first preference is to . Ask yourself if you really need an item, and always use up what you have before buying anything else. It may be tempting to go out and buy a natural bristle dish brush, but if you can make your current plastic one last two years before discarding it, it will have been more worth the natural resources it took to make it. For items you can't live without, see below for zero waste alternatives.The exception to this is if you have something that you know someone else can use. If you can divert one of their purchases, that's great!Honestly it's hard to get around plastic. It's in everything from cloth to cars to appliances to pens to smartphones. Plastic is made from petroleum, which is perhaps our most limited resource. It is getting harder to extract and takes lots of energy to extract, and it is most needed in airplanes and technologies that cannot run on any renewable fuel as of yet. Not all plastics are equal though, some are made for long term use (like PEX plumbing), some are designed for one use only (plastic shrink wrap around packages.) As always, the goal is to minimize what you're throwing out, so it's great to avoid plastic whenever you can. PVC, or recycle #3, is the worst plastic to produce, environmentally speaking, so that's a good one to avoid purchasing. Recycled plastic would be a great option if you do need plastic in your life. And of course, if you do use plastic, try to find a way to safely reuse and then recycle it.There are many different kinds of plastics out there, and science doesn't actually know all of their long term effects on human health. Many Zero Wasters try to move away from plastic as much as possible.Thread : First, most materials cannot be recycled indefinitely. Paper can be recycled about 7 times, and plastic even less than that. Aluminum and other metals are much easier to recycle, and the demand for recycled metals is high. Second, the demand for recycled paper and plastic is low, so it is not always cost-effective for people to actually recycle the stuff you throw in the recycle bin. It may end up in a landfill instead of recycled. For these reasons, it is a much safer bet to reduce and reuse and perhaps \"up-cycle\" (make new items out of \"trash\" materials) as much as possible before relying on the recycling industry to keep your materials from being wasted.Furthermore, the waste hierarchy (reduce, reuse, recycle) is based on a qualitative measure of a process's energy requirement. Consider bottled water. Recycling plastic water bottles requires energy 1) to produce the original bottle, 2) to recycle the used bottle, and 3) to produce the next water bottle (plastic water bottles are made from a combination of new plastic and some recycled plastic.) If you reuse the original water bottle for something else (maybe a vase for flowers), you eliminate all three steps from the vase, but the steps for the bottle remain (assuming you ultimately recycle it and continue purchasing bottle water.) Finally, if you reduce your need for bottles by reusing the same bottle or by drinking from an item you already have, that eliminates steps 2 and 3 for the original bottle and all three steps for all the bottles you never purchase, requiring the least energy of all.Thus, of those three options, recycling requires the most energy and therefore has the most negative environmental impact. 'Most negative' is a relative term here: They are all preferential to landfilling.It depends on each person and which products they choose to replace, but overall I believe the answer is yes. Since the largest goal of zero-waste is reducing - reducing purchases to what you need or how much you need of it, etc - costs typically get reduced as well. Cooking at home instead of going out to eat or even making your own products are great ways to save a significant amount of money while reducing waste. For example, I make my own toothpaste, laundry soap, face wash, shampoo, etc. Each of these alternatives is less expensive than commercial products and works just as well, if not better in some cases. Additionally, buying in bulk is more of an up-front cost, which may make it seem more expensive, but costs less in the long run.Yes, it may cost you more in time. The plus side of this is that you get to custom create things just how you want or like or need them.You will see people using the term \"bulk food\" a lot in this subreddit and other zero waste communities. This refers to loose bulk, where you can buy whatever quantity you need, rather than Costco type of bulk, where you can buy a large package of a product in one go. Places offering loose bulk typically make it possible to bring your own containers or to reuse the store container several times, thus avoiding single use packaging.That being said, buying a large package of a product that you know won't go bad or tempt you to use more of it, could be a good strategy to reduce your waste, assuming that the large package is not made up of several smaller, individually packaged units. Some people find it helpful to join in with friends in bulk purchasing, to lower the costs for everyone.Ask a cashier to weigh your jars before you start filling them with goodies, or do it at home on your own scale. This is called the 'tare' weight, which you'll need to mark on your jars so that the container's weight can be deducted during checkout. Same applies to reusable bags which usually have a bit of weight to them. If you purchase bags meant for this purpose they typically have the tare marked on them. If they do not or if you made them yourself, mark the tare permanently so you won't need to weigh them every time.It's helpful to bring a variety of container sizes depending on what you plan on purchasing. Many grocery stores have a list online of the bulk items they offer so you can plan accordingly. It also doesn't hurt to browse through the bulk section for just an item or two to get the hang of it before taking on a larger grocery run.Wide mouth jars are generally easier to clean and to fit the scoop size of items like flour, which can be messy otherwise. For fine items such as baking soda and flour, or for other items that leave residue, it is best to use a jar over a bag. For items that aren't messy or fine, such as dried beans or pasta, a bag should do well if you don't want to carry too many jars. Don't forget to mark the bin number, and of course, make sure everything is clean!It takes a few trips to get the hang of it, and you may find yourself under- or over-prepared at times, and that's okay! You'll quickly learn what suits you, and it will become a much quicker process.Farmer's markets tend to be very zero waste friendly, and directly support your local economy. To find one near you, try  - US only link, sorry. Going zero waste is a commitment to the process of reducing your waste and environmental impact. In this case, it is not worth driving long distances to avoid packaging instead of going to a local store that has packaged goods. Buy the largest packages that can be used in your household before expiring. Don't get twenty half-pound plastic pouches of microwave rice when there's a ten-pound sack below it on the same shelf. Don't buy dozens of tiny yogurt cups if you can get a kilo bucket and portion it out as you go. But if you don't typically eat enough yogurt to consume that kilo before it goes bad, consider a size somewhere in the middle, get the kilo and split it with a friend or family member, or make your own in glass. These are just examples; your shopping habits will vary.If you have more time and opportunity, you can start the process of finding like-minded folks and order food in bulk directly through various companies, splitting it with other families or storing it in a cool, dry place free of pests in your home. You can even create your own bulk food-buying co-op or start a farmer's market or community garden.Make your own outside (hot composting), make your own inside (vermicomposting), or look for the nearest community/school garden. You can also work with other local groups and community leaders to see if such a service might be implemented where you live. If you live in the US, you can also contact your County Extension service to see what your options are. See below for more resources.No! There are plenty of zero or nearo waste options out there. See below for suggestions. You can also take this time to re-examine how many beauty products you really need vs. how much you've just been psychologically manipulated by marketers (it is a multi-million dollar industry, after all. Those companies wouldn't spend all that money if they weren't getting results by exploiting our insecurities.) We're all made differently, and it depends on what your scalp and skin prefer. Some people find a lot of benefit, some people find it damaging. It is worth trying out to see if it works for you.The benefits of going nopoo are 1) reducing waste from both the product and the process of creating commercial shampoos, and 2) a more natural method for the sake of your hair's health. When you go nopoo, you're no longer buying and discarding plastic bottles of shampoo and conditioner. You're also no longer using products that are the result of many ingredients, which are the result of many processes, shipped from many places. You're also avoiding exposing your hair and body to the .The human body has systems in place for maintaining itself, and creating oil is that for hair. Over-production of oil is usually the result of shampoos stripping ALL of it from your hair, causing your scalp to overcompensate for the loss. While nobody wants oily-looking hair, a little bit of natural oil is a good thing - it helps to keep your hair healthy, strong, and moisturized. The various methods people have found to go nopoo function to keep your scalp's pH balanced (prevents overproduction of oil as well as keeping dandruff in check) while not stripping away all the natural oil. The gentle acid from lemon or high quality apple cider vinegar removes any alkaline residue from the shampoo or baking soda and brings the scalp pH back to a healthy slightly acidic level.NOTE: Everyone's body and hair is different, and what works for some may not work for others. I recommend experimenting with ones that seem the most appealing to you, giving them a few weeks to see the true results - there will likely be a transition period as your scalp reacts to the changes. But if one of them doesn't work, don't get discouraged! There are other options to try :)Zero waste isn't about perfection, and one can never truly create no waste whatsoever. Any reduction is noble and should not be looked down upon. We are all taking the steps we can, when we can, based on our personal priorities and life circumstances.Greenwashing is when a company or organization spends more time and money claiming to be \u201cgreen\u201d through advertising and marketing than actually implementing business practices that minimize environmental impact. It\u2019s whitewashing, but with a green brush. Check  for more details or  for things to look out for.One of the most successful targets for reducing personal waste is in transporting items.Plastic shopping bags can be replaced by reusable cotton or hemp bags are often available for purchase or for free as promotional items. Alternatively, many take old cloth items (e.g. T shirts) and convert them into drawstring bags. These bags can be washed and reused for years and years.Similarly, produce bags can be replaced by thin cotton or mesh bags. Some make their own from bulk lightweight fabric or from pillowcases.Don't forget that plastic bags themselves can be reused! In fact, if you are not yet convinced that you will be able to sustain a zero waste lifestyle, plastic bags have the least environmental impact per number of times used (in contrast to cotton or canvas bags) Make it a habit to keep these bags in your vehicle of choice, or right near your doorway so you don't forget to actually use them.In addition to shopping, many find carrying an extra container for (un)expected acquisitions helpful, for example, a container for leftovers from a restaurant. Some choose a glass jar; others opt for metal or plastic. As always, convenience is the top priority in making it a lasting change.Eating is the other big waste-producing event of our daily lives. It can be challenging, but here are some suggestions for keeping that waste to a minimum:We all drink. If you don't have a water bottle and/or vacuum bottle by now, it's time. Stainless steel is most recyclable, plastic thereafter, glass if you're careful. Of course, reusable cups or mugs work, too, if you spend a lot of time in one place.Keep a set of reusable dishes and cutlery handy at work and/or on the go. Some buy specialty items for this purpose, but that needn't be so.If you're human, one of your most vulnerable moments is when you're hungry. To cut down on those frenzied, impulse-buys, start carrying around a small container of dried fruits or nuts - or anything that will last and can give you the presence of mind to find a zero waste option.The challenge of zero waste eating is more complicated when you eat out. You'd be surprised, though, at how many vendors are willing to serve you on your own gear. All you have to do is ask, and the worst that can happen is that they'll say no (and/or look at you like you're nuts.) Of course, many people will avoid sit-down restaurants and to-go stands altogether. It takes a bit more planning but is certainly a manageable step on your path to a zero waste lifestyle. Consider reducing or eliminating animal products from your diet, especially beef. Animal products are among the most damaging food choices, and make up a large part of an individual's environmental footprint.As a final note, most of us use paper throughout the day either in the form of napkins or tissues. A handkerchief's value can never be underestimated.Thread : Host zero waste get-togethers and holidays, asking your guests to support your efforts to limit waste.Get your kids started out with zero waste habits and values by teaching them to pack their own lunches and take care of their belongings. For those family members who love showering your child with gifts, be firm in asking that they limit gifts to special occasions and to items that your child will use and value.If you don't want kids and feel pressured by family or friends to have them, you can add the huge amount of waste typically produced by young children to your reasons against. (See below for ideas on zero waste parenting.)Potlucks with friends can be a great substitute, in lieu of going to restaurants.Meet your neighbors and start a community garden or compost pile with your new friends.Community potlucks where you trade recipes can also be fun and informative.You can always look into carpooling with your neighbors. Find a friendly neighbor who works close to you, at around the same times that you do.You can also set up , to swap books you no longer want or need. You can also donate books to your local libraries.Talk to local coffee shops about creating a \"need-a-mug, take-a-mug/have-a-mug, leave-a-mug\" shelf to help reduce disposable cup waste. (Think of all the unused mugs sitting in cupboards at home.)You can  to paper towel holders, toilet paper dispensers, and other paper products (note that you can either purchase these, or use the graphic to make your own.)Local coffee shops are a great place to pick up free coffee grounds for community gardens.Plain, brown corrugated cardboard (with any stickers and staples removed) can be great for community gardens, as a biodegradable weed block. Newspapers, which in the US all use soy-based ink, can also be used for this purpose. Composting takes no energy compared to recycling, which is energy and water intensive.Talk to your preferred grocery store about providing packaging-free bulk items.Farmer's markets tend to love it when you show up with your own bags!Help organize and host a Participate in the voting process and purpose initiatives to help the climate. Things like plastic bags bans, carbon taxes, mandatory recycling and composting are just some thing to think about getting started in your area!You could also think about volunteering for the food bank to get more people and businesses donating unwanted food to reduce food waste. Another option is , which is an online food sharing app to reduce food waste. You can also join local community gardens. Volunteer groups don't usually demand much knowledge or skill, what they really need are people who actually show up and help out.Check out what items local charities and nonprofits have constant need for. If you ever run across those things - especially if someone is about to toss them in the garbage - you can get them to helpful people who need them most. For example, many animal rescues can use clean towels, rags, sheets, and blankets, regardless of how ugly they might be. Some cat rescues need ping pong balls and small cardboard boxes. Some dog rescues need peanut butter. Many non-profits would also love to have old but still in good working order: computers, laptops, and printers.Be visible with your zero waste habits! Nobody likes smugness, preaching, or condescension, of course, but letting people see what you're doing and graciously answering their questions is a great way to get others thinking about their waste.Threads : , , ,  - influence from the insideVolunteer to set up a small bin and take organic food scraps (e.g. apple cores, coffee grounds) to be composted. Most community gardens would be thrilled to have your compost! Just ask beforehand.Volunteer to collect items for Terracycle recycling.Identify disposables that have reusable alternatives (e.g. reusable pipette tips in a lab), and push your workplace to make a change. It can help to have numbers in hand - many times the reusable alternatives are more expensive. Knowing by how much more expensive it is can help you make your case. Point out that by moving to these practices, your company can mention it in marketing, so there's a social payoff to the greater expense.Things to consider at your workplace - using post-consumer recycled paper for printing things and for packaging (also paper towels, toilet paper, and tissues.) Moving away from instant one-use coffee things to a communal coffee pot. Setting up recycling at work. Encouraging carpooling among coworkers. Bring food from home instead of going out to eat. If someone at work is super friendly and an incredible cook, you might be able to arrange it to where everyone chips in to that person, and they bring in bulk meals for everyone, maybe one day a week.See if you can encourage your company to have more telecommuting options, and to cut down on business traveling, by better use of technology. The older generations may not be fully aware of current software and options. Flying, in particular, is very polluting and wasteful - and business travel makes up a huge amount of flights. Help set up carpooling at work.Threads : , ,  , ,   - influence from the outsideThe best way to influence the corporate world is by regulation. They hate this of course, but that's why we jail litterbugs but corporations still make (and dump) ridiculous amounts of stuff and have terrible packaging, many of which cannot even be recycled. . Unfortunately this is hard for the average person to influence, so you'll want to work with other like-minded people to bring about these big substantial changes. Boycotts don't work that well, but any campaign that can go viral and hurt (or help) the brand identity of a company can sometimes... sometimes... have an effect on corporate behavior and policy. Usually this is only temporary though.Support companies and brands that you like, and you think that are doing good things.Threads : , , This wiki is community-driven and we rely on your help to keep this information up to date!

I keep a large container in my freezer and put all my veggie scraps into it when I\u2019m cooking. Once it\u2019s full I throw the contents in a pot, add water and a few seasonings and simmer it for about two hours. I strain it, (compost the bits), and store it in the freezer in several sizes. One or two cups can be used to flavor rice and larger amounts are used as a base for soup. It\u2019s also much cheaper than buying it and I can control the sodium level.Yes! I love making homemade veggie broth too. \ud83d\ude42I love this post!! I am doing or in process of switching over in most of these categories. It was your bidet article that influenced me to make the switch a few months ago, and I love it!! My friends think I\u2019m weird, but I know it\u2019s they who are missing out.Yay! This makes me so happy!! It seriously is life changing.I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t say anything about \u2018un-paper towels\u2019 ugh! My generation calls those dish cloths and fabric napkins. I used cloth diapers as much as I was allowed to. My girls went to daycare where they required disposable diapers. I would put them in cloth diapers as soon as I got to the daycare center for a comfortable ride home. 100% cotton is better for their skin. Sewing is also very sustainable. When I lose a button and know that I will never match the buttons on a blouse or dress, I look at high end clothes to see what kind of buttons are on a similar item. I head to the fabric store to update my clothes instead of discarding and buying new.I love your list! These are great selections. Many of them are my favorites, too, (what\u2019s not to love about French press organic fair trade coffee?)I don\u2019t have the bidet attachment but i have been considering getting one. Some girlfriends of mine have one in their apartment and the love it!One of my favorite tools is a steel thermos, or actually i have several depending on the situation. Eating lunch away from home usually generates so much trash, so i pack my own. I have a thermos for coffee when its just me, a larger one when its my husband and I, and two wide mouth thermoses of different sizes, one with a folding metal spoon, for soup or hot meals. I know it sounds like a lot, but they all get a lot of use, and have saved a lot of disposable lunch ware from carry-outs, as well as a lot of money!My favourite swap is my reuseable make up remover pads. We also use face cloths instead of napkins.I make cowboy coffee. Tastes better, minimal equipment. Tablespoon of grounds in a cup, pour boiling water in to full, stir, wait 3 minutes, stir again. The grounds get saturated and sink to the bottom. Been doing it for years, and I don\u2019t ever get grounds in my mouth. I\u2019ve never used a straw for drinking, I just drink out of a plastic bottle. There\u2019s no leaching, as HDPE is inert(Polymer Chemist), and they last a long time and are recyclable. I hike, so a glass or stainless bottle wouldn\u2019t work. Both are too heavy, and glass is fragile.Bamboo toothbrushes seem to clean better, and are lighter than plastic ones.Great list! Thanks. I would add a reusable bag, a fold able tote basic but worth reminding reader about this small item.Bar of soap for handwashing, bar of soap for showering and shampoo bar!! I switched few years ago and I don\u00b4t miss showering with liquid soap at all! I also love my deodorant in carton package!We recently switched to bamboo toothbrushes and I feel a lot better about not sending all that plastic to the landfill. I also switched to bar shampoo, conditioner and soap, and I\u2019ll never go back! Now I\u2019m just working on getting my husband on board because he\u2019s pretty resistant to change.I\u2019m very happy with Sea Pearl sea sponge tampons. They are reusable and biodegradable. I\u2019ve been using them for five years and would not go back.Heads up: if you have any reason to think you might have a shellfish allergy you might want to check with your doctor before using these. My mom has a scallop allergy and I\u2019ve always thought they smelled gross, low and behold it might be for a reason because these tampons gave me an immediate very scary allergic reaction. I know lots of other people who love them though!I\u2019m a 15 year old and I started using a menstrual cup. I use to have massive cramps and now they\u2019re almost gone. I hated that feeling of leak everytime I\u2019d wear a pad and I was so scared of getting a menstrual shock that everytime id use a tampon, I\u2019d change it every 2-3 hours. Menstrual cups are amazing. Would never go back.1.Carry plastic shopping bag in purse. Use daily for everything\u2026Bring stuff in out of car, grocery store, pharmacy, Library, anything.2. Glass or stainless straws (carry in bag next to shopping bag)3. Preserve toothbrushes, from all those yogurt cups4. Mason jars for everything5. DIY health and beauty (stored in mason jars!)I\u2019ve switched to using shampoo bars more specifically the ones from LUSH! They smell decadent, they lather up, moisturize the hair, and you can get 80 to 100 uses from them! Doesn\u2019t get any better than that!Bringing reusable bags not just to grocery stores, but EVERYWHERE I go shopping!Also, menstrual cups!I, like Lc, carry fold up bags in my purse\u2026light weight and take up no room then I don\u2019t have to rely on my memory. Recently when my daughter gave me a set of stainless steel straws I kept forgetting them so made a cloth case for them but expanded the idea to include slots for 2 spoons, 2 forks, 2 knives so there\u2019s a set in each vehicle for my husband and I to use when there\u2019s only plastic ware to choose from. Included a small flannel bag for used utensils. We\u2019ve been surprised how often we use them!Now this is what I call fine material. This lets you know that there are still good subject material publishers on the web. Thank you for these ideas they are really great!Here in FL, we might wear a lot of flip flops. Since I swim often, the bottoms get smooth and slippery. I cut them up and use them in the bottom of flower or herb pots for drainage.My favourite swap has been using a dob of aqueous cream on toilet paper instead of moist wipes (toilet ones!). I developed a nasty skin reaction to the wipes and my GP suggested this as an alternative. A big tub (500gm) is equivalent to 10 packets of wipes so it\u2019s both biologically and economically god practice, not to mention kinder on my (ahem!). No idea what aqueous cream is called in the use but it\u2019s the ingredients are30% Emulsifying ointment, 15% White soft paraffin and 0.6% liquid paraffin.Oh, and by the way, I\u2019ve not drink tea or coffee for around 30 years because I simply don\u2019t like it! And I also dislike tap water. Go figure!I find there are some typos in my post1. No idea what aqueous cream is called in the States2. economically good practiceI have stopped using shampoo all together .. I\u2019m using this herbal hair mask that comes in paper packaging I mix it with water into a runny paste use it as a mask in my hair leave it for twenty mins and rinse it out that\u2019s pretty much it ! I use organic coconut oil the next morning in my hair leave the oil in my hair for a week and do the same mask again ! I dont use soap either I just use an organic herbal bath powder from the same brand !and I just mix a little with water and use it as a face and body cleanser !! I love this brand !! its an indian based company its called vaseegrahvedhaLoofah sponges to do the dishes and rashguard for swimming (less use of subscreen).Love these great zero swap ideas. I had never even thought of using a French Press to make tea but I think that is so creative. Also love Thinx and use them myself. Great post and thanks for sharing.From Laurel Christine at I love all of these \u2013 do you have a Canadian version by any chance?

You know I love Arbor Teas  and I\u2019m going to hit all the high points with a bullet blitz! BULLET BLITZ.The average American throws out 4.4lbs of trash a day, and that\u2019s not even the half of it for everything that we throw away on average 70% is lost in the manufacturing.We only see 30% of the trash made!THAT\u2019S INSANE.\u00a0Buying less is the number one thing you can do to produce less trash.\u00a0Before buying anything make sure you really truly need it. I always ask myself a series of questions.Do you really need it?Is it really necessary?Can something else make do?Do you need to own it?Zero waste is not just about the  It\u2019s also not solely about the landfill.Trash is really just a physical representation of misallocated resources.\u00a0I always say, very rarely do we have waste problems \u2013 we have creative thinking problems!Have you heard of ? It\u2019s a day on the calendar that marks when we\u2019ve consumed all of the resources the earth can sustainably produce for the year, and it came at the beginning of August last year.That\u2019s BAD.We\u2019re using 1.5 earth\u2019s worth of resources.It\u2019s completely unsustainable. So, the best thing we can do for the planet is to buy less.\u00a0However, there are still purchases we need to make.If you don\u2019t live completely off grid/are self-sustaining, you\u2019ll need to make some purchases.So when you do purchase something, really think about its full life-cycle.Think about where it came from and where it\u2019s going after you\u2019re through with it.\u00a0Here are a series of questions I like to ask myself when making a new purchase.Ask a friend.Can you find it second hand?Can you find it local?Who made it?Is it made to last/ can it be repaired?What happens when you\u2019re done with it?Always check the secondhand market first and if you\u2019re going to buy something new make sure you\u2019re taking everything into consideration.And, whatever you do don\u2019t settle.\u00a0If I\u2019ve learned anything in two years of zero waste living, it\u2019s that settling for something your not 100% happy with inevitably means you will be  with it.Then you\u2019ll look for something else which is a waste of money and time.\u00a0So whatever you buy, just make sure that you .\u00a0We live in a world full of constant advertisements that tell us we\u2019re not enough.They tell us in order to be happy or be loved we have to have this product.That their product will solve all of our problems. That it will make us happy or loved \u2013 which of course\u2026 we logically know isn\u2019t true.But, advertisers are really good at manipulating our subconscious so one of the most rebellious and radical things you can do is to simply find contentment with what you already have.\u00a0One of the best ways to do that is to practice gratitude!Things don\u2019t define you. They don\u2019t give you worth. Instead of buying things to make you look better or cooler, try spending time bettering yourself.Take a class, learn a new skill, focus on self-improvement.\u00a0So many studies have been done that people who opt for experiences instead of things are generally happier.And, like you\u2019ve heard on this blog a hundred times before, it\u2019s not about perfection it\u2019s about making better choices.\u00a0Personal sustainability is super important check out the post I wrote about it \u2013 . It\u2019s one of my favorite blog posts I\u2019ve ever written.\u00a0The thing is, we live in a perfect zero waste society instead we live in a world where things are designed to be thrown away.Check out this post if you\u2019re interested to learn more about the.Things aren\u2019t going to go our way 100% of the time and that\u2019s OK. All we can do is the best we can where we are.What would be some of your tips for someone starting a zero waste life?\u00a0Love the last tip especially! I find when chatting with people about \"zero waste\" they think it\u2019s totally impossible for them because they\u2019re taking the name literally! Zero waste is not zero! There needs to be a lot of grace for yourself during the process!Yes, very true!Great tips! Zero waste is a journey!Yep, it\u2019s not a change you\u2019re going to be able to make overnight.This simple tips are great! I really needed something like this, because I was getting frustrated after my few first zero waste attempts.I live in Spain, in a city where even bulk stores require you use their plastic bags, garbage must be disposed in plastic bags (by law), and there are no organinc bins or any form of comunitary compost (I guess I could try composting at my flat, but preliminary research shows that I\u2019d have to get rid of my compost on a public park in the dark of night\u2026 not fun, and possibly illegal).So thank you so much for all the posts you write about little things to do that help the environment, even if we can\u2019t be perfect. \ud83d\ude42I have had several people from Spain mention this. You should all get-together and form a zero waste council to try and motivate your country to encourage less waste.\"Trash is a physical representation of misallocated resources.\"Well said!Thanks!I\u2019m nowhere near trying to get all my trash in a jar, even though we\u2019ve been working on reducing it for several years. We\u2019ve given up lots of things in that time, and not missed most of them. But we still generate about one pound of kitchen trash, all of it some form of plastic, every month. Then there\u2019s the bathroom trash. Some things may have to remain one-use for the rest of our lives, although I keep experimenting with alternatives. No one here likes blowing their nose on hankies when they have a cold, and I don\u2019t like washing them. That\u2019s one example. I won\u2019t go any further!Overall, this effort is incredibly frustrating for me, especially when my soul mate doesn\u2019t feel so mated in this endeavor! : )It sounds like y\u2019all are doing a great job, and you can compost those paper hankies. \ud83d\ude09Make sure to check out some of my posts on relationships when lifestyles don\u2019t always align.Hi, Thank you for very useful tips fore zerowaste lifestyle. Me and four other students from a Finnish university are hosting a website of giving tips for easy yet effective changes you can do in your life for becoming more green. Your blog is truly inspirational. If you like, check out our page and give us feedback \ud83d\ude42 Thank you! I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re helping to spread the zero waste message!Excellent tips. What strikes me the most is #1 \u2013 Buy less. I\u2019ve been doing this when I decided to become more frugal. Now I have another reason to this, and that\u2019s to reduce waste.One tip I might share is for us to really understand why we\u2019re doing this. I\u2019ve observed that for some people, they\u2019re doing this because others are doing it as well. Then there are those who only do it whenever they remember doing it then post it to social media. Well, there could be more reasons but I do hope we could all focus on the main reason why we\u2019re doing this and that\u2019s because we care for Mother Nature. Once we\u2019ve set our mind on it, I believe things will just come naturally.That\u2019s a great tip! Getting to the heart of why we want something is very important.Hi Kathryn, this post really breaks the big mammoth of going zero waster into very easy, accessible steps. I spent all of last week searching for a laptop case. I looked for cases that were made out of recycled materials or had been upcycled. I reached out to online manufacturers to see how their products were made, I scouted Amazon for their used cases and still didn\u2019t find a case that was protective enough or that felt like \u2018me.\u2019 Eventually I caved and brought a new case which was frustrating, but I did everything I could to find a zero waste solution. I especially appreciate the point you made about \u2018not settling\u2019 because if you settle, you without doubt will be unsatisfied with your purchase.It sounds like you made the best choice you could! And, since you\u2019re looking for something so durable I hope it will last forever. \ud83d\ude09I see them all the time at second hand thrift stores for a buck. No they are not made from natural products but isn\u2019t it still better to reuse one already discarded (in new condition) than buying a new natural one? It scares me that people now seem to buy all new stuff to have the look of being natural\u2026like bamboo flatware, why not just get a set of metal for a buck second hand instead of new,shipped bamboo?My parents were newlyweds in 1930. There was no such thing as waste those days and they lived that way all their lives. My sister and I continued their life style and I still try to reuse what others consider trash.Just became aware of the Zero Wast Movement. Trying to do without paper towels, paper napkins etc. Just curious, what do I use to drain bacon, fried chicken, etc.?I personally use newspaper, or any brown paper bags I have\u2014 the grocery store I go to offers paper instead of plastic. I realize that paper can be problematic as well, but I see it as something that I can at least use for multiple purposes, and then add to our food waste bin for city pick up afterwardsIt\u2019s crazy to think about how much waste each of us produces in just a day! I\u2019ve definitely fallen into the idea that in order to be sustainable and eco-friendly, I need to replace all the plastic things I own with counterparts made of bamboo, metal, or whatever else, if for no other reason than to give off the appearance of being zero waste. In all actuality, that mindset creates more waste than just keeping the old stuff does, even though the old stuff is made with harmful materials. I\u2019ll definitely keep this post in mind the next time I think I need to buy something new.I feel like this is so true. Rather then use the plastic things we already own until they are no longer functioning, we get caught up in the \u2018eco-friendly\u2019 replacements. The most effective thing to do is not buy anything additional. I\u2019ve been reminding myself of this with my car and clothes often.Loved this post! While there are many how-to guides on zero-waste living, this one sheds light on the underpinning of zero-waste lifestyle.My advice for beginners goes something like this: start small; don\u2019t try to accomplish everything at once; sidestep zero waste guilt and move forward.Your email address will not be published.

There are lots of actionable steps you can take to save the planet from an ever-changing climate. Here are five ways to reduce your carbon footprint.Going zero waste is a great step towards combating climate change. Practicing the  can help. You\u2019ve probably heard of the three R\u2019s: Reduce, Reuse and Recycle. But there are two more that are equally important. Lets break it down: Avoid single use plastics and paper products by saying no thank you, opting for reusables.Downsize what you purchase, opting to be more mindful of what you really need. Always find a way to keep an item out of the landfill by keeping it in great condition, repairing or upcycling it when it breaks. Set up a  for your food scraps, or find a food scrap drop off center (like a farmers market, or community garden) near your house. Properly recycle any plastic, , glass or  that comes into your life you cannot refuse, reduce, or reuse by researching your state\u2019s recycling laws.Zero wasters do their best to follow these 5 R\u2019s as closely as possible. For more tips on going zero waste, check out .Traditional cars put out a lot of exhaust, which pollutes the air. In fact, vehicles produce one-third of all U.S. air pollution.The toxins emitted by vehicles are also very dangerous for human health, considering the tailpipes are at street level where humans can breathe the air directly into their lungs.Challenge yourself to drive less and bike more. Riding your bike forces you to utilize your own muscle power.You\u2019ll get a workout all while helping the environment. Plus, it requires much less energy to produce a bike than it does to manufacture a car.If you can\u2019t bike to work for whatever reason, take public transportation. It puts less cars on the road, which reduces the amount of exhaust filling the air at once.And, try to save flying for truly special occasions! Check out the tips for and make sure to purchase carbon offsets.Reducing your water usage is essential: There\u2019s only so much water on this earth, and we can\u2019t make any more of it.Did you know 96.5 percent of the water on earth is too salty for human consumption? Two thirds of the remaining fresh water are locked away in polar ice, glaciers, and permanent snow.Melting it won\u2019t help, seeing as most of it will just end up as sea water. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to cherish the water we have.Here are a few ways to help conserve water and protect our waterways:1. When you brush your teeth, be sure to shut off the water while you lather up. Don\u2019t leave it running: Only turn it on when it\u2019s time to rinse your mouth out.2. Take shorter showers. A fun way to do this is by listening to a 5 to 10 minute song, then shut the shower off when it\u2019s over.3. Don\u2019t flush things down the toilet to dispose of them. One flush can waste up to 5 or 7 gallons of water!4. Avoid dish/body soaps filled with toxins. Conventional dish and body soap contain ingredients that go down the drain and only further pollute our water supply.Make the switch to .5. Host or join a waterway . Keep those waters plastic free!6. Opt for reusables. Lots of disposable items take gallons of water to make.For example, one roll of toilet paper takes 37 gallons of water; A single disposable diaper takes 144 gallons of water.There are several other products, like paper plates, cups and towels, that gallons of water to make as well.That\u2019s why switching to reusables will help you save water in the long run.I love eating seasonal foods! Whenever I go to the , I\u2019m amazed by the bounty mother nature has to offer with each passing season. All the produce is at its peak, so it\u2019s absolutely delicious.Try to buy the majority of your food as local produce. Animal products are much more intense as they require more water and resources.Making the majority of your plate plant-based foods, is healthier and better for the planet.Eating seasonal also means eating local, which is great for the environment. When you support local farmers, you don\u2019t have to worry about how far your food traveled to get to you.It doesn\u2019t have to sit in traffic for days, spewing exhaust fumes into the air. It gets to you quickly, without polluting the air.Check your local farmers market to see what foods are in season near you. Get to know the farmers there and feel free to ask them about their farming practices.Better yet, bring some reusable produce bags and totes with you to reduce waste! The U.S. gets 81 percent of its total energy from oil, coal and natural gas (in other words, fossil fuels). These fuels heat our homes, run our cars, and provide us with electricity.However, fossil fuels are limited, finite resources and just the transportation of them alone can cause air pollution. When the fuels are burned, they emit toxins that speed up climate change.There is good news though! You can help stop our reliance on fossil fuels by switching to sustainable energy today. There are so many amazing, innovative ways to source energy in this day and age.Solar and wind power are just a few (though, by far the most common): There\u2019s also water and geothermal power to consider. This is the most expensive option, but a good one if you feel you can make the investment. Talk to a professional and a trusted company before making the leap. Your own utility may even offer installation. This is a lot more feasible if you\u2019re on a budget. Or don\u2019t have a suitable roof.The solar farms are remote and don\u2019t require you to install anything on your property. In return, you\u2019ll see savings on your energy bill over time. Many utilities are beginning to offer programs that will help you reduce your energy usage, and save a buck.See if yours offers any you can take advantage of.No matter what you decide to do, using less electricity is always the best option.Invest in more energy efficient products (I personally only buy products with the energy star logo on it), and make sure to shut off lights when you\u2019re not in a room. Pull plus out when not in use too. When it comes time to buy a new car, instead of buying a traditional car, why not buy electric? If it\u2019s too out of budget, consider buying a used EV or hybrid instead.If you liked this post be sure to check out What are some ways you plan on reducing your carbon footprint?Ariana Palmieri is the founder of\u00a0,\u00a0a blog dedicated to zero waste living and sustainability.

Eating seasonally is also the best way to reduce plastic as typically you can get some great local fruit and veg in cardboard cartons or loose. Great post!I now work for a company called Recycling Technologies in the UK\u2026please do check us out! Because of this, I now recycle ALL single use plastics at work through our plastic processing plant. I believe we are the answer to the plastic problem going forwards.Since joining I have become even more aware of my own footprint and am preparing to start a club at work for people that want to go the extra mile, including clean-up operations in which we bring the found plastic back to work to recycle! We cannot undo the damage done to our planet but we can at least try and get a grip on plastics being produced and used today! Love your blog I only found it today and have read multiple! Thanks for being an eco-warrior and for sharing all your tips and tricks!????????????????????Amazing write up \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0fIt\u2019s mentioned briefly in the part about eating locally and seasonally, but really one of the absolute best ways to conserve water is to stop eating meat. 1 pound of beef requires about 1,800 gallons of water to produce. And although you should definitely not leave water running while brushing your teeth (which could apparently waste up to 4 gallons), refusing to eat even one hamburger would be incredibly beneficial for water conservation. I feel like that should be top on the list for that category.Your email address will not be published.      Your browser must have Javascript support enabled to leave comments.    "},

Any Wishbone fans in the house!?Since I really didn\u2019t like being outside, I spent most of my free time reading.I\u2019ve always loved reading, so when I wasn\u2019t watching Wishbone talk about great novels I was reading them.Well, I mean reading the Wishbone novels, and obviously every Nancy Drew book 14x over. But, as I got older most of my leisure reading turned into reading for school and studying.And, then I stopped reading. I\u2019m not sure when I stopped, but my life got chaotic and I didn\u2019t make time to read.Last year I reversed the trend and read 35 books!I\u2019m so proud of myself and I would love to read even more this year.I had a good mix of leisure books (still obsessed with mysteries \u2013 the Sherlock Holmes Wishbone is the best Wishbone \u2013 fight me) and environmental books.I think most of us want to read more, but without a teacher handing out a syllabus full of books / a deadline our best intentions are surpassed by more pressing day to day tasks.So, I thought it would be fun to start a little virtual book club so collectively we could hold each other accountable to actually reading the books instead of them collecting dust on our bookshelves.I\u2019m going to announce a new book every two months.I\u2019ll have a blog post, email, and Instagram announcing the new arrival.Around 6 weeks after the first book, we\u2019ll have a virtual chat where we\u2019ll get together and talk about the book.I\u2019ll ask about the biggest takeaways, things you liked, didn\u2019t like, etc!I\u2019m still looking at a few different platforms for hosting this and deciding between a chat room vs. doing a video chat.Then around 2 weeks later, I\u2019ll announce the next book. I\u2019ll send you reminders via email and my stories.All of the books will be environmentally focused!I want to read through a range of topics like food, fashion, minimalism, health, social justice, and more.The common theme of all of the books will be in their style.I promise that I\u2019m not going to give you any downers. I can\u2019t stand depressing books that offer no solutions.I honestly think books that only present the problem without offering solutions are l-a-z-y. So, we won\u2019t be reading them!I really want to focus on books that offer hope and solutions. My platform is dedicated to both of those missions and this club will reflect that.Absolutely not! I won\u2019t be selling any books directly.I will link to the books, and I do make a small commission if you choose to purchase through that link, but that is not a requirement.I want you to enjoy your book however you like, whether that\u2019s audio, digital, physical, and of course don\u2019t forget to check out your local library.The most important thing you need to do is ! I will email out all of the information so you can join the chat.When you , you\u2019ll also get access to my private Facebook group.I will put some polls in there about the book club so I can find a time that works best for everyone.I\u2019m so glad you asked!I love history and etymology, and I found this book fascinating!This book tracks the origins of the word Sustainability and how it\u2019s become used so prevalently in our modern society.The term \u2018sustainability\u2019 was first used in the 1600s.This might sound like a dry textbook read, but I promise it\u2019s not.It\u2019s really entertaining and I think it lays a good groundwork for understanding the challenges we\u2019ve faced in the past and how they\u2019re very much tied to the future.This book is all about the endocrine disruptors around us in everything from beauty products, cleaning products, and even plastic.It\u2019s a total eyeopener and really drives home how living a zero-waste lifestyle is healthier for you and the planet.I can\u2019t wait to see how this little club evolves and grows, and I really hope that you\u2019ll be joining me for book #1!Love this idea for a book club!

Well, I\u2019ve got to say you\u2019re in the right place!My entire platform is dedicated to breaking sustainable living down into a super simple step-by-step process.I cover everything from basic eco-friendly swaps to more advanced and intermediate tasks like getting involved in local government and hosting a clean-up.I started living a more eco-friendly lifestyle a little over 5 years ago, and there are a few things that I wish I knew going into this.Anytime you\u2019re creating a lifestyle change it can be a little scary! I hope this blog post encourages you to give it a try.I hope it removes any fears you might have and makes joining in more accessible and most importantly fun!At this point, I think the trash jar has mostly fallen out of favor.If you\u2019re not sure what I\u2019m talking about, it\u2019s people (like I used to be!) who fit all of their trash for x number of years in a mason jar.I think most people recognize it for the gimmick it is.I\u2019m not saying it can\u2019t be inspirational, but it\u2019s certainly not always accurate.You can read more in my blog post .Using a mason jar as a trash can is unrealistic for most people.All it does is make you feel inadequate when you can\u2019t fit ALL of your trash in that teeny-tiny jar. And, trust me\u2026. no matter your best efforts trash will happen.And, when you start constantly feeling bad about yourself for not achieving this unrealistic goal, you\u2019re way more likely to give up.This makes going zero waste a chore i.e. not fun. And, who wants to keep doing something that\u2019s not fun?Wanting to live more sustainably isn\u2019t a crash diet, it\u2019s a lifestyle change. So, relax.Let go of unrealistic expectations. Do the best you can and forget about the trash jar.Humans like to go from zero to 200 in 1.1 seconds. Most of us flip a switch and want to zero waste and sustainable INSTANTLY.Of course, that\u2019s pretty much impossible.I was already living a very low-waste life before I decided to make the leap to zero waste living, and it took me around three months to build systems to reduce my trash even further.These \u201csystems\u201d include things like finding where to grocery shop, actually remembering to bring my bags to the grocery store, getting in the habit of remembering my reusable waterbottle etc.All of these things are second nature at this point.I don\u2019t even realize I\u2019m doing them, but there will be a period of time where you need to build those habits.You\u2019ll also have A LOT of old plastic things you need to work your way through whether that\u2019s your current shampoo, plastic baggies, or some single-use products that you already own.That\u2019s totally OK!The most eco-friendly thing you can do is use up what you already have BEFORE you switch to a zero waste alternative.The bright side, this will save you a bunch of money. The downside, it can be challenging when all you want is that #ZeroWasteInstagramAestheticRightNow.You can read more in my blog post .Ah, yes the #ZeroWasteInstagramAesthetic.It\u2019s very appealing. It might even be one of the reasons, that you wanted to live more sustainably!And, there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with wanting to achieve a certain look.Certain things, like aesthetics, can make going zero waste more sustainable for you longterm.I have a lot of beautiful zero waste products like tiffins and bamboo dish scrubs that make me a very happy lady!But, please don\u2019t throw out all of your perfectly good functioning stuff to replace it with \u201czero waste stuff\u201d!I think this is one of the main reasons people assume zero waste living is expensive.They feel like it\u2019s just one giant shopping list of eco, hipster goods.IT\u2019S NOT. I still have my plastic toilet brushes from 8 years ago because they\u2019re in good shape!Would I love a swanky bamboo toilet brush? Yes. Will I be getting one anytime soon? Probably not.Please use what you have, and then once your item has reached the end of it\u2019s useful like, then switch to something more eco.Check out this blog post  to get you inspired!Your friends and family will probably apologize and justify everything in their lives to you. When I\u2019m out with my friends and they get a plastic water bottle they say,\u201cKathryn, please don\u2019t hate me.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve had this thing for XX years! I\u2019m not being wasteful I promise!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u2026 I\u2019m using disposable plates at my party\u2026.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t look at this! You DON\u2019T SEE THIS!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to throw this away, can you turn around?\u201dAnd, this list goes on and on. I always remind my friends that I don\u2019t care. They don\u2019t need to justify all of their life\u2019s decisions to me.When you choose to go zero waste it\u2019s your decision and your decision alone.It\u2019s important to not judge people based on what you\u2019ve decided to do for yourself. That\u2019s the quickest way to turn people off.Be you. Be genuine.Continue to hang out with your friends. Over time you\u2019ll rub off on them, and that\u2019s why tip 7 is probably the most important on this list.Remember the whole, your trash is probably not going to fit into a mason jar thing?Yeah, that\u2019s because things aren\u2019t going to go your way 100% of the time!And, that\u2019s OK. You\u2019re going to ask for no straw, and you\u2019re going to get one.You\u2019re going to pack up your leftovers into your own container but be brought a styrofoam tray anyways.You\u2019re going to say you\u2019ve got your own bags to the cashier, and they\u2019re going to give you plastic anyways.If you live with someone else or have a family, you\u2019re going to wind up with trash in your life that\u2019s totally out of your control.Things aren\u2019t going to go your way 100% of the time, and you\u2019ve got to just take a deep breath and remember that you\u2019re doing the best that you can and that\u2019s good enough!No stress. No stress. It\u2019s all going to be ok, ok?I have changed so much over the last five years of doing this. When I started going zero waste I was very TRASH focused.That was how I judged all of my consumer choices \u2013 can I avoid trash?And, I think this is a great first question to ask yourself especially if you\u2019re new to sustainable living.It\u2019s a great way to simplify your choices so they\u2019re easier to make and less complex.However, the choice that makes the least amount of trash isn\u2019t always the most sustainable one.If you\u2019re just starting out I don\u2019t want to overwhelm you with too much information.Just so we\u2019re clear, I think starting to look at things just from the trash lens is a wonderful place to start, BUT once you get the hang of it, be open to asking yourself more questions like ethics in supply chains, overall carbon footprint, end-of-life etc.Yes, there is power in one person and individual action.However, we can\u2019t rely on a few people living a ** zero waste life to change the world.Individual action is important because it shows there\u2019s demand in the market. This is VERY important.Citizens must act so businesses and politicians can .But, change can\u2019t rely on a few perfect individuals.We need system change too. We need citizens, businesses, and politicians all moving at the same time in order to create true, long-lasting change.So, if you\u2019re not perfect don\u2019t sweat it! You\u2019re doing the best you can by simply showing there\u2019s demand in the market.But, if you want to take it one step further you should absolutely check out my !Climate change is overwhelming, there\u2019s no way around it.Trying to live a more sustainable lifestyle can be overwhelming too. You will probably get overwhelmed at some point in time.I think the best thing to do is to take a step back.Take a moment, a beat, even step away! Do something just for yourself. For me, when I\u2019m feeling super overwhelmed, I order a takeout meal.I don\u2019t do it very often, but it\u2019s something that just says, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be OK. The world doesn\u2019t rely on you being 100% perfect, 100% of the time. You\u2019re human.\u201dAnd, the next day, I get back to it!Allowing myself to be overwhelmed and to not be perfect is the reason why I continue living a low waste / zero waste lifestyle.I have found the perfect balance of sustainability for me and the planet and you can read more about that in my blog post .Now, after reading all of that, I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re amped or terrified.No matter which you are, I want you to pick one thing you\u2019re going to change and truly commit to it!If you\u2019re not sure where to start, here\u2019s a list of resources I\u2019ve compiled.Check out the  Tab for a few blog posts to help you get startedTry my free  which is available via blog post or in video depending on which medium you prefer more.Grab a copy of my book  \u2013 I have over 400 blog posts which might be a little overwhelming, so I\u2019ve distilled all of my best tips into this easy to read handbook with a bunch of recipes for using up food scraps, cleaning products, and bathroom products that aren\u2019t on the blog.Watch my  which breaks down all of the zero waste basics!

It\u2019s so easy to get discouraged if you\u2019re shooting for that aesthetic zero-waste perfection. I actually just wrote a post about zero waste fails and staying positive, too, over at losttypes.caYesterday I was so discouraged \u2013 everything seems to be conspiring against me. I want to think that I can influence family to make better choices and I\u2019d love to be perfect myself! I\u2019m going to stop beating myself up for all the \u2018wrongs\u2019 I see and just keep finding the bright spots in what we are doing. Thanks for this article \u2013 it\u2019s truly refreshed my thinkingI feel like my passion overpowers my patience and I\u2019m so thankful that I have your blog as a reminder to be easy on myself.Thanks for mentioning that there are other considerations besides trash. I read a long time ago that in areas where water is scarce, disposable diapers might be a better choice than washing cloth diapers.

I get so many people asking me, what are the next steps after tackling?\u00a0Living a zero waste lifestyle, isn\u2019t like moving through a timeline. It\u2019s more of a choose your own adventure. Which is a pretty vague answer.\u00a0I\u2019ve come up with an outline of a step-by-step zero waste process, but it by no means has to go in this order. You can go in any direction you like, but for some that are struggling with next steps, I hope this helps!\u00a0The first step is being aware of the problem. If you\u2019re on my blog, I\u2019m assuming that you\u2019re aware of the problem. Long story short \u2013 we make too much trash.\u00a0Check out this post about  and this one about the .\u00a0This is all about using what you already have. If you\u2019re anything like me, when I started going zero waste I had backups of lots of personal care items.I had a lot of paper towels, napkins, tissues, and other single-use disposable items.\u00a0I had a pantry full of food, some of which was regularly passed over for more desirable items.I had a lot of things that weren\u2019t being used or serving a purpose in my life. I started to phase those items out.I started using what I had, instead of purchasing new. I intentionally planned meals to use up the odd items in the pantry with a vow to make better purchases in the future.\u00a0For more information on what to do with your old plastic when you\u2019re going plastic free, check out .\u00a0As you\u2019re phasing out old items, look to replace some of them with reusable items. The first place I tell everyone to start with is .\u00a0When looking to purchase reusable items, make sure to check the second hand market first! But, most importantly make sure that what you\u2019re buying is going to last you for a very long time.\u00a0I\u2019m always amazed that for every d.Make sure you\u2019re making a good purchase that you\u2019re 100% satisfied with.Don\u2019t buy something immediately. Take some time and think about it so you make the best purchase possible. When ever making a purchase, I always reference to make sure I\u2019m not adding unecessary clutter to my life.\u00a0The hardest part about transitioning to a zero waste lifestyle was having patience! You\u2019re not going to go zero waste in a week!\u00a0There can be this urge to throw everything out and start completely over, but that\u2019s contradictory to the lifestyle. The lifestyle says waste nothing!\u00a0Use what you have to start. To be honest with you, almost three years later and I STILL have things from my pre-zero waste life. I plan on using those things until I can use them no longer.\u00a0Zero wasters may look like they have it 100% picture perfect together, but we all started somewhere. In fact, take a look at me in \u00a0Once simple swaps have become routine, it\u2019s time to take things one step further. Take a look at what you\u2019re still throwing away and recycling.\u00a0 Start trying to find solutions for these items.\u00a0This is where you get to have fun! It\u2019s time to think outside the box and try something new. You can always try something new.If you don\u2019t like it, you don\u2019t have to keep doing it. I have. It\u2019s equally important to ecological sustainability.\u00a0When I first started going zero waste, I made my own tortillas.\u00a0If you\u2019ve been following this blog for any period in time, you know how that went. Other than, \u201cI HATE food waste,\u201d the most popular words you\u2019ll find on this blog is, \u201cI HATE making tortillas.\u201d\u00a0It was time for me to find a better solution.\u00a0I hopped on down to a local Mexican restaurant and loaded up on tortillas in my own bag. Since then, I\u2019ve found a tortilleria where I can get 20 freshly made tortillas in my own bag or $2. That\u2019s right. $2.\u00a0Sometimes, it\u2019s just about finding a better solution.\u00a0Going zero waste really is a journey. When, I started this lifestyle, I knew I wanted to avoid making trash and bringing plastic into my home.\u00a0Over the years, I\u2019ve learned so many new things. I\u2019ve learned about the dangers of . I learned more about the environmental impacts of a .I\u2019ve learned about the devastating effects of  and that we waste an.I\u2019m constantly evolving, learning, and growing. Each day I learn something new, and I learn how to do better.\u00a0No one is perfect, hence the motto of my blog, \u201cIt\u2019s not about perfection; it\u2019s about making better choices.\u201dBut, every day we have the choice to leave a positive impact on the planet, and I\u2019m just doing the best I can to make positive choices.\u00a0Keep educating yourself. Constantly keep learning and ask yourself, \u201cIs there something I can do better?\u201d Maybe the answer is no, but maybe the answer is yes!\u00a0Keep checking in with yourself. Always strive for better.\u00a0You\u2019re definitely going to notice your consumer habits changing.\u00a0The best piece of advice I can offer is to stop purchasing things for a while (not food obviously). You can take some time to examine what you need.\u00a0I stopped buying things and focused on what I already had. I started finding contentment and it was really liberating.\u00a0Stuff doesn\u2019t define us. Life isn\u2019t about acquiring more things.\u00a0Living a zero waste lifestyle has taught me about what\u2019s really important: time and relationships.\u00a0When I did really need something, I started looking at the second hand market first.Then I looked for an ethical place to make a purchase. All of the things I bring into my life are very carefully curated and bring a lot of value to my life.\u00a0It\u2019s important to get involved in your supply chain. Know where your purchases are coming from and know what\u2019s going to happen to them when you\u2019re done with them.\u00a0The concept of voting with your dollars is really popular in the zero waste movement.\u00a0Every purchase you make is a vote for the kind of world you want to live in. Make sure your purchases are supporting your values and ideal world.\u00a0It\u2019s difficult to become discouraged when you feel like you\u2019re the only one out there trying to make a difference.\u00a0I promise, you\u2019re not alone in this fight! There are a ton of people working towards a common goal. Check out this blog post with .I even have my own \u201ctop-secret\u201d zero waste group. You can join us by signing up !\u00a0Once you feel like you\u2019ve got the individual action step down, it\u2019s time to go one step further. With your local zero waste community, it\u2019s time to pick out certain businesses you\u2019d like to target.\u00a0Maybe there\u2019s a restaurant you frequent and they put straws in your drink automatically.Write a letter with your group asking that the owner instate a new policy. Instead of automatically placing a straw in everyone\u2019s drink, make straws available by request only.\u00a0Organize a documentary viewing for the local community. Host a talk at the library. Get a booth at the farmers market. Host an earth day event. Talk to teachers so they can start .\u00a0Encourage your  with some initiatives.\u00a0Start thinking about community action to help get others involved and grow the movement at the grassroots level.\u00a0One of the best quotes I\u2019ve heard, \u201cCitizens and businesses must first act so policy can react.\u201d Policy reflects the will of the citizens and local businesses. By fostering a green community and gathering like-minded individuals, you\u2019ll have some serious power to negotiate with your local government.\u00a0For more information on getting involved with your local government check out .\u00a0My journey looks very similar to the one presented here. I hit step 10 earlier this year when chosen to serve my local government. I\u2019m curious if your journey looked like this?\u00a0Have you gone through all the steps? Were they in a similar order? What step are you on now?\u00a0Loved this post. Sometimes zero waste feels like a game and you just want to win, so wasting anything feels unpleasant. So having stuff you\u2019re still going through (like lotion or the last tube of toothpaste we had in stock) feels like it\u2019s taking forever to get through it all. It\u2019s been trial and error with finding alternatives that have worked with my family to reduce our waste. My husband has only started to get into it. Using his own cup to get a softdrink at the gas station or bringing his own bag to the store or asking the cashier not to bag his items if he forgets his bags. Just like the toothpaste, we still were working our way through our toothbrushes. But they are ready for a change and he told me we needed bamboo toothbrushes. I just keep thinking that our home reducing our waste doesnt have a big impact, but maybe someone else stuck in traffic with me is doing the same things, and someone else next to them is doing something too.

{"url": "https://goingzerowaste.com/blog/the-five-rules-of-personal-sustainability", "title": "TheFiveRulesofPersonalSustainabilityGoingZeroWaste", "body": "I have five rules to maintain my personal level of sustainability. I am lazy. I don\u2019t want to spend hours in the kitchen. I don\u2019t want to spend all Sunday prepping everything in the world.And, I never, ever, ever want to put up laundry, but I do\u2026 because it\u2019s the adult thing to do.\u00a0So, where\u2019s the line between just right and too much?\u00a0Only you know your schedule, determination, and laziness factor. But, here are my rules and tips for figuring it out.\u00a0I HATE making tortillas. Words cannot even express the level of hatred I feel just thinking about rolling out tortilla dough.I cannot stand the uneven wobbly sides, the hour I spend rolling them out with a pin, and that I have to make each one individually\u2026..\u00a0If something is that unenjoyable for you, you should probably find another way. What\u2019s so awesome is this day in age \u2013 there\u2019s always another way!Go to your local Mexican restaurant for freshly made chips or tortillas. I found a tortilleria right around the corner of the famers market that sells 20 corn tortillas for $1.50, and they\u2019ll put them in my own bag!\u00a0This applies for anything that can be frozen. And, you will be surprised what you can freeze. I store baked goods in a pillow case in a freezer drawer.I store wet goods in glass mason jars. Don\u2019t overfill the jars or they will crack! Remember liquid expands when frozen.\u00a0I keep breakfast in the freezer. Whether it be energy bites, toast, waffles, pancakes, (homemade) or bagels (store bought in a cloth bag).I also store things that take a long time to cook like beans,\u00a0stock, soup, or marinara. I fill up the small sink with cold water and place the mason jar in the sink. It will defrost in about 30 minutes.\u00a0Active time must be less than an hour including clean up!\u00a0You\u2019ll be hard pressed to find a recipe on my blog that takes over an hour of active time.For special occasions, like Thanksgiving, I make exceptions. But, in general \u2013 if it takes longer than an hour;\u00a0it isn\u2019t happening. I get home from work at 5:30, and I want full bellies and clean kitchen by seven. Is that too much to ask for?\u00a0While the pasta is boiling, I typically have a double broiler on top making use of the down time. I have definitely made body butter atop of dinner.\u00a0When my waffles are in the iron, I\u2019m doing all of the dishes and wiping down counter tops. When I\u2019m brushing my teeth, I\u2019m wiping down the counter tops and cleaning the sink.I keep rags folded at the edge of all my counter tops for quick and easy wipe downs.If it has a shelf life of less than three months, I won\u2019t make it. I aim for a six month shelf life.This is in reference to cleaning products or DIY.\u00a0It is not sustainable for me to make something I need every week or every other week. That is just way too much commitment.\u00a0If you hate doing something,\u00a0it will never be sustainable.If you love doing something, it will always be sustainable.\u00a0Like, I hate making tortillas. It doesn\u2019t matter if it fits every other rule \u2013 it is not sustainable.But, I love entertaining and making elaborate spreads. Sometimes I break my rules, but it\u2019s sustainable because I enjoy it so much.\u00a0It\u2019s all about finding a balance that\u2019s right for you.If you feel overwhelmed with the DIY, too much cooking, too much cleaning \u2013 find a way to make it sustainable for both you and the environment. Find your tortilleria.They\u2019re out there. It might just take a little digging.\u00a0Have you found your level of personal sustainability? What are some of your rules?\u00a0In regard to sustainability\u2013I love cleaning with Zero Waste products. I used to hate cleaning with Clorox and other toxic chemicals. Even as a kid, I\u2019d ask my mom, \"Really? You want your child around this gross stuff?\" And I would clean with such distain as I feared bleach would splash on me.Nowadays, I take my spray bottle of vinegar and happily clean away without fear! It has definitely made it more enjoyable.Yeah, my mom never liked bleach. She refused to buy it. I love using vinegar too!! I love that I use it for literally everything.Thank you!!I have been feeling so overwhelmed recently with the thought of making EVERYTHING. I am still trying to find my groove with it all, slowly switching over but still getting store bought things as needed until I find the time/ingredients to make them. I love your mouthwash idea but can\u2019t find aloe anywhere so store bought natural mouthwash is my current compromise.I like food finding multiple uses for one thing. I was making English muffins, but it was using too much flour and too much time, and it was stressing me out. Not good! There\u2019s an Iraqi restaurant down the street that will sell me Samoon bread in my bags! I can use them for quick pizzas (I know you\u2019ll approve!), sandwich bread, and I can split one in the morning for breakfast sandwiches.I like your shelf life rule though! I\u2019m also pretty lazy, and don\u2019t want to spend all my time in a kitchen. Working towards finding a balance slowly but surely.Slow and steady wins the race! The whole time I was writing this post, I knew that my mouthwash and the aloe vera gel didn\u2019t fit the rules. Lol! But, they aren\u2019t things that I\u2019ll make consistently.Yes! I love that they\u2019ll sell it to you right in your own bag! Perfect!!I\u2019m going to have to try freezing cooked beans! I never thought of that. I agree that you need to find a balance. My kids love greek yogurt, and I have no desire to make my own or pay 4x as much for yogurt in a glass jar. My compromise is to cut back on my own personal yogurt consumption by adding some steel cut oats to my breakfast rotation. It takes a little more time to put together, but it\u2019s just as healthy, a fraction of the cost and it doesn\u2019t come in a plastic tub \ud83d\ude42 I\u2019m definitely in search of a tortilleria in Berkeley!I\u2019d just buy the biggest plastic tub you can find. Check even with mexican restaurants! Their prices were the same as the grocery store!You can make steel cut oats really easily the night before! Toast 1 cup of oats in 1 tbsp of oil for a few minutes. Add in 3-4 cups of water (depends how you like it) and bring to a boil. Turn the stove off, cover, and let sit over night. That\u2019s it! It saves me so much time on breakfast in the morning since I can just throw the pot in the fridge and it lasts for the work week.I absolutely hate shaving my legs. It\u2019s the worst thing in the world, so my rule is that from September- March, I let it grow. Extra warmth in the winter, you know \ud83d\ude1bOther than that, I\u2019m lucky that I really enjoy cooking anything and everything, so spending a few hours a day doing something doesn\u2019t stress me out. Multitasking definitely helps with cooking though! I always have Netflix on so I can feel like I\u2019m being lazy and sitting on the sofa, but then I get to enjoy warm homemade brownies or naan. It\u2019s a win win.Yes! I love listening to music or netflix when in the kitchen. Makes me feel like I have company! Also \u2013 I officially want brownies and naan\u2026\u2026 Can you imagine chocolate naan? This is a great idea. Dessert naan.I had to laugh at your tortilla comment. I made them last week and the recipe looked so easy and wonderful, and on the picture they were perfectly round and beautiful! Yeah. Right. My arms were getting tired rolling out those individual things, and then I started a guessing game with myself, \"What country is this tortilla?\" They were the strangest shapes\u2026 one came out like Germany. I do eat a lot of quesadillas though, so it is a shame that they are not easier to make that doesn\u2019t make us want to scream and cry.RIGHT!? Someone, somewhere loves it, and they\u2019re perfect every time\u2026. I love the country game. Brilliant! My tortillas often look like Wisconsin. Not a country but\u2026. you get the picture. lol.wow, my mom was totally opposite; she was the bleach queen; it\u2019s my youngest who can\u2019t handle itI love tortillas so much I have a tortilla pressAs I type this, I\u2019m working on my fifth or so hand-crocheted mesh produce bag\u2026I may have the opposite issue as you\u2013I want to make everything! As a semi-expert on the handmade it\u2019s so easy to feel like I  make everything even when it takes up far too much of my time. I love your personal sustainability rules and definitely have to come up with my own spin on them. Thank you for sharing this \ud83d\ude42This is a brilliant post! Seriously, it couldn\u2019t be more accurate ?Love this \u2013 this is so relevant! Especially when trying to explain to non-ZWers that yes, you took the time to make those cloth bags, or that pizza, but no, making everything from scratch is definitely not a necessity!Thank you so much for the information \u2013 there are certainly things I hate to do and things I love to do. I was struggling to \"conform\" and do those things I hate. So, I was about ready to give up on a number of things.Your email address will not be published.

I do.Really. The term zero is probably not the best term. It can be scary. I know. I\u2019m quoted saying as much in an article from the Guardian in 2016.\u00a0The main complaints I\u2019m hearing is that zero waste is too restrictive or that it doesn\u2019t cover enough issues like environmental racism, intersectionality, climate change, carbon footprints, etc. etc.\u00a0The thing is it\u2019s all interconnected, and wanting to live a zero waste lifestyle does in fact incorporate many of those things. I\u2019m constantly amazed how closely environmental and social problems are linked.\u00a0Recently, I attended the with \u00a0Twice on the same day in two different sessions, I heard people say overfishing is a major problem, and that the problem is exacerbated by  without appropriate labor costs the price of the fish is grossly undervalued.\u00a0If the price of fish accurately reflected all of the labor going into it, far less fish would be eaten simply because of the higher price tag. This would adjust the supply and demand.I\u2019m not saying it would solve the overfishing problem, but it would certainly be a start.\u00a0I had absolutely no idea that slavery in the fishing industry was a problem. I don\u2019t know enough about it right now, but it\u2019s just proving over and over how environmental and social issues are inextricably linked.\u00a0The other main complaint is perfectioninsm, and how no one can ever be completely waste\u2026.. um DUH.Most zero wasters have made this point over and over and over again.\u00a0\u00a0Zero waste is a goal. It\u2019s completely unachievable.The motto of my blog has literally been, \u201cIt\u2019s not about perfection; it\u2019s about making better choices.\u201d for years.\u00a0We\u2019re all human.We\u2019re all just doing the best we can and that\u2019s OK. Here\u2019s just a few of my posts breaking down the perfection complex.\u00a0All of these blog posts talk about the messy side of being zero waste \u2013 the non-perfect instagrammable side. Most zero waste bloggers have a very real and upbeat positive attitude woven throughout their posts.\u00a0They\u2019re encouraging you to do the best you can. We\u2019re never going to be perfect. We\u2019re just a bunch of people trying to have a positive impact on the planet.\u00a0A lot of people credit Bea Johnson from Zero Waste Home with \u201cinventing\u201d zero waste. While she certainly popularized it as an at home lifestyle, the term was first used in the 1970s by Paul Palmer as an industrial term.\u00a0Paul Palmer founded Zero Waste Solutions and it started by taking laboratory chemicals that were going to be wasted and instead resold them to scientists and companies.\u00a0Basically they didn\u2019t want the chemicals to go to waste so they came up with a solution to prevent it. Thus zero waste was born! (not quite)Even before that, zero waste happening. We just didn\u2019t have a fancy term for it. In fact, zero waste is super unsexy. It\u2019s depression era living or just regular living up until the 1950s.\u00a0No one wasted anything because our consumption levels were vastly different because we lived in a completely different world.\u00a0Currently everything is globalized. If you haven\u2019t read by Thomas Friedman, it\u2019s definitely worth checking out from your local library. It talks about globalization and the shift that\u2019s happening with technology.\u00a0If you wanted a new outfit in the 1930s you weren\u2019t going to be able to buy something mass-manufactured and made in Bangladesh for $15. No, you were going to buy something made close to you.You might have even bought a pattern to sew it at home. It was going to be something of quality that would last.It would be something that came from your surrounding area.\u00a0If you bought it from a store or catalogue,\u00a0the person who made it was paid a living wage. The price of the dress would accurately reflect all of these things.A new outfit in the mid 1930s cost on average $7 which would be the equivalent of spending $130-150 today. Most ethical fashion brands charge around that price point.\u00a0If every piece of clothing I owned cost $140 dollars, you can bet your bottom dollar that I would be SO picky about what I bought and I would own far fewer clothes.\u00a0It\u2019s probably why the average woman only owned 9 outfits and took much greater care of her belongings.\u00a0We didn\u2019t waste as much simply because we didn\u2019t have the means.If your grandparents are still living, talk to them.The thought of buying a product to throw away like paper towels or paper tissues was absurd. They might have adapted now, but it\u2019s certainly not the way they grew up.\u00a0People couldn\u2019t fathom spending money on items they were going to throw away. Even if they did have disposables like a brown paper lunch bag, I can guarantee you they carried it back and forth until it fell apart.\u00a0 was done just like zero wasters do it today. You would go to the store and you would give your list to the store manager.The items you were buying like sugar, flour, cornmeal, and beans were taken out of larger bags and weighed. They would wrap your groceries in paper and you\u2019d take the goods home.\u00a0This is why you hear funny anecdotal stories of people making cakes and ice cream with salt instead of sugar. It\u2019s because the bags weren\u2019t labeled. The dry goods were bought in bulk with NO labels.\u00a0While living low waste, reducing, reusing, and repairing as much as we can is awesome and amazing \u2013 it\u2019s still not circular.\u00a0Granted, appliances from the 40s, 50s, 60s, and even into the 70s were meant to be repaired. That certainly plays a huge role in it.It\u2019s when we start to get into the 80s that companies realize in order to drive more growth, the products need to be very difficult to repair and that they need to break quicker.The quicker you can break a product the quicker you can make a new sale.\u00a0It\u2019s called planned obsolescence and we\u2019ve talked about it on the blog . This is when the problem really started getting out of control.We live in a linear economy, and our earth has finite resources.\u00a0Basically we take resources from the earth, we manufacture them into products, and then we throw them into a giant hole in the ground. Living this way makes absolutely no sense. We will run out of resources.\u00a0Resources are valuable. So why aren\u2019t we doing anything with them?\u00a0Of course recycling plays a tiny, tiny role in trying to recover some materials, but it\u2019s just not the solution.\u00a0Products need to be designed with complete absorption back into the manufacturing process.\u00a0When we resume products back into the system fully, we have what\u2019s called a circular economy. This circular economy reflects nature. In nature there is no trash or waste. A \u201cwaste\u201d product like poop is actually vital to the system. It provides vital nutrients to plants.\u00a0Living in a linear economy seemed fairly stable until we started consuming at higher rates and planned obsolescence became normal. Now we\u2019re consuming at a completely unsustainable rate.\u00a0We\u2019re currently consuming 1.5 earths worth of resources each year and we have a day to mark it called Earth Overshoot Day.It\u2019s the day that we\u2019ve consumed all of the resources the earth can sustainably produce for the coming year.\u00a0We hit it on August 2, 2017 and each year the day is moved up earlier and earlier on the calendar.The problem is becoming worse and worse, so what can we do?\u00a0There are actually a lot of things we can do.\u00a0First, we can try to live a zero waste lifestyle. A zero waste lifestyle aims to live like older generations. It\u2019s using our personal lives and personal consumption habits as an act of rebellion or protest.\u00a0We focus on buying only what we need. Reusing what we have as long as we can by performing regular maintenance,\u00a0repairing, opting for non-disposable options when possible,\u00a0and purchasing second hand.\u00a0Lastly we focus on recycling and composting. The goal is to try to reduce and reuse as much as possible first.\u00a0\u00a0So, before you recycle something, can you use it for something else? Before you compost it can you ?\u00a0Is this a perfect way of living? No, of course not. Does it completely represent a circular economy? No, of course not.\u00a0We\u2019re living in a flawed system, but what it does is challenge the norm. It brings about new ideas and innovations.\u00a0We tend to forget how much power the consumer has. When enough people stand up and say, \u201cWe want circular!!\u201d More businesses are going to start looking at circular solutions.\u00a0It\u2019s amazing how many zero waste or low waste shops have popped up in the last several years simply because the demand is there! Keep demanding change, and change will come.\u00a0Trying to live more sustainably doesn\u2019t have to be rocket science. Just find a few things that work with your schedule. I always recommend people start with the  But, honestly just try something new!\u00a0Once you\u2019ve mastered one thing, then try another. It takes a lot of time, but with patience and perseverance you can make a huge impact with a few small changes.\u00a0 The next thing you can do, once you feel like you have a firm grasp on sustainable changes you\u2019ve made in your life, look for a supportive community.It\u2019s always easier to enter into activism with a . I just wrote a whole post on this subject because it\u2019s an important first step when lobbying for big change.\u00a0Then the next step is working as a local community to apply pressure to local businesses. This will be the next blog post in my series. There\u2019s a lot I want to cover here, but it starts with small business.\u00a0What can small businesses do? Maybe the coffee shop incentivizes the use of bringing your own mug.Maybe they start charging for disposable take away cups, maybe you get the grocery store to put up signs about rethinking plastic bags.\u00a0Eva from Kind Planet  in her local grocery store. How cool is that!?\u00a0It\u2019s always much easier to enact change at the local level, but eventually we have to take it to the top to the major polluters like Coca-Cola and Nestle.But, that can\u2019t happen until there\u2019s more awareness and more people power.\u00a0In order to get more awareness and people power, it has to start small. Movements don\u2019t happen quickly. They happen slowly and take lots of energy and lots of man power.\u00a0Once there\u2019s general unrest, you can start to form policy. The people must first act so policy can react.\u00a0Once again, this starts at the local level. With California\u2019s bag ban, enough counties and cities passed bag bans that it became too complicated.In order to simplify and streamline all of the bag ban laws the whole state decided on one policy.\u00a0It takes enough people at the local level with their local community to push for change. This happens city and county wide, then state wide, then nationally.\u00a0Then once the national laws go into effect, this changes the practices of the larger companies and businesses and the smaller business, then it affects the consumer. Then we start the cycle again.\u00a0For more information on getting involved in your , you can read this blog post here.\u00a0I feel that there is general unrest in the zero waste movement simply because things move slowly.\u00a0 The solution is to go local.We have to be present in our own communities. We have to be working for legislation, influencing businesses, and growing a local community at the grassroots level.\u00a0\u00a0Change is coming, and it\u2019s all thanks to you!\u00a0Each and every one of you play a vital role in this movement. It\u2019s not about fitting your trash in a jar (that\u2019s a media gimmick).It\u2019s not about winning zero waste. It\u2019s not a competition to see who\u2019s the most environmentally friendly, the most vegan, the most sustainable, or the most plastic free.\u00a0It\u2019s just about trying.\u00a0And, not everyone will be able to participate fully at all times. Some may never be able to participate, and that\u2019s OK!\u00a0It\u2019s just a whole bunch of people trying to enact change where they can and using their voice to rewrite the system. Using their voice to demand change. Using their choices and purchases as an act of protest.\u00a0I leave you with this amazing video about the circular economy. I hope you\u2019re inspired and come away with a new passion for zero waste and what it really means.\u00a0\"I had absolutely no idea that slavery in the fishing industry was a problem.\"Neither did I!!Thanks for writing about this; sometimes I consider giving up Zero Waste blogs, since I run into so much of the same info again and again\u2014 but there\u2019s still plenty to learn about how our choices affect others and what happens when we aren\u2019t looking.There\u2019s always more to learn, unfortunately\u2026. most of it\u2019s bad news\u2026I loved that you recorded the post! You actually have a very nice voice, and it allowed me to listen to it while pretending I was working, so win-win, I guess.I\u2019m so glad you liked it! I\u2019m going to try and record more of my posts.Not sure if I was on a blog about zero waste, or some advertisement site of Disney World.I loved the recording, you should make a podcast!

Every little step matters to change the wastefulness. It is just a habit and habits can be changed! And there are alternatives to corporate giants.I\u2019d like to see you do a post about a clothing swap! I hosted a few in college and turned them into potlucks or had a craft going at the same time. It was always a lot of fun and I met new people. And super inexpensive or nearly free!I bought some inexpensive dish towels (cotton not terrycloth) and cut them in half, hemmed them and now use them as napkins; I also had 3 large t-shirts that had family logos/pictures on them. I no longer wore them and just kept them for the sentimental idea. Well, I cut out the logos/pictures to use in a quilt and cut the rest of the t-shirts up and hemmed them on my serger. These are now my un-paper towels! I keep them in a large coffee can that I decorated for my counter. I had purchased a number of flannel fat quarters that I cut up and hemmed on my serger for nose wiping! I replaced my parchment paper with silpat baking sheets. I do occasionally use foil for making complete dinners on the grill but that is perhaps 2X per year! I won some silicone bowl covers that have been heaven sent. I love that they stretch to fit most of my bowls. Now when I eat out and have leftovers to bring home, I take my own reusable container. When I am at the grocery store, I tap on bottles and jars to see which ones are in glass. I have changed the brands I use (peanut butter, syrups, etc.) to get ones that are in glass. I now shop at stores that have large bulk sections for flour, sugar, etc. Two of my favorite stores have spices in bulk.Baby steps and just looking for ways to eliminate waste \u2013 especially plastic.Buying less is a great tip. It is so freeing to stop the thoughtless buying patterns. I have a new blog with some ecotips and budgeting, I\u2019ve found a good way to buy less. Stop shopping at the cheap retailer like the dollar stores or Walmart and go where the prices are slightly higher, cause it makes me think more \"Do I really need this?\" But I also try to go to local businesses because you\u2019re supporting the mom & pop shop owners and their employees instead of the CEO\u2019s of the corporations.Your email address will not be published.

You know I love Arbor Teas  and I\u2019m going to hit all the high points with a bullet blitz! BULLET BLITZ.The average American throws out 4.4lbs of trash a day, and that\u2019s not even the half of it for everything that we throw away on average 70% is lost in the manufacturing.We only see 30% of the trash made!THAT\u2019S INSANE.\u00a0Buying less is the number one thing you can do to produce less trash.\u00a0Before buying anything make sure you really truly need it. I always ask myself a series of questions.Do you really need it?Is it really necessary?Can something else make do?Do you need to own it?Zero waste is not just about the  It\u2019s also not solely about the landfill.Trash is really just a physical representation of misallocated resources.\u00a0I always say, very rarely do we have waste problems \u2013 we have creative thinking problems!Have you heard of ? It\u2019s a day on the calendar that marks when we\u2019ve consumed all of the resources the earth can sustainably produce for the year, and it came at the beginning of August last year.That\u2019s BAD.We\u2019re using 1.5 earth\u2019s worth of resources.It\u2019s completely unsustainable. So, the best thing we can do for the planet is to buy less.\u00a0However, there are still purchases we need to make.If you don\u2019t live completely off grid/are self-sustaining, you\u2019ll need to make some purchases.So when you do purchase something, really think about its full life-cycle.Think about where it came from and where it\u2019s going after you\u2019re through with it.\u00a0Here are a series of questions I like to ask myself when making a new purchase.Ask a friend.Can you find it second hand?Can you find it local?Who made it?Is it made to last/ can it be repaired?What happens when you\u2019re done with it?Always check the secondhand market first and if you\u2019re going to buy something new make sure you\u2019re taking everything into consideration.And, whatever you do don\u2019t settle.\u00a0If I\u2019ve learned anything in two years of zero waste living, it\u2019s that settling for something your not 100% happy with inevitably means you will be  with it.Then you\u2019ll look for something else which is a waste of money and time.\u00a0So whatever you buy, just make sure that you .\u00a0We live in a world full of constant advertisements that tell us we\u2019re not enough.They tell us in order to be happy or be loved we have to have this product.That their product will solve all of our problems. That it will make us happy or loved \u2013 which of course\u2026 we logically know isn\u2019t true.But, advertisers are really good at manipulating our subconscious so one of the most rebellious and radical things you can do is to simply find contentment with what you already have.\u00a0One of the best ways to do that is to practice gratitude!Things don\u2019t define you. They don\u2019t give you worth. Instead of buying things to make you look better or cooler, try spending time bettering yourself.Take a class, learn a new skill, focus on self-improvement.\u00a0So many studies have been done that people who opt for experiences instead of things are generally happier.And, like you\u2019ve heard on this blog a hundred times before, it\u2019s not about perfection it\u2019s about making better choices.\u00a0Personal sustainability is super important check out the post I wrote about it \u2013 . It\u2019s one of my favorite blog posts I\u2019ve ever written.\u00a0The thing is, we live in a perfect zero waste society instead we live in a world where things are designed to be thrown away.Check out this post if you\u2019re interested to learn more about the.Things aren\u2019t going to go our way 100% of the time and that\u2019s OK. All we can do is the best we can where we are.What would be some of your tips for someone starting a zero waste life?\u00a0Love the last tip especially! I find when chatting with people about \"zero waste\" they think it\u2019s totally impossible for them because they\u2019re taking the name literally! Zero waste is not zero! There needs to be a lot of grace for yourself during the process!Yes, very true!Great tips! Zero waste is a journey!Yep, it\u2019s not a change you\u2019re going to be able to make overnight.This simple tips are great! I really needed something like this, because I was getting frustrated after my few first zero waste attempts.I live in Spain, in a city where even bulk stores require you use their plastic bags, garbage must be disposed in plastic bags (by law), and there are no organinc bins or any form of comunitary compost (I guess I could try composting at my flat, but preliminary research shows that I\u2019d have to get rid of my compost on a public park in the dark of night\u2026 not fun, and possibly illegal).So thank you so much for all the posts you write about little things to do that help the environment, even if we can\u2019t be perfect. \ud83d\ude42I have had several people from Spain mention this. You should all get-together and form a zero waste council to try and motivate your country to encourage less waste.\"Trash is a physical representation of misallocated resources.\"Well said!Thanks!I\u2019m nowhere near trying to get all my trash in a jar, even though we\u2019ve been working on reducing it for several years. We\u2019ve given up lots of things in that time, and not missed most of them. But we still generate about one pound of kitchen trash, all of it some form of plastic, every month. Then there\u2019s the bathroom trash. Some things may have to remain one-use for the rest of our lives, although I keep experimenting with alternatives. No one here likes blowing their nose on hankies when they have a cold, and I don\u2019t like washing them. That\u2019s one example. I won\u2019t go any further!Overall, this effort is incredibly frustrating for me, especially when my soul mate doesn\u2019t feel so mated in this endeavor! : )It sounds like y\u2019all are doing a great job, and you can compost those paper hankies. \ud83d\ude09Make sure to check out some of my posts on relationships when lifestyles don\u2019t always align.Hi, Thank you for very useful tips fore zerowaste lifestyle. Me and four other students from a Finnish university are hosting a website of giving tips for easy yet effective changes you can do in your life for becoming more green. Your blog is truly inspirational. If you like, check out our page and give us feedback \ud83d\ude42 Thank you! I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re helping to spread the zero waste message!Excellent tips. What strikes me the most is #1 \u2013 Buy less. I\u2019ve been doing this when I decided to become more frugal. Now I have another reason to this, and that\u2019s to reduce waste.One tip I might share is for us to really understand why we\u2019re doing this. I\u2019ve observed that for some people, they\u2019re doing this because others are doing it as well. Then there are those who only do it whenever they remember doing it then post it to social media. Well, there could be more reasons but I do hope we could all focus on the main reason why we\u2019re doing this and that\u2019s because we care for Mother Nature. Once we\u2019ve set our mind on it, I believe things will just come naturally.That\u2019s a great tip! Getting to the heart of why we want something is very important.Hi Kathryn, this post really breaks the big mammoth of going zero waster into very easy, accessible steps. I spent all of last week searching for a laptop case. I looked for cases that were made out of recycled materials or had been upcycled. I reached out to online manufacturers to see how their products were made, I scouted Amazon for their used cases and still didn\u2019t find a case that was protective enough or that felt like \u2018me.\u2019 Eventually I caved and brought a new case which was frustrating, but I did everything I could to find a zero waste solution. I especially appreciate the point you made about \u2018not settling\u2019 because if you settle, you without doubt will be unsatisfied with your purchase.It sounds like you made the best choice you could! And, since you\u2019re looking for something so durable I hope it will last forever. \ud83d\ude09I see them all the time at second hand thrift stores for a buck. No they are not made from natural products but isn\u2019t it still better to reuse one already discarded (in new condition) than buying a new natural one? It scares me that people now seem to buy all new stuff to have the look of being natural\u2026like bamboo flatware, why not just get a set of metal for a buck second hand instead of new,shipped bamboo?My parents were newlyweds in 1930. There was no such thing as waste those days and they lived that way all their lives. My sister and I continued their life style and I still try to reuse what others consider trash.Just became aware of the Zero Wast Movement. Trying to do without paper towels, paper napkins etc. Just curious, what do I use to drain bacon, fried chicken, etc.?I personally use newspaper, or any brown paper bags I have\u2014 the grocery store I go to offers paper instead of plastic. I realize that paper can be problematic as well, but I see it as something that I can at least use for multiple purposes, and then add to our food waste bin for city pick up afterwardsIt\u2019s crazy to think about how much waste each of us produces in just a day! I\u2019ve definitely fallen into the idea that in order to be sustainable and eco-friendly, I need to replace all the plastic things I own with counterparts made of bamboo, metal, or whatever else, if for no other reason than to give off the appearance of being zero waste. In all actuality, that mindset creates more waste than just keeping the old stuff does, even though the old stuff is made with harmful materials. I\u2019ll definitely keep this post in mind the next time I think I need to buy something new.I feel like this is so true. Rather then use the plastic things we already own until they are no longer functioning, we get caught up in the \u2018eco-friendly\u2019 replacements. The most effective thing to do is not buy anything additional. I\u2019ve been reminding myself of this with my car and clothes often.Loved this post! While there are many how-to guides on zero-waste living, this one sheds light on the underpinning of zero-waste lifestyle.My advice for beginners goes something like this: start small; don\u2019t try to accomplish everything at once; sidestep zero waste guilt and move forward.Your email address will not be published.

{"url": "https://goingzerowaste.com/zero-waste-1/", "title": "AboutZeroWasteGoingZeroWaste", "body": "The simple answer: We aim to send nothing to a landfill. We reduce what we need, reuse as much as we can, send little to be recycled, and compost what we cannot.\u00a0The less simple answer: It\u2019s really about redefining the system. We currently live in a linear economy where we take resources from the earth and then dump them in a giant hole in the ground. The goal of zero waste is to move to a circular economy where we write trash out of existence. The circular economy mimics nature in that there is no trash in nature.Instead of discarding resources, we create a system where all resources can be resumed fully back into the system.Check out this blog post for a detailed look at  \u00a0The average american sends 4.4lbs of trash to the landfill every day. We live in a disposable society where we don\u2019t value our belongings, and we\u2019re consuming way too many resources.\u00a0Each year we have  to mark when we\u2019ve consumed all of the resources the earth can sustainably produce for the coming year. Earth Overshoot day was August 2nd of 2017. We\u2019re essentially consuming 1.5 earths.\u00a0\u00a0Beyond our overconsumption problem, landfills are toxic. They\u2019re responsible for 20% of the methane emissions in the US, and they aren\u2019t aerated for proper decomposition of natural materials. Toxins from cleaners, batteries, small electronics (and other items that shouldn\u2019t be landfilled) leach into the soil and can run off into the ocean and ground water when it rains.\u00a0A lot of trash doesn\u2019t even make it to the landfill. Instead it clutters the sides of roads and .\u00a0Plastic is especially dangerous to the ocean, marine life, and our health. It doesn\u2019t biodegrade it photodegrades which means it only gets smaller and smaller.Each micro-plankton in the ocean has 36 micro-plastic pieces to match. Plastic breaks down so small that it\u2019s in drinking 90% of drinking water both bottled and tap world wide.Unfortunately, no.\u00a0There\u2019s simply too much to process, and we\u2019re just consuming way too much. Recycling isn\u2019t a perfect solution. While it plays into the solution, we have to lessen our dependence. Did you know, only 9% of plastic is actually recycled?There\u2019s a reason recycle is LAST. \u201cReduce, Reuse, \u201d\u00a0Recycle shouldn\u2019t be the first line of defense, it should be a last resort. Most of our recycling isn\u2019t even processed in the US. It\u2019s processed in China, and China has put a ban on paper and plastic bales over 1% contamination. To put this in perspective, the best recycling facilities in the US are currently operating at 4% contamination level.\u00a0I\u2019m not telling you this to prevent you from recycling. I\u2019m telling you this so you can  and depend on it less. You can read more about recycle rates . Instead focus your efforts on reducing and reusing.\u00a0You don\u2019t need everything you think you \u201cneed.\u201d So many products are sold to us for a specific use. But, you don\u2019t need a separate cleaner for the floor, the windows, and the bathroom. You don\u2019t need eight blue sweaters. By reducing what we need, we\u2019re reducing what we\u2019ll eventually throw out.Before making any purchase, wait. Spend some time, think about whether or not you truly need it.\u00a0When you do need to buy something, check the second hand market first. Reuse something that already exists, and instead of using disposables focus on reusables (i.e. hankies instead of tissues.)\u00a0which will intern also reduce what you need. Check out my top \u00a0YES! Every day you have the decision to positively impact the planet. How do you get to work?\u00a0How do you buy your groceries?\u00a0What are you eating?\u00a0What are you buying? Everything is interconnected. Every purchase you make is a vote for the kind of world you want to live in.\u00a0With just one small step at a time, you can greatly reduce your footprint. But, going zero waste isn\u2019t just great for the environment, you\u2019ll notice an improvement in your quality of life. Side effects include eating better, feeling better,, and not having to take out the trash!Of course!

{"url": "https://goingzerowaste.com/page-me/", "title": "AboutMeGoingZeroWaste", "body": "This is a long story. But, I\u2019ll keep it to the Reader\u2019s Digest version.\u00a0When I was in college,\u00a0I started feeling an unbearable pain in my left breast.\u00a0It was exceedingly painful to raise my arms,\u00a0and I couldn\u2019t wear a bra. I went to the gynecologist, and was immediately set up with an appointment in the breast cancer ward to get an ultrasound where they found several tumors. Then I had a fine-needle aspiration.\u00a0Thankfully, everything was benign, but they didn\u2019t recommend operating because there\u2019s a good chance they would come back. So, the pain was something i had to live with.\u00a0The whole experience really got me thinking about what I put in and on my body. I had never considered it before; I just assumed everything I was consuming was safe. What I learned is there\u2019s very little regulation and testing for a lot of the products we buy like beauty products and cleaning products.\u00a0Many of these products contain endocrine disruptors which interfere with our hormones.\u00a0I felt very motivated to take control of my health,\u00a0try to balance my hormones, and naturally ease my pain.\u00a0I started trying to avoid unnecessary endocrine disruptors by reducing my contact with plastic, cooking from scratch, watching my sugar and caffeine intake,\u00a0making my own cleaning products, and opting for green beauty products.\u00a0And after experimenting and moving to a more holistic lifestyle, all of my pain went away. I\u2019ve been pain free now for over three years. I accredit this most closely with changing my deodorant.\u00a0I majored in musical theatre and performed professionally for several years after college. After one particular gig, I met my Justin (Spoiler alert \u2013 we got married a couple of years later)\u00a0and he asked me to move out to California with him.\u00a0When I arrived, I was shocked to see all of the litter and plastic lining the streets. We were so close to the ocean, and it all clicked for me. Plastic isn\u2019t just bad for personal health; it\u2019s also bad for the health of the planet.Health and wellness of self is so intrinsically linked to the health and the wellness of the planet.\u00a0I started my blog to help others improve their personal health, improve the health of the planet, and most importantly I wanted everyone to know their choices matter. Big or small, the changes you make add up to a huge positive impact.\u00a0Small actions done by hundreds of thousands of people will change the world.\u00a0You don\u2019t have to be perfect to make a difference, you just have to try.I still live in the bay area and somehow manage the time to do professional theatre. Some of my favortie roles since getting to the Bay have been Viola in 12th Night and Katherine in The Taming.Some of my favorite things are morning matcha, long family walks, the color orange, and pizza. Lots and lots of pizza!\u00a0I hope you follow along with me on my journey to reduce my waste. Together we will find alternatives to plastic, eat real food, and go on adventures instead of collecting more stuff!\u00a0How does that sound to you?\u00a0 Justin, my rockstar husband, who might love pizza more than I do. He is an audio engineer, and if I ask really, really nice, he\u2019ll take pictures and shoot video for me.\u00a0 Kathryn, that\u2019s me, and you just read a whole page about yours truly!

Unlike tissues, I don\u2019t find my nose chaffing after several uses.I used to hate drying dishes.My dish towels were never up to the task;\u00a0water was spread rather than absorbed.With these woven cotton cloths I can accomplish loads of chores. Dusting \u2013 you bet.Kitchen counters \u2013 a breeze. Drying dishes \u2013 absolutely!\u00a0Wrapping a sandwich to go \u2013 of course.There are so many uses for good dish towels.Have you ever left spaghetti in plastic tupperware?After a couple of hours the plastic is tinged red where the sauce has leached into the walls?\u00a0The reverse happens as well.

They\u2019re light weight,\u00a0, and you don\u2019t have to worry about them breaking.We\u2019re all very aware that plastic bottles are one of the most prevalent items in landfills.They have an incredibly low recycle rate and can only be downcycled. They will always wind up in a landfill. Here are some fun .They\u2019re also one of the easiest items to replace in your day to day life. It takes 3 liters of water to make .5 liter of bottle water.It\u2019s an unsustainable and unregulated practice. Get used to your tap water and refill a reusable bottle.There are a lot of attractive \u00a0and stainless options. You can buy a \u00a0or \u00a0for you .I found mine at a thrift store for $2.00 and ordered a shiny new bamboo cap.\u00a0\u00a0There\u2019s an overwhelming amount of plastic bags in landfills and waterways.They\u2019re incredibly wasteful and put marine wildlife in danger. It\u2019s a really easy . The hardest part is remembering to bring them with you. Try to keep them in the trunk of your car.Some stores give you cash back for bringing them, and there\u2019s no better incentive than that.\u00a0Even produce can\u2019t escape endless plastic.Spinach comes in plastic bags or boxes, oranges come in mesh, thin plastic produce bags at every corner, and stickers are stamped on every loose item.The farmers market is the best way to avoid these things. If you don\u2019t have access to a farmers market, you should bring your own produce bags and avoid prepackaged goods.It\u2019s very simple to sew your own; I used 100% cotton pillowcases from the thrift store. Or you can purchase them on.\u00a0Sponges are a magnet for bacteria, but so are rags. Bacteria like to grow in warm, damp environments.The \u00a0is the most sanitary, but sometimes it\u2019s difficult to get a brush inside of a jar.

Fortunately there are many \u00a0you can compost.\u00a0Aluminum foil was the hardest thing for me to give up.Fortunately they make reusable products that act like foil or cling wrap.

You can also use a  for lining your pans when baking at high temperatures. Ore use them for freezing.Composting is probably the most important step of all.

But I wouldn\u2019t compost them after \"good use\", so many things you can still use them for, you could use them to write the name of the herbs/veggies you\u2019ve planted, if you\u2019ve got lots of them, you could make beautiful boxes ..I used old toothbrushes for weapons cleaning, the same as I did in the Army. Works great for getting carbon fouling off rifle bolts and such.Can you recommend a brand for the kitchen towels? I have crappy tea towels that just spread the water around and I think that\u2019s why I don\u2019t use them more.I just wrote a post called 6 tips for ditching paper towels and link to the ones I have that are AMAZING!I\u2019ve switched for zero waste in 5/10 things you write about. I hope I\u2019ll go further. Thanks for this blog! \ud83d\ude42I agree with all of these ! A couple things I\u2019d add though is \u2026 recycle those unavoidable things because not everyone is in a economic position to buy milk/produce from a producer. Meat and dairy should NEVER be composted with veggie/fruit scraps!! Those items ruin the beneficial bacteria in your compost and attract unwanted pests to your compost . Some other things you could add : use mama cloth ,family cloth , cloth diapers, etc. How do you get rid of the aluminum foil for toasting certain foods in the oven ,for example cheese? Also how do you eliminate garbage bags for unavoidable waste like meat packages ? how well does the beeswax wrap keep bread ? Very curious but haven\u2019t found answers with the \"zero waste\" community. Thanks !My farmers market is leaps and bounds cheaper than the conventional grocery store. I understand it\u2019s not the same for everyone, but don\u2019t write it off. Meat and dairy are perfectly find to be composted at an industrial facility. You could toast the food just on a baking sheet and clean it after you\u2019re done. Or look into a silicone mat. I have serval that I love. You can buy meat in your own container from the butcher counter. If you can\u2019t, then it will just have to be trash. I prefer to keep my bread in the freezer in a pillow case. Besswrap should keep it well for a couple of days, but any longer I\u2019d put it in the freezer.Something else that is great to replace cling wrap are these things:They are absolutely amazing and are so easy to use. You just place them on the plate/bowl and they form a seal far better than cling wrap!Great tips might try out the toothpaste one, my rubbish removal company Get It Tidy Get It Tidy have been doing our bit for planet earth recently, we\u2019ve been giving away part broken pallets which we remove from rubbish removals and office clearances. My friends kids have been making some nice pallet furniture with it.I\u2019m trying to buy a lot on bulk stores, they are not so many or not so common in Mexico, but I\u2019m still struggling with it.I\u2019m concerned about the supply chain of bulk products\u2026 I mean: candy, chocolate, pasta, grains and even peanuts\u2026 all of them normally come packaged because of transportation and logistics. Do you care for this things too?? I mean, I\u2019m aware of the effort it takes to live ZW, but what\u2019s the point if my trader is anyway throwing away all these packages to sell me in bulk?I\u2019ve seen grocers stock bulk bins. It\u2019s typically large paper bags that are recycled. You\u2019re still cutting down on a lot of packaging! Go read my Life Without Bulk Options post which discusses this more in depth.I love these ideas, thanks for sharing! I just posted about how to start reducing your waste without spending money, I\u2019d love for you to check it out:Still something to improve\u2026aI\u2019ve already been doing these things for quite a long time, but now I\u2019d really like to achieve zero waste. So I have questions. Most of what I throw away in the garbage is plastic bags. Not grocery store bags, but bags that things come in. For example, bread, cookies, crackers etc. Bacon. Sliced ham. Cheese. And lots more. Yes, I guess I could make my own bread, cookies and crackers, but not ham or cheese! Does anyone know how to purchase cheese (for example) without some kind of plastic covering?Good question. Try washing out those plastic bags and carrying a couple of them in your shopping bag. Ask the deli person to weigh your purchase and put them in your own plastic bag. Use the smaller bags to wrap your lunch. They take up less space than you think. Then take them home and reuse. Use the big bags from inside cereal boxes to keep lettuce and big produce items fresh in your fridge. I\u2019m always looking for uses for these bags!I was wondering if you have looked into the environmental impact of the chemicals used in the recycling process. My understanding is that many of the items require the use of toxic chemicals. I\u2019m not advising against recycling; I\u2019m just saying that it\u2019s the third strategy after reducing and reusing. I buy most of my durable good on the secondary market\u2013thrift shops and eBay\u2013and I\u2019n not suffering. I would also remind folks that Chinese companies are frequently in the news for their inhumane labor practices; when we buy products from someone, we make it possible for them to continue the status quo. This is probably true of much of the manufacturing done in the Third World.I would also recommend looking at youtube videos by 5 Minute Crafts or Blossom for ingenious ways to better use the things you already have; there\u2019s even an easy way to fold fitted sheets! And store plastic grocery bags!I have a quick question! I try to heat up my foods in pots and pans as often as possible, but what material would you suggest using to put in the microwave? I use plastic containers because I know there\u2019s no risk thay the container or the microwave will be damaged, but is there a good alternative to this?I had this same thought at first, then I thought maybe just transfer to a regular plate/bowl. Glass tupperware can also usually be microwaved too. You\u2019d just have to be careful when removing it.I have a question about the silicone products: since silicone isn\u2019t recyclable, do you have plans for the end of life of your silicone items? I\u2019ve been avoiding buying these since I learned that we can\u2019t recycle them. Also, several comments have questions regarding kitchen towels not being very absorbent. I have found that using half (or less) of the \"recommended\" amount of laundry detergent (seriously\u2013using too much detergent is worse than none at all), and using vinegar in the rinse cycle instead of fabric softener, helps all my towels be very absorbent. Don\u2019t use the fragrance beads, either\u2013those have a wax in them, similar to fabric softener.Love your quest and others for any attempt at ZW. Our earth needs our attention. Handkerchiefs are good for all things except for sniffles and catching sneezes. It actually keeps the germs on your hands and it spreads germs. In fact, when we sneeze into one the germs shoot towards others at alarming speeds! It is always best to sneeze into your elbow. Check out Myth-busters on the subject and you won\u2019t use that for colds ever again. Cheers for all you do and for staying healthy too \ud83d\ude42Your email address will not be published.

I\u2019m talking about buying loose products to put in your own containers. It\u2019s an excellent way to buy an ounce of something or five pounds of something. Did you know 40% of food in US goes ? By buying bulk not only are you cutting down packaging, but you can control exactly how much of something you\u2019re bringing home. In turn you can control how much you waste.\u00a0Pre-Zero Waste days.\u00a0Bring your own container.: A process to change waste into something new. It\u2019s to reuse useful materials and give them a new life. It also reduces energy from creation, reduces air pollution from incineration, and water pollution from landfills.\u00a0: A part of the recycling process. It reduces the use of new raw materials by using the whole of an old material for a new purpose and to give it more value. Like taking an old tire and turning it into an ottoman. However, I find a lot of these projects to be undesirable or unnecessary. Depending on how the product is formed or what it becomes it may go to a landfill in the end.\u00a0: It\u2019s another part of the recycling process. Materials are broken down into component elements and they\u2019re separated based on usefulness. Some are discarded, and others are used to make products of lesser quality or value. Plastic water bottles are recyclable, but they\u2019ll be turned into a speed bump or park bench. After that product has deteriorated, it will go into a landfill. It can\u2019t be recycled after that.\u00a0: A prevalent idea in this blog that anyone can practice. It\u2019s reducing waste by eliminating it. You are stopping the problem before it\u2019s created.\u00a0This is the waste used in creating the product before it gets to the consumer. I try to take up-waste into consideration for all my purchases. Being a functioning member of society, the only way to avoid up-waste is to move to a cabin in the woods and grow all of my own food.\u00a0In this blog I focus on what I can control as a consumer.: For the purpose of this blog we are talking about things that end in a landfill or cannot be fully recycled. This has to do with  waste not up-waste.\u00a0\u201cadj.\u00a0(of a material, substance, or byproduct) eliminated or discarded as no longer useful or required after the completion of a process. noun.\u00a0material that is not wanted; the unusable remains or byproducts of something.\u201d \u2013 dictionary    "},

I\u2019m pretty excited about this little project I\u2019ve been working on. I really hope that you\u2019ll check the book out.\u00a0It\u2019s not a super long book, but it puts it in a great format for each R. It\u2019s a great place to start for beginners and a lot of the principles I talk about have their own blog posts like , , and .\u00a0To get a copy of the eBook head on over to my  page and enter your email address. After you enter your email address, you\u2019ll receive an email asking if you really want to subscribe.

What\u2019s your favorite R on the zero waste food chain?\u00a0I like reduce because I feel like it\u2019s the most zen, but on the other hand reuse has got those vintage vibes. I think vintage zen might perfectly describe my aesthetic. \ud83d\ude09\u00a0I would love to get your thoughts on the little eBook, so please let me know what you think.\u00a0Hi Kathryn!I would love to tell you a little bit about \u201cmy journey\u201d before I get into the e-book. About a year and a half ago, I decided to take a step back from my ten year job as an export Supervisor in a shipping company, to see what else was out there, and graduated from a postgraduate course in Fashion buying & Merchandising from the London College of Fashion. When I stopped working, I decided for obvious reasons, to use up absolutely everything I had in my bathroom for years, and not purchase new versions. That is, all sorts of samples accumulated, a few make up bottles half used, eye shadows, body creams, etc. On the same journey, I decided to do a clear out of the clothes I truly didn\u2019t wear any longer, and other girls could enjoy. Doing some research and found a fab app to sell my clothes, and the satisfaction of getting a notification from someone that loves your previously own dress It was such a warm feeling! On the same journey, I found an app that digitalises your wardrobe, which a massive success amongst my friends, to be able to see what you already have in your closet, and how to combine the pieces. This discovery went hand to hand with identifying what more clothes I wanted to either sell, or give away to my local charities. On the same journey, my super green friend Virginia, introduced me to the book \u201cGorgeously Green\u201d and then I purchase \u201cDo It Gorgeously\u201d from the same author, I was actually tired of spending good money in expensive face cream, and lotions to big brands over the past years, and thanks to the book, I made the fabulous face cream in the book (I have been using already my own night beauty oil for about ten years now). On the same journey, my fashion course was very honest, and it made us understand the no so pretty side of things, however the hope how sourcing is evolving and changing. This, to an admitted shopaholic, who changed her wardrobe depending on season trends, was quite a shock, and I started to buy less and less clothes, and actually make a proper use of the gorgeous clothes I already have. The more I bought, the less I wanted to buy. On the same journey, I started to read Marie Kondo and the happiness after order. So even more clear out in the house.And through my friend Virginia I \u201cmet\u201d you.I have just read your e-book, as clear and helpful as to how do I carry on with this \u201cswitch\u201d. It dawn on me: I have finished up most of the items I set out to use in my bathroom about a year and a half ago, I have switch to a natural replacement on the ones I needed, and purchased much less in the past year and a half, and felt that \u201cfreedom\u201d you talked about when getting rid of stuff.So I want to thank you, for your blog, the e-book, and your intentions.You are so sweet! Thank you so much for your kind words. \ud83d\ude42My facorite R is missing here: Repair.I\u2019m already a suscriber and have been waiting to receive an email about your ebook, but have not received one. When did you send it? I actually resuscribed and that didn\u2019t appear to work for me either. Anyway, excited to read it when I can! \ud83d\ude42Yeah, if you were already subscribed it won\u2019t send it. Send me an email through my contact form and I\u2019ll email you back with the PDF attached.Congrats on your ebook, Kathryn!

Med prednostmi te strategije so: zmanj\u0161evanje koli\u010din odpadkov (in s tem ), finan\u010dni prihranki, manj\u0161i ,...\nNi\u010d  je filozofija, ki spodbuja preoblikovanje virov \u017eivljenjskega cikla, tako da so vsi  ponovno uporabljeni. Vse  - odpadki poslani v postopke odstranjevanja so minimalne in ne vklju\u010dujejo se\u017eiganja ali energetske predelave odpadkov. Priporo\u010den postopek je postopek, ki materiale vrne v naravne cikle prsti ali materialov.  (Mednarodna Zero Waste Zveza) navaja definicjo: Zero Waste je eti\u010den, ekonomski, u\u010dinkovit in vizionarski cilj, ki dru\u017ebo vodi v spremembo \u017eivljenjskega stila in navad ter k posnemanju trajnostnih naravnih ciklov, kjer so vsi odpadni materiali surovina za nekoga drugega. Zero Waste pomeni oblikovanje in upravljanje izdelkov in procesov tako, da se zmanj\u0161a volumen in toksi\u010dnost odpadkov, ohranja ter predela vse materiale in se jih ne se\u017eiga ali odlaga. Implementacija Zero Waste bo prepre\u010dila vsakr\u0161ne izpuste v zemljo, vodo ali zrak, ki bi lahko ogrozili zdravje ekosistemov, ljudi, \u017eivali ali planeta.\nV  ta proces vklju\u010duje oblikovanje  in tradicionalnih proizvodnih odpadkov. Na primer lahko bi   steklenice . Glavni vhodni vir je - pesek, ki ga oblikujejo v kozarec in nato v steklenico. Skladi\u0161\u010da jo napolnijo z mlekom in razdelijo potro\u0161nikom. Na tej to\u010dki, bi normalna metoda odpadkov dejala odstranitev steklenice na  in podobno. Ampak z metdo ni\u010d odpadka, na\u010din lahko steklenica ob prodaji v depozit, ki se vra\u010da na prenosnika ob nakupu. Steklenico se nato opere, ponovno napolne in proda naprej. Imamo samo porabo  za pranje steklenic in onesna\u017eevanje vode, ki bi ju bilo potrebno zman\u0161ati.\nNi\u010d odpadkov lahko predstavlja ekonomi\u010dno alternativo odpadkov, kjer so za nove vire nenehno potrebni za ponovno napolnitev zapravljanja . Prav tako lahko predstavljajo novo alternativo okolja z odpadki, saj odpadki predstavljajo znaten dele\u017e onesna\u017eevanja na svetu.\nCelotna strategija temelji na t. i. sistemu 3P: Prepre\u010devanje, Ponovna uporaba in Predelava (angle\u0161ko 3R: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle).\nIzraz Zero Waste, je bil javno prvi\u010d uporabljen v imenu , Zero Waste Systems Inc (ZWS), ki ga je ustanovil  kemije Paul Palmer v sredini 70-ih v , v . Poslanstvo ZWS je bilo najti nove prostore za skladi\u0161\u010denje za ve\u010dino kemikalij, ki so se pojavljale kot prese\u017eek v nastajajo\u010di elektronski industriji. Kmalu so raz\u0161irili svoje storitve v \u0161tevilne druge smeri. Kot primer lahko navedemo da so brezpla\u010dno sprejemali, velike koli\u010dine razli\u010dnih novih in uporabljenih  kemikalij, ki so jih potem prodali raziskovalcem, znanstvenikom in podjetjem. ZWS je imel verjetno najve\u010dji popis laboratorijskih kemikalij v celi , ki so bile prodane za pol cene. Prav tako so zbirali topilo, ki so ga v elektronski industriji imenovani razvijalec oz. izpiranje (me\u0161anica  in ). Topilo je bilo dano v majhne plo\u010devinke in pu\u0161\u010deno v prodajo kot redkej\u0161i . ZWS je bil pionir pri mnogih drugih projektih.\nMednarodni ugled so si ustvarili predvsem s tem, da so bili edino podjetje na svetu, ki se je ukvarjalo s tem poslom. O samem podjetju je bilo napisano veliko \u010dlankov. Prav tako so sodelovali v nekaterih televizijskih oddajah. The California Integrated Waste Management Board je pripravila diaprojekcijo, ki prikazuje delovanje ZWS in EPA je objavila \u0161tevilne \u0161tudije njihovega poslovanja, v katerih jih poimenujejo \"aktivna izmenjava odpadkov\".\nKrovna organizacija, pod katero spada ZWS je Zero Waste Institute (ZWI), ki jo je prav tako ustanovil Paul Palmer, najdete jo na . Na podlagi izku\u0161enj iz ZWS, ZWI meni, da recikliranje ni ve\u010d samo privesek pri ustvarjanju smeti in sami industriji smeti. \nZWI prav tako zavra\u010da vse poskuse ponovne uporabe odpadkov ali uporabo vse vrst proizvodnih odpadkov. Namesto tega, ZWI poziva k prenovi vseh izdelkov iz industrije, trgovine in procesov, ki proizvajajo in prodajajo, da jih uporabijo, tako da nikoli ne zavr\u017eejo odpadkov, ki nastanejo, saj jih je treba ponovno uporabiti ali reciklirati. \nSpletna stran ponuja \u0161tevilne primerne na\u010dine, na katere se lahko oblikujejo izdelki tako, da je zavr\u017eenje nepotrebno, saj je potrebno raz\u0161iriti vrednost praga izdelka na pribli\u017eno \u010dlove\u0161ko \u017eivljenjsko dobo, 100-ih let. V celoti je izdelan sklop na\u010del in predstavljene analize. Teorija U\u010dinkovitost dizajna vodi do Uspe\u0161nosti dizajna je predstavljena, kar pomeni, da ko je izdelek namenjen za uporabo v trajnost, ga je potrebno opremiti z robustno funkcijo, trdimi materiali in posebnimi ugodnostmi, ki nam ne omogo\u010dajo da izdelke lahko zavr\u017eemo po enkratni uporabi. To teorijo se uporablja kot primer za pakete.\nZWI zavra\u010da vse povezave s svetom za recikliranje, ki poudarja, da ni nobene teorije za recikliranje, samo zaupanje in upanje, da bo to koristno.\nGibanje je pridobilo \u0161ir\u0161o javnost in doseglo vrhunec v letu 1998-2002. Od takrat se zavzemajo za prenos iz \"teorije v prakso\", s poudarkom na tem, kako je \"zero waste community\" strukturiran in kako se obna\u0161a. Na spletni strani Zero Waste International Alliance je seznam skupnosti po vsem svetu, ki so ustvarili javne politike za spodbujanje zero waste prakse. Poglejte tudi Eco-Cycle spletno stran kot primer, kako ta velika neprofitna organizacija vodi Boulder County, Colorado na Zero-Waste poti in poglejte 6-minutni video o tem. In Kon\u010dno je v ZDA zero-waste, organizacija imenovana GrassRoots Recycling Network, ki pripravlja delavnice in konference o dejavnostih zero-waste.\nObstaja napetost med dobesedno uporabo naravnih procesov in oblikovanjem industrijsko u\u010dinkovitej\u0161ih na\u010dinov ponovne uporabe. Veliko opazovalcev ima pogled na  kot na kon\u010dni model za  in inovativne . Drugi opozarjajo, da industrijski izdelki sami po sebi niso naravnega izvora (kot so  in , ki so mono-molekularni) in imajo veliko koristi od industrijskih metod za ponovno uporabo, medtem ko je degradacija geografskega okolja in priprava metode v tem okviru potratna. Najbolj znan primer je biorazgradljiva . Nekateri trdijo, da je plastika potratna, ker je draga in okolju \u0161kodljiva, ali je narejena iz  ali , v proizvodnem procesu porabi vse enake materiale in stro\u0161ke za . \u010ceprav se plastika po enkratni uporabi biolo\u0161ko razgradi, je veliko bolj pomembno, da se plasti\u010dni deli uporabijo za oblikovanje. Druga stran trdi, da je vodenje plastike iz  edina korist interesov.\nPodjetja, ki se gibljejo v smeri \u02ddni\u010d odpadkov\u02dd so v svetu , , in Anheuser-Busch. in v Sloveniji gre v to smer   \nPomembno je razlikovati recikliranje odpadkov od Zero waste. Nekateri trdijo, da je klju\u010dni element Zero waste recikliranje, nekateri pa to zavra\u010dajo in pravijo, da je le ideja. Skupno razumevanje recikliranja je preprosto, dajanje steklenic in plo\u010devink v ko\u0161. Sodobna razli\u010dica recikliranja je bolj zapletena in vklju\u010duje veliko ve\u010d elementov financiranja in dr\u017eavne podpore. Na primer, poro\u010dilo  (U:S: Environmental Protection Agency) za leto 2007 ka\u017ee, da ZDA na nacionalni ravni reciklirajo 33,4\u00a0%. Z namenom ravnanja z recikliranimi materiali, pa so bile \u0161irom sveta ustvarjene razli\u010dne . Hkrati pa so bile zahteve po recikliranju v\u010dasih pretirane, na primer odlagali\u0161\u010da smeti naj bi prekrivali z zemljo ter  vsak dan. V dr\u017eavah, kjer vzpodbujajo recikliranje, je stalno prisoten pritisk s ciljem zvi\u0161ati stopnjo recikliranja ter s tem vplivati tudi na lokalno samopodobo.\nGibanje, usmerjeno k recikliranju, se je lo\u010dilo od koncepta Zero waste. Dober primer je ra\u010dunalni\u0161ka industrija, ki po vsem svetu vsako leto zavr\u017ee milijone ra\u010dunalnikov (160 milijonov leta 2007). Ti pokvarjeni ra\u010dunalniki sledijo recikla\u017enemu toku in jih predelajo v surovine, ve\u010dina pa jih kon\u010da na odlagali\u0161\u010dih, kjer jih izvozijo v dr\u017eave tretjega sveta. Podjetja se nato lahko odlo\u010dijo za nakup nekaterih surovin, predvsem , ,  in zmanj\u0161ajo porabo novih materialov. \nPo drugi strani pa je industrija, ki dejansko popravlja ra\u010dunalnike, bolj usklajena z Zero waste na\u010delom za oblikovanje dolgoro\u010dne ponovne uporabe. To se imenuje  in je \u017ee pred trenutno akcijo zbiranja in razpo\u0161iljanja . Njihova organizacija je v letih delovanja podarila ogromno ra\u010dunalnikov \u0161olam,  in raznim . Na\u010drtovanje Zero waste zahteva, da se komponente preoblikuje za u\u010dinkovito ponovno uporabo ter hkrati zahteva vse ve\u010dje preoblikovanje oziroma popravljanje.\nZero waste management je slabo podprt s strani vladnih zakonov, ki bi uveljavili  \n[hierarhija ravnanja z odpadki | hierarhija zmanj\u0161evanja odpadkov, ponovna uporaba in \nrecikliranje.] V praksi ti zakoni vedno poudarjajo pomen uni\u010denja in recikla\u017ee odpadkov, \nmedtem ko je ponovna uporaba vedno marginalizirana. \nPosebnost Zero waste managementa je na\u010delo, da se lahko uporablja pri kateremkoli proizvodu \nali procesu, v vsaki situaciji in pri vsaki ravni. To velja tudi za strupene kemikalije, kot \ntudi za benigne zadeve. Prav tako to velja tudi za onesna\u017eevanje ozra\u010dja zaradi se\u017eiganja \npremoga ali za odpadke iz radioaktivnih virov s poskusom, da bi iz prese\u017eka jedrskih \nelektrarn ustvarili jedrski odpadek. Vsi postopki so lahko oblikovani tako, da je dele\u017e \nstvari, ki se jih zavr\u017ee, minimaliziran, tako v lastnih postopkih in v uporabi ali potro\u0161nji \nmaterialov, katerih razvoj vodi tja. Recikliranje, na drugi strani, pa se ukvarja le s \npreprostimi materiali.\nZero Waste (ni\u010d odpadkov) se lahko uporablja tudi za odpadke \u010dlove\u0161kega potenciala, nastalih \nzaradi rev\u0161\u010dine in zanikanja izobra\u017eevalnih mo\u017enosti. Vklju\u010duje nov pogled na zmanj\u0161evanje \nzapravljanja energije v industriji in transportu ter zapravljanje svetovnih de\u017eevnih gozdov. \nTo je splo\u0161no na\u010delo oblikovanja za u\u010dinkovito uporabo vseh virov, vendar opredeljeno.\nRecikliranje se po\u010dasi lo\u010duje od svoje trdne podlage v zvezi z ravnanjem z odpadki z \nvklju\u010devanjem vpra\u0161anj, ki so podobna gibanju za trajnostni razvoj. \nZero waste na drugi strani pa ne bazira na omejitvah ravnanja z odpadki, pa\u010d pa poudarja \npove\u010danje ponovne uporabe z uporabo novih metod ki zmanj\u0161ajujejo in odstranjujejo \u0161kodljive metode, kot so se\u017eiganje in recikliranje. Zero waste si \nprizadeva, da so novi izdelki napravljeni za popravilo, prenovitev, obnovitev in na \nsplo\u0161no lahko ponovno uporabljeni.\nVeliko odlagali\u0161\u010d trenutno presega svojo kapaciteto. To se pogosto napa\u010dno uporablja kot opravi\u010dilo za selitev v Zero Waste. Drugi kazalec poudarja, da obstajajo velike povr\u0161ine , ki so na voljo po vsej ZDA in drugih dr\u017eav, ki bi jih lahko uporabljali za . To ni ve\u010d argument proti potrebi po Zero Waste, kot prej\u0161nji argument. Osnovna potreba po premiku na , zasnovano po na\u010delih Zero Waste izhaja iz ogromne izgube sredstev, ki je nelo\u010dljivo povezana s slabo narejenih, kratkotrajnih artiklov in proizvodnih procesov. Dejansko metanje sedaj neuporabnih elementov na smeti\u0161\u010de, je komaj majhen del\u010dek, v zvezi z odpadki, ki jih predstavlja. Slabo zasnovane predloge z uni\u010devanjem smeti, ki se pojavljajo na , da vse veselo uni\u010dujejo, kot na\u010din za re\u0161itev problema smeti, so v zmoti, saj so le te same po sebi problem. Ti predlogi obi\u010dajno trdijo, da se pretvori vse ali velik del obstoje\u010dih smeti v olje in v\u010dasih trdijo, da proizvajajo toliko , da bo svet odslej bogat s teko\u010dimi . En tak na\u010drt, imenovan \"Vse v olje\" je bilo predstavljeno v revijah Discover Magazine in Fortune Magazine leta 2004, \u010deprav so trdili, absurdno, da bi lahko pretvorili hladilnik v \"light Texas crude\" z uporabo visoke pare. Zero Waste analize, ki so dolge na znanstvenih rezultatih in kratke na spektakularnih povzpetkih, ne prejme tak\u0161ne promocije s strani medijev.\nPrimer podjetja, ki je pokazala spremembo politike odlaganja odpadkov, je  (GM). Cilj GM je najti na\u010din za  ali pa ponovno uporabiti 90% vseh materialov s prodajo odpadnih materialov in celo recikliranje uporabljenih delovnih rokavic. Ostanke bi lahko se\u017egali in s tem ustvarili energijo za rastline. Poleg tega, da je  prijazno, lahko prihranijo denar z zmanj\u0161anjem odpadkov in ustvarijo bolj u\u010dinkovito proizvodnjo. Vse te  potiskajo naprej, da bi ustvarile na\u0161  \u010dist in proizvodnjo z ni\u010d odpadkov.\nOdpadki na odlagali\u0161\u010dih, se lahko uporabijo tudi za koristne stvari, kot na primer pri proizvodnji  ali  za polj\u0161\u010dine.\nPrav tako se lahko ponovno uporabi ali reciklira za nekaj, kar lahko je lahko dejansko uporabno. \"Uspeh General Motors pri ustvarjanju na\u010dina brez odpadkov ka\u017eejo, da so ti cilji mo\u010dna spodbuda za proizvajalce, da zmanj\u0161ajo svoje odpadke in pojavljanje ogljika\" pravi Latisha Petteway, predstavnica za EPA. \nBistvenega pomena za poslanstvo Eco-Cycle je pou\u010devanje naslednje generacije o recikliranju in okolju. Od leta 1987, je Eco-Cycle usklajeno Boulder County School Recikliranje in okoljsko izobra\u017eevanje Program s financiranjem iz Boulder County, Boulder Valley School District, Eco-Cycle in razli\u010dnih virov nepovratnih sredstev.\nV tej inovativni nov program se lokalne \u0161oleosredoto\u010dajo na projekte, zmanj\u0161evanje odpadkov in kompostiranje poleg tradicionalnih recikliranje, dajanje \u0161tudentov, u\u010diteljev in zaposlenih na teh \u0161olah na samem vrhu za ohranjanje virov, kot so delo v smeri Zero odpadkov.\nOd leta 1987, je Eco-Cycle usklajeno Boulder recikliranje in okoljsko izobra\u017eevalni program, ki ga trenutno financira Boulder County, Boulder Valley School District, Broomfield County, City of Boulder, mesto Superior, Eco-Cycle in razli\u010dni viri nepovratnih sredstev. Program predvideva zbiranje recikla\u017enih materialov iz vseh 53.800 \u0161tudentov in zaposlenih v 82 Boulder Valley in St Vrain Valley javnih \u0161olah (dve okro\u017eji). Zagotavlja tudi mese\u010dne povratne informacije za posamezne \u0161ole o napredku programa. Ve\u010d kot 1.500 izobra\u017eevalne predstavitve so imeli ve\u010d kot 47.000 vrtec skozi 12. razreda \u0161tudentov v Boulder in Broomfield County \u0161ole vsako leto.\nTo je medsebojno delovanje treh vidikov (zbiranje, izobra\u017eevanje in povratne informacije), ki je ta program, tako edinstven in u\u010dinkovit. Dejansko zbiranje recikla\u017enih materialov omogo\u010da \u0161tudentom, da dajo znanje in skrb, ki so jih pridobili iz izobra\u017eevalnega komponente v pozitivne ukrepe. Izobra\u017eevanje komponenta nudi informacije in motivacije, potrebne za \u0161tudente, da sledite s pomo\u010djo na recikliranje, zmanj\u0161evanje odpadkov in ohranjanje dejavnosti. Redne povratne informacije \u0161olam ohranja recikliranje v ospredju in zaradi \u010desar je sestavni del vsakdanjega \u017eivljenja \u0161ole. Vsi trije vidiki so klju\u010dnega pomena za velika uspeha programa, zaradi \u010desar je dr\u017eavni model za druge, ki \u017eelijo za\u010deti podobne projekte.\nVeliko zasebnih in \u010darterskih \u0161ol je izrazil interes, da bi postali Green Star School. V odgovor je Eco-Cycle za\u010del Green Star \u0160ole-Zero lo\u010devanje odpadkov s certifikatom spomladi leta 2011. Skozi ta program, Eco-Cycle prina\u0161a pomembne pomo\u010d pri vzpostavitvi Zero prakse odpadkov, postopke in izobra\u017eevanje za zasebne / charter \u0161olske skupnosti za za\u010detno pristojbino in ponovne certifikacije letno pristojbino. \nEco-Cycle bo pomagalo zasebnih \u0161ola prilagoditi svoje Zero prizadevanje Odpadkov, ki odra\u017ea kulturo \u0161ole. Ponovne certifikacije vklju\u010duje \u0161olo dokumentacijo Zero odpadkov praks in Eco-Cycle revizijo objekta.\nZero waste je cilj, proces, na\u010din razmi\u0161lajanja, da bi se korenito spremenil na\u0161 pristop do virov in proizvodnje. Zero waste ne govori o recikliranju in preusmeritvah iz odlagali\u0161\u010d, ampak o razgradnji proizvoda in distribucijskih sistemih, ki prepre\u010dujejo nastajanje odpadkov \u017ee pri proizvodnji. Materiali, ki so potrebni v teh preoblikovanih, izvorno ucinkovitih sistemih bodo ponovno uporabljeni velikokrat, ravno tako kot izdelki, ki jih vkljucujejo. Razgradnjo lahko opi\u0161emo kot gradnjo in obratno. Vkljucuje previdnost, da bi se gradnja pove\u010dala iz ponovno uporabljenih materialov, s \u010dimer je manj , vendar ohranjamo vire. Razgradnja lahko zajema meteriale in nekatere komponente od miljonih zgradb, ki obstajajo vendar niso zasnovane za visoko stopnjo ponovne uporabe in imajo omejene mo\u017enosti za pristop k Zero Waste stali\u0161\u010du. Zero Waste daje prednost oblikovanju zgradb iz zdru\u017eenja visoko kakovostnih sestavin, ne pa da so izdelane iz  kot so ,  in . Detajli niso \u0161e dolo\u010deni ampak celotni prostori, vklju\u010dno s ,  in  ali celotni sistemi so lahko vnaprej zgrajeni in name\u0161\u010deni kot celotne sestavine, to bi bil cilj Zero Waste zasnove. Dokler so stavbe zgrajene kot komponente, ki jih lahko potem demontiramo, je razgradnja proces s katerim bomo ustavili vrzel, ki jo  lahko uporabijo za zmanj\u0161anje odpadkov gradbenega materiala. Za zdaj, najve\u010dji del, ki ga lahko shranimo so po navadi  elementi, ,  in . Veliko od teh je bilo sharanjenih in ponovno prodanih s ponovno uporabo  kot je  v , . Glavni deli, ki jih morajo \u0161e vedno drobiti so lesena tla,  in strukturne .  tradicionalnih stavb se dolgo dela z  ali z . Socialni in politi\u010dni predpisi, kot je kontrolna licenca za ru\u0161enje in potrebna dovoljenja, dovoljujejo, da se samo uni\u010di in zavr\u017ee (z delom recikliranja ru\u0161evin in ), kajti uni\u010devanje in stro\u0161ki odstranjevanja so cenej\u0161i kot razgradnja. Pribli\u017eno sedemdeset  odpadkov je narejnih na pribli\u017eno vsak kvadratni meter ru\u0161enja stanovanjske stavbe. Obstaja mo\u017enost, da je to siva ekonomija, ki temelji na kulturni prednosti potratnosti in Zero waste na\u010drtuje, da bo razgradnja komponent, na koncu vendarle najcenej\u0161i in najbolj konzervativen na\u010din za ponovno gradnjo stavb. Nadaljnji pogovori o tej temi lahko najdete na ZWI spletni strani.\nTr\u017ene, posredovalnozakonodajne akcije kot sta raz\u0161irjena odgovornost proizvajalca (EPR) in previdnostno na\u010delo, sta med \u0161tevilnimi akcijami, ki imajo slogan  in visijo na njih z zahtevki, da bodo nelo\u010dljivo vodili k politiki Zero waste. Trnutno ni dokazov, da bo EPR pove\u010dal ponovno uporabo, namesto zgolj gibanja zavr\u017eeno in odlo\u017eeno s pogodbami o odlaganju v . Previdnostno na\u010delo je dano naprej, da premakne odgovornost za dokazovanje, da so nove kemikalije varne pred dru\u017ebo (deluje kot morski pra\u0161i\u010dek), katere jim ponujajo podjetja. Kot taka je njegova povezava z Zero waste dvomljiva. Prav tako je veliko organizacij, mest in ob\u010din sprejelo slogan Zero waste med tem, ko ni bilo pritiska na spremembe na nobenega od klju\u010dev Zero waste. V bistvu je skupno za ve\u010dino, da poenostavljeno navaja, da je  njihov celoten cilj. Veliko poslovnih ali industrijskih podjetij se nagiba k zavzetju Zero waste, vendar to obi\u010dajno ne pomeni ve\u010djega napora kot recikliranje glavnih materialov, ki ne vpljivajo na ponovno proizvodnjo. Primeri vklu\u010dujejo , , ,  in kampanje za vrnitev ra\u010dunalnikov. Zgodej\u0161e kampanje za socialno pravi\u010dnost so uspe\u0161no pritisnile na , da spremeni njihovo prakso nakupovanja mesa ter na , da spremeni svojo delavno prakso v . Oba sta namre\u010d temeljila na ideji, da so lahko organizirani potro\u0161niki aktivni udele\u017eenci v gospodarstvu in ne samo pasivni predmeti. Kakorkoli \u017ee, napovedan in prisiljen cilj javne kampanje je kriti\u010den. Cilj zmanj\u0161anja nastajanja odpadkov ali odmetavanja s pove\u010danjem recikliranja ne bo dosegel cilja preoblikovanja proizvoda in tako razumno ne more biti oklican kot kampanja Zero waste.\nPreoblikovanja vzorcev uporabe \u010dlove\u0161kih virov je izziv, ki presega obseg razdrobljenih in \npovezanih zakonov.   Doprinos politike odra\u017ea te\u017enjo po gradnji na obstoje\u010dih temeljih z minimalnimi motnjami trenutnega stanja.  Na nacionalni ravni to ne more dose\u010di ciljev Zero Waste (ni\u010d odpadkov). Potreben je premik s strani dr\u017eave (formalne organizacije in postopki javnega sektorja) za upravljanje (palete vladnih in nevladnih organizacij)  Sama vlada nima zmo\u017enosti za dosego cilja Zero waste (ni\u010d odpadkov), to zahteva sodelovanje podjetij, nevladnih organizacij, javnosti in upravljanje s strani dr\u017eave. Upravljanje se na koncu ukvarja z \"ustvarjanjem pogojev za odrejanje pravil in kolektivnih ukrepov\"  in za dosego Zero Waste je potreben odmik od ideologije preprostega odlaganja odpadkov.  Vloga dr\u017eave je v tem, da deluje kot osrednji mehanizem za usmerjanje in upravljanje mre\u017ee, ki zdru\u017euje upravljanje; javnost in udele\u017eenci na trgu so zelo pomembni za dosego Zero waste, kot tudi za dosego ostalih okoljevarstvenih ciljev. Na svetovnem vrhu o trajnostnem razvoju v Johannesburgu je bilo poudarjeno partnerstvo med razli\u010dnimi zainteresiranimi stranmi v okolju in vzpostavitev javno-zasebnega partnerstva, kar je najbolj\u0161i na\u010din za dosego trajnostnega razvoja. \nLep primer pristopa k upravljanju omre\u017eja je mogo\u010de videti v Veliki Britaniji, kjer so s pomo\u010djo projekta New Labour, ki je predlagal ustanovitev regionalnih skupin in s tem zdru\u017eil klju\u010dne interesne skupine v ravnanju z odpadki (predstavnike lokalnih oblasti, industrije, vladnih slu\u017eb itd), na prostovoljni bazi. Obstaja pa pomanjkanje jasne vizije vladne politike o tem, kako izpolniti cilje za preusmeritev odpadkov z odlagali\u0161\u010d, katerim se pove\u010duje obseg tako na regionalni kot lokalni ravni. Skupni cilj je cilj, ki ga dolo\u010di vlada, toda poti za dosego tega cilja ostajajo odprte.  Upravljanje pri ravnanju z odpadki si prizadeva raz\u0161iriti spekter vklju\u010denih zainteresirasnih strani in izbolj\u0161ati koordinacijo med njimi. To aktivira kolektivno delovanja, ki je bistvenega pomena za premagovanje morebitnih konfliktov pri re\u0161evanju ciljev za dosego vizije Zero Waste.\nIzziv pri upravljanju z odpadki je, kako zagotoviti, da bomo dosegli skupno delovanje in sodelovanje vseh vpletenih. Zero Waste je strategija, ki jo spodbujajo okoljske nevladne organizacije, toda industrija odpadkov je bolj nagnjena v korist kapitalsko usmerjene opcije s pridobivanjem energije s pomo\u010djo se\u017eiganja odpadkov. Raziskave pogosto izpostavljajo javno podporo kot prvo zahtevo za uspeh  Na Tajvanu je bilo javno mnenje klju\u010dnega pomena pri spreminjanju odnosa podjetij, ki morajo sedaj pri svojem delovanju in proizvodnji v \u010dimve\u010dji meri upo\u0161tevati na\u010delo Zero Waste.  Javnost se je s pomo\u010djo komunikacije in poudarjanja povezovanja pri projetu Zero Waste preko vladnih in nevladnih organizacij pri\u010dela zavedati pomena trajnostnega razvoja. Zadnji dose\u017eek pri na\u010delu Zero Waste je bil dose\u017een v mestu Masdar v Abu Dhabiju, ki se je zavezalo, da bo to mesto brez odpadkov. Inovacije in tehnologije so spodbujane s strani vlade z oblikovanjem prijaznega okolja, toda za podjetja niso zavezujo\u010da.  Za uspe\u0161en model trajnostnega razvoja mesta pa bo prav tako potrebna vklju\u010ditev vseh \u010dlanov dru\u017ebe s poudarjanjem na skupnem sodelovanju.\n"},

In areas with low  waste generation may have been negligible. In higher population areas even largely  had to be dealt with. Sometimes this was released back into the ground water with  like . The  of  had a fixed monthly ritual, in which the people of the village would gather together and burn their garbage in large dumps.\nFollowing the onset of  and the sustained urban growth of large population centres in , the buildup of waste in the cities caused a rapid deterioration in levels of sanitation and the general quality of urban life. The streets became choked with filth due to the lack of waste clearance regulations. Calls for the establishment of a municipal authority with waste removal powers were mooted as early as 1751 by  in London, who proposed that \"...as the preservation of the health of the people is of great importance, it is proposed that the cleaning of this city, should be put under one uniform public management, and all the filth be...conveyed by the  to proper distance in the country\".\nThe first occurrence of organised solid waste management system appeared in London in the late 18th century. A waste collection and resource recovery system was established around the 'dust-yards'. Main constituent of municipal waste was the coal ash (\u2018dust\u2019) which had a market value for brick-making and as a soil improver. Such profitability encouraged dust-contractors to recover effectively 100% of the residual wastes remaining after readily saleable items and materials had been removed by the informal sector in the streets ('rag-and-bone men'). Therefore, this was an early example of organised, municipal-wide solid waste management. The dust-yard system had been working successfully up to middle 1850s, when the market value of \u2018dust\u2019 collapsed. It was important in facilitating a relatively smooth transition to an institutionalised, municipally-run solid waste management system in England.\nIn the mid-19th century, spurred by increasingly devastating  outbreaks and the emergence of a public health debate that the first consolidated legislation on the issue emerged. Highly influential in this new focus was the report  in 1842 of the , , in which he argued for the importance of adequate waste removal and management facilities to improve the health and wellbeing of the city's population. Chadwick's proposals were based on the  theory of disease transmission, which was proven to be false following the turn of the 1900s.\nThe  of 1846 began what was to be a steadily evolving process of the provision of regulated waste management in London. The  was the first citywide authority that centralized sanitation regulation for the rapidly expanding city and the  made it compulsory for every household to deposit their weekly waste in 'moveable receptacles' for disposal - the first concept for a dust-bin.\nThe dramatic increase in waste for disposal led to the creation of the first  plants, or, as they were then called, 'destructors'. In 1874, the first incinerator was built in  by  to the design of Alfred Fryer. However, these were met with opposition on account of the large amounts of ash they produced and which wafted over the neighbouring areas.\nSimilar municipal systems of waste disposal sprung up at the turn of the 20th century in other large cities of  and . In 1895,  became the first U.S. city with public-sector garbage management.\nEarly  were simply open bodied  pulled by a team of horses. They became motorized in the early part of the 20th century and the first close body trucks to eliminate odours with a dumping lever mechanism were introduced in the 1920s in Britain. These were soon equipped with 'hopper mechanisms' where the scooper was loaded at floor level and then hoisted mechanically to deposit the waste in the truck. The  was the first truck in 1938, to incorporate a hydraulic compactor.\nIn the 19th century, in the United States, cities often became choked with horse manure. While the odor was tolerable to 19th century sensitivities, walking through the streets without boots, resulted in deplorable appearing footwear. In many cities, lacking trash collection, pigs and dogs ran loose, consuming the trash, but excreting dung, which smelled offensively. Dead animals, particularly horses, were left lying in the streets, facilitating disease.\n"},

The WEEE Directive set ,  and  targets for all types of , with a minimum rate of 4  per head of population  recovered for recycling by 2009. The RoHS Directive set restrictions upon European  as to the  content of new electronic equipment placed on the .\nThe symbol adopted by the  to represent waste electrical and electronic equipment comprises a crossed-out  with or without a single black line underneath the symbol. The black line indicates that goods have been placed on the market after 2005, when the Directive came into force. Goods without the black line were manufactured between 2002 and 2005. In such instances, these are treated as \"historic WEEE\" and fall outside reimbursement via producer compliance schemes.\nThe directive has undergone a number of minor revisions since its inception in 2002 (Directive 2002/96/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 2003). These include updates in 2006 and 2009.\nAfter nine years the Directive was seen as failing to achieve some of its goals, hence the legislation had been amended again. On 20 December 2011 the  and the  agreed on amendments to the Directive, subject to a second-reading vote, which was taken on 19 January 2012.\nThe changes affect the method for calculating collection rates, which were previously 4 kg per inhabitant per year. To provide a transitional period of seven years to introduce the revised method of calculation, the present method is retained for the first four years from the time the amended Directive comes into force. For the next three years, commencing with the fifth year after the amendment, the calculation of collection rates will be revised to 45% of the weight of E&E products entering the market. Once this seven years transitional period is over,  will individually select the actual collection options they wish to use.\nThe overall aim was for the EU to recycle at least 85% of electrical and electronics waste equipment by 2016.\nThe directive imposes the responsibility for the disposal of waste electrical and electronic equipment on the manufacturers or distributors of such equipment. It requires that those companies establish an infrastructure for collecting WEEE, in such a way that \"Users of electrical and electronic equipment from private households should have the possibility of returning WEEE at least free of charge\". The directive saw the formation of national \"producer compliance schemes\", into which manufacturers and distributors paid an annual  for the collection and recycling of associated waste electronics from household waste recycling centres.\nThe WEEE Directive obliged the then twenty-five EU member states to transpose its provisions into national law by 13 August 2004. Only  met this deadline. On 13 August 2005, one year after the deadline, all member states except for the  had transposed at least framework regulations. The WEEE Directive was transposed into UK law in 2006, and was active the following year.\nThe directive places WEEE into numerous categories, the first tier being historic and non-historic. Historic WEEE implies equipment placed on the market prior to 2005 and the WEEE directive places the onus upon the owner of the equipment to make provisions for its recycling.  Where equipment was placed on the market after 2005, it is known as non-historic WEEE (denoted by a bar underneath the crossed-out wheeled bin symbol), and it is the responsibility of the producer/distributor to make provisions for its collection and recycling.\nThe WEEE directive sets a total of 10 categories of WEEE for reporting purposes.\nPrior to the implementation of the WEEE directive in the UK, waste electronic and electrical equipment was disposed of in the household (municipal) waste stream. Post the introduction of the Hazardous Waste Regulations, exclusions apply to electrical and electronic equipment that are deemed hazardous. Hazardous wastes are derived (issued with a universal EU descriptor) from the European Waste Catalogue (known in the UK as the List of Wastes), which denotes wastes with a six digit number in three sets of two.  Hazardous wastes are denoted with an asterisk at the end of the number. Hazardous electronic wastes comprise:\nWEEE that is delivered to household waste recycling centres (HWRC), also known as designated collection facilities (DCFs), is collected by or delivered to approved authorised treatment facilities (AATFs).  The waste electrical and electronic equipment is then weighed and categorised in accordance with the directive.\nPost re-processing (recycling), total volumes of each category are reported to the producer compliance scheme and the reprocessor is reimbursed accordingly.  Totals of obligated WEEE for all AATFs are collated by the environment agency on a quarterly basis and reported to the EU.\nHistorically, there were problems with the implementation of the producer compliance schemes due to a \"double counting\" and reporting of reprocessed WEEE to producer compliance schemes.  This arose where obligated WEEE was partially treated by the first AATF to receive the waste, prior to it being passed onto a second AATF for further treatment.  Both the first and second AATF would then claim against the same waste electronics, resulting in a \"net debt\" against the wastes being treated.\nAdditional legislation that applies is:\nThe management of WEEE is applied via the , with particular emphasis upon reduction of waste arising,  of equipment and  (recovery) of materials: . In January 2012, proposals were debated by the European Parliament to recast the WEEE Directive. The proposals included increasing recycling rates.

It aims \"to protect the environment from adverse effects of waste water discharges from cities and \"certain industrial sectors\".\nIt prescribes the waste water collection and treatment in  with a  of over 2000, and more advanced treatment in places with a population equivalent greater than 10,000 in \"sensitive areas\".\nThe Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive (full title ) is a  regarding urban waste water collection,  and its discharge, as well as the treatment and discharge of \"waste water from certain industrial sectors\". It was adopted on 21 May 1991. It aims \"to protect the environment from the adverse effects of urban waste water discharges and discharges from certain industrial sectors\" by mandating waste water collection and treatment in  with a  of over 2000, and more advanced treatment in places with a population equivalent above 10,000 in sensitive areas.\nThe directive defines sensitive areas, as \" bodies,  and coastal waters which are  or which may become eutrophic if protective action is not taken\", \"surface freshwaters intended for the abstraction of  which contain or are likely to contain more than 50 mg/l of nitrates\", areas where further treatment is necessary to comply with other directives, such as the directives on fish waters, on bathing waters, on shellfish waters, on the conservation of wild birds and natural habitats, etc.\nThe directive contains a  for areas designated as \"less sensitive\"; such derogations were approved for areas in Portugal.\n were required to make waste water treatment facilities available \nIn a 2004 Commission report on implementation by the member states, the Commission noted that some member states, in particular France and Spain, had been tardy in providing the required information, and infringement procedures had been initiated. The report mentioned Spain's non-provision of any advanced treatment in the  of rivers identified as sensitive in their downstream section, such as the  and the ; Italy's implementation in the catchment area of the , the delta and adjacent coastal waters; and the United Kingdom's interpretation and implementation of the directive in regard to the catchment areas of sensitive areas. Most member states planned to achieve conformity with the Directive by 2005 or 2008 at the latest.\nThe Urban Waste Water Directive marked a shift from legislation aimed at end-use standards to stricter legislation aimed at regulating water quality at the source. The directive applied both to domestic waste water and to waste water from industrial sectors, both of which account for much of the pollution. The Directive is an example of the detailed nature of European Union legislation and resulted in \"significant costs in many member states\".\nNine years after the directive was adopted, considerable variations remained in the provision of sewage treatment in the different member states.\nOn 13 July 2018, the European Commission published a Consultation on the Evaluation of the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive ahead of a potential revision. Since its adoption in 1991, new technical advances on treatment techniques for waste and emerging pollutants have been identified that might require removal. In addition, the EU has since enlarged from 12 to 28 countries and new different experiences and challenges need to be taken into account.\nHowever, the biggest challenge of the revision will be to exploit the potential the  sector can contribute to the  agenda and the fight against . Globally, the wastewater treatment sector consumes 1% of the global total energy consumption. Under a business as usual scenario, this figure is expected to increase by 60% by 2040 compared to 2014. With the introduction of energy efficiency requirements, the energy consumption of the wastewater treatment sector can be reduced by 50% only by using current technologies. On top of that, there are also opportunities to produce enough energy from wastewater to turn the whole water sector energy neutral. It uses the energy embedded in the  by producing biogas through . These features have been mainly overlooked due to the over-riding objective for utilities to meet existing and future needs for wastewater treatment.\n"},

It covers the deliberate  at sea of  or other matter from vessels, aircraft, and platforms. It does not cover discharges from land-based sources such as pipes and outfalls, wastes generated incidental to normal operation of vessels, or placement of materials for purposes other than mere disposal, providing such disposal is not contrary to aims of the Convention. It entered into force in 1975. As of September 2016, there were 89 Parties to the Convention.\nThe Convention was called for by the  (June 1972, Stockholm), the treaty was drafted at the  (13 November 1972, London) and it was opened for signature on 29 December 1972. It entered into force on 30 August 1975 when 15 nations ratified. As of 1 October 2001, there were 78 Contracting Parties to the Convention. International Administration of the Convention functions through Consultative Meetings held at International Maritime Organization (IMO) headquarters in London.\nThe London Convention consists of 22 Articles and three Annexes. It follows a \"black list/grey list\" approach to regulating ocean dumping; Annex I materials (black list) generally may not be ocean dumped (though for certain Annex I materials dumping may be permissible if present only as \"trace contaminants\" or \"rapidly rendered harmless\" and Annex II materials (grey list) require \"special care\". Annex III lays out general technical factors to be considered in establishing criteria for issuance of ocean dumping permits.\nThe main objective of the London Convention is to prevent indiscriminate disposal at sea of wastes that could be liable for creating hazards to human health; harming living resources and marine life; damaging amenities; or interfering with other legitimate uses of the sea. The 1972 Convention extends its scope over \"all marine waters other than the internal waters\" of the States and prohibits the dumping of certain hazardous materials. It further requires a prior special permit for the dumping of a number of other identified materials and a prior general permit for other wastes or matter.\nSince its entering into force in 1975, the convention has provided a framework for international control and prevention of marine pollution within which the contracting parties have achieved continuous progress in keeping the oceans clean. Among its milestones are the 1993 ban on ocean disposal of low-level radioactive wastes and the resolutions to end the dumping and incineration of industrial wastes. The efforts of the Parties are supported by a permanent secretariat hosted by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). The consultative meeting of the contracting parties to the London convention is the governing and political decision-making body of the convention. It takes advice on issues needing multidisciplinary expertise from the  which is composed of specialised experts nominated by the , , , , , , , , and . A scientific group on dumping, composed of government experts from the parties to the convention a responsible to address any scientific requests from the consultative meeting, including the preparation of lists of hazardous substances, developing guide-lines on the implementation of the convention, and maintaining awareness of the impacts on the marine environments of inputs from all waste sources.\nThe convention is implemented in the United States through Title I of the  (MPRSA) which directs that implementing regulations are to apply binding requirements of LC to the extent that this would not relax the MPRSA.\nOn 17 November 1996, a special meeting of the Contracting Parties adopted the \"1996 Protocol to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, 1972\" which is to replace the 1972 Convention, subject to ratification. In line with UNCED's Agenda 21, the 1996 Protocol reflects the global trend towards precaution and prevention with the parties agreeing to move from controlled dispersal at sea of a variety of land-generated wastes towards integrated land-based solutions for most, and controlled sea disposal of few, remaining categories of wastes or other matter.\nAmong the most important innovations brought by the 1996 protocol is the codification of the \"\" and the \"polluter pays principle.\" Reflecting these principles, the protocol embodies a major structural revision of the convention the so-called \"reverse list\" approach. Now, instead of prohibiting the dumping of certain (listed) hazardous materials, the parties are obligated to prohibit the dumping of any waste or other matter that is not listed in Annex 1 (\"the reverse list\") of the 1996 protocol. Dumping of wastes or other matter on this reverse list requires a permit. Parties to the protocol are further obligated to adopt measures to ensure that the issuance of permits and permit conditions for the dumping of reverse list substances comply with Annex 2 (the Waste Assessment Annex) of the protocol. The substances on the reverse list include dredged material;  ; industrial  waste; vessels and offshore platforms or other man-made structures at sea; inert, inorganic geological material; organic material of natural origin; and bulky items including iron, steel, concrete and similar materials for which the concern is physical impact, and limited to those circumstances where such wastes are generated at locations with no land-disposal alternatives. In addition, the 1996 protocol prohibits altogether the practice of incineration at sea, except for emergencies, and prohibits the exports of wastes or other matter to non-Parties for the purpose of dumping or incineration at sea.\nThe 1996 protocol has effectively moved the scope of the original London convention landwards, relating it to the policy and management issues of land as well as sea wastes disposal. Indicative for this shift are such elements as the codification of the precautionary approach and the establishment of requirements such as the \"waste prevention audit,\" the identification and control of the sources of contamination for certain materials, and the collaboration with relevant local and national agencies that are involved in point and non-point source pollution control. In this context, Integrated Coastal Management (ICM) comes as a natural framework for effective implementation of the objectives of the protocol. Relaying on its vast ICM technical expertise, the National Ocean Service (NOS) is to contribute to the creation of the necessary foundation for the US accession to the 1996 Protocol and, further on, to the protocol's implementation. Through its International Program Office, NOS would also contribute to the international co-operation efforts towards meeting the objectives of the 1996 Protocol.\n (87 as of 2013) Afghanistan, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Australia, Azerbaijan, Barbados, Belarus (ratified as ), Belgium, Benin, Bolivia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Cape Verde, Chile, People's Republic of China, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Costa Rica, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Croatia, Cuba, Cyprus, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Finland, France, Gabon, Germany, Greece, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Hungary, Iceland, Iran, Ireland, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Jordan, Kenya, Kiribati, South Korea, Libya, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Monaco, Montenegro, Morocco, Nauru, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Russia (ratified as the ), Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Serbia (ratified as ), Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Slovenia, Solomon Islands, South Africa, Spain, Suriname, Sweden, Switzerland, Syria, Tanzania, Tonga, Tunisia, Ukraine (ratified as ), United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, and Vanuatu.\n"},

Food waste has been discussed in newspaper articles, news reports and television programmes, which have increased awareness of it as a public issue. To tackle waste issues, encompassing food waste, the government-funded \"\" (WRAP) was created in 2000.\nThe main and most common method of disposal in the United Kingdom is . Other methods are also used such as  and . Out of all of the waste that was from household, commercial and industrial waste, approximately 57% of the waste was disposed in landfill sites. In addition some waste from , mining waste, and quarrying waste are moved to landfill sites. Landfill has been the most efficient way of disposal in the UK, as of in 1994 there were approximately 4000 landfill sites.\nThroughout the country, the average person generates a little over one thousand pounds of waste per year. \u00a0This average varies city to city-ranging from seven hundred to slightly over thirteen hundred pounds per person a year.\nThis is the illegal dumping of waste, most commonly found among roadways or abandon areas, \u00a0which has been increasing and becoming a problem within parts of the UK.  Household items are the most commonly found items among incidents. \u00a0In 2018 there was over 1 million (1,072,000) fly tipping incidents which was more than a 5% increase from the previous year.  Majority of the culprits are individuals who are unwilling to pay or allocate the time to properly dispose of their waste. \u00a0The most common size load was equivalent to the size of a small work van.  These incidents threaten human health as it pollutes the air and harms the environment significantly.  It was estimated that the cost of clearance of this waste by officials was over sixty million dollars. \u00a0Penalties and regulations have become significantly more harsh in order to deal with this issue.\nThis waste is produced mainly from mining and minerals as well as any other unaffiliated oil or oily water. \u00a0This includes substances such as asbestos, solvents, pesticides, oils etc.  They account for the lowest percentage of waste accumulated in the UK, however can be the most harmful if not properly treated and managed.\nLandfills in the United Kingdom are historically very important resources for waste disposal.

This is because before the  previously used the \u201cdilute and disperse\u201d method of waste. The UK is now looking for options to reduce the levels of their landfill sites through legislation. \u00a0 This is a United Kingdom national strategy of which member states set up methods to target  in landfills. These methods include and are mainly composed of , , and .\nThere are a number of  power plants in the UK especially in .

Each year, over 3.2 million tons of electronic waste is put in US landfills. A large portion of this electronic waste is computers, monitors, and televisions. Over 100 million computers, monitors, and televisions are disposed of yearly in the U.S. Although there is an enormous amount of electronic waste in the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency found that in 2009 approximately only about 25% of all electronic waste is recycled in the United States. About 70% of metals that are found in the United States landfills come from electronic devices. The disposure of all this electronic waste has a detrimental effect on the environment, as well as the global economy.\nElectronic waste has become serious issue for the environmental stability in the United States. Over the years, the government has become increasingly more involved in this issue. As described in the U.S.  Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery report of 2009, after the electronic products are purchased and used, they are separated into two groups. One group of electronics is collected for , while the other is disposal. After this, the products that are disposal mainly are put into , and the rest of electronics that were collected for recycling are either refurbished, reused, or used for material. Hans Tammemagi, the author of , talks about the detrimental effect the waste has on the environment. Nearly 20% of all waste in the United States is being incinerated, while the rest of it is being put into landfills. That leaves almost 80% of the waste consumed in the United States being placed into landfills. Out of this 80% of the waste, the majority of this waste is primarily electronic.\nFrom fluorescent light bulbs to common household batteries, every piece of electronic waste that is found in landfills contains some kind of metal. One of the most commonly used metals in electronic waste is lead. Lead is found in most batteries, in the form of lead-acid, and it is also found in CRTs (cathode ray tube). These tubes are primarily used in television screens, as well as computer monitors. Since so many televisions, computer monitors, and batteries are place into landfills that means that most landfills have a large amount of lead in them, which is dangerous to the local environment. This is because the lead, like most hazardous materials that are in landfills, can be absorbed into the soil and ground water. Being exposed to a high level of lead can cause various health issues such as blood and brain disorders, comas, and in serious cases even death. Lead is not the only hazardous metal in U.S. landfills. For example, mercury, beryllium, and chromium are just some of the other metals that are in our landfills that are extremely hazardous to the environment, as well as to human health.\nRecycling is not the only issue surrounding electronic waste\u2019s effects. The economy and trade of raw materials also plays a significant role in the economic issue of electronic waste. In the online journal , Jeffrey D. Weidenhamer and Michael L. Clement claim in their article, \u201cLeaded Electronic Waste is a Possible Source Material for Lead-contaminated Jewelry\u201d that  the majority of electronic waste, which is produced in the United States, is  to numerous Asian countries, primarily , for . This is because the Chinese economy is increasing rapidly, and they have created a need for raw materials, which come from the electronic waste that the United States produces.\nAfter being shipped overseas to China, the electronic waste is then stripped of parts in small Chinese workshops. Because so much of electronic waste has very hazardous material, especially dangerous metals, this creates a hazardous work environment for the people who work on stripping the electronics for spare parts. China does not have strict , so the electronic waste imported from America, which is not stripped for spare parts, ends up in large dumps in communal areas. This creates a very hazardous living environment for people who live near these dumps. There have been several different cases were people, primarily children, become very sick, or even die because of the exposure to all the hazardous material found in the waste dumps in China.\nA major reason that the United States trades the majority of their electronic waste to other countries to harvest raw materials is due to environmental issues. The book, , by John B. Stephenson, discusses the environmental and economic aspects of electronic waste in the United States. Throughout the last few years, the U. S. Government has recognized the environmental issue that landfills create, and has been creating bans on U.S. landfill. Although this may create more environmental stability in the United States, it has become a major environmental and health issue in the countries to which the electronic waste is being shipped.\n"},

Of this, 4.2 million tonnes was generated in Bangkok. The yearly figure in 2009 was 15.1 million tonnes. About twenty percent of total is generated in the  (BMA) Of the waste generated in 2015, only about five million tonnes were recycled. Only about eight million tonnes were handled in accordance with global best practices. Of Thailand's 2,500 dump sites, only about 20 percent are managed properly. According to the Pollution Control Department (PCD), Thailand's primary waste watchdog, the nation faces serious solid waste management issues. Those issues are increasing. Wichan Simachaya, director-general of the PCD, said the volume of waste could continue to grow by 600,000 tonnes a year, due to increasing population and tourism.\nThailand's waste management plan calls for 75 percent of Thailand's total solid waste to be properly disposed of or recycled in some way by 2021, up from the current 49 percent. By 2021, the government and private sector plan to spend a total of 177 billion  (US$5.1 billion) on waste management technology and public awareness campaigns. \"We have fines for littering but no one seems to care,\" Wijarn said. \"We need to step up law enforcement as well as teach people to recycle, reuse and reduce waste.\"\nIn  the roles in  management (MSW) and industrial waste management are organized by the Royal Thai Government, which is then divided among the central government, regional governments, and local governments. Each government is responsible for different tasks. The central government is responsible to stimulate regulation, policies, and standards. The regional governments are responsible for coordinating central and local governments. Local governments are responsible for waste management in their governed area. Local governments themselves do not dispose of waste, but instead hire private companies that have been granted that right by the PCD. A major problem is lack of funding for waste management\u2014the average Thai household pays less than one dollar a month to dispose of its solid waste. The main companies are Bangpoo Industrial Waste Management Center; General Environmental Conservation Public Company Limited (GENCO); SGS Thailand; Waste Management Siam Ltd (WMS); Better World Green Public Company Limited (BWG). and Professional Waste Technology (1999) Public Company Ltd A leading resource recovery company is Wongpanit, who purchase mixed recyclables (paper, plastics, glass, aluminum, steel) at about 11,300  per tonne. These companies are responsible for the waste they have picked up from their customers before disposal.\nThe PCD estimates that in 2017 organic waste collected by municipalities across Thailand accounted for nearly two-thirds of the country's total waste output: a reported 7.6 million \u2014  64%\u2014of the refuse collected was organic waste. It is thought that a significant portion of this waste is not merely fruit and vegetable peelings, but edible surplus food. This in a nation where 400,000 to 600,000 children may be undernourished due to poverty, yet ten percent of all children are obese. Prevailing attitudes do not encompass  or : 64 percent of the Thai population do not sort their rubbish according to one study.\nThailand is a profligate user of one-time use plastics. Thais use 70 billion plastic bags a year. The country is a major contributor, along with  China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Sri Lanka, of up to 60% of  in oceans. Thailand's 23 coastal provinces dump an estimated one million tonnes of garbage into the sea each year. Plastic bags make up 15%, plastic straws account for seven percent, and cigarette butts five percent. According to the , 150 sea turtles, 100 whales and dolphins, and 12  die each year from discarded trash, half of which die from eating plastic bags.\nIn June 2017, Thailand pledged at an international forum to reduce plastic use. Thailand admitted waste mismanagement was the major cause of Thailand's poor record. Delegates representing Thailand's military government at the conference committed to put an end to the problem. Accordingly, it has included waste management in its 20-year national strategy.\nIn an easy step forward, Thailand's Pollution Control Department (PCD) got agreements from five major water bottlers to cease using plastic cap seals on drinking water bottles by 1 April 2018. A cap seal is the small plastic wrap molded over the bottle cap that must be peeled off before the bottle can be opened. Studies have found that bottles without them pose no hygienic health risk. The PCD aims to have them removed from all bottled water containers by the end of 2018. According to the PCD, Thailand produces 4.4 billion plastic drinking water bottles per year. Sixty percent, or 2.6 billion, of these bottles have cap seals. The weight of the plastic cap seals alone is around 520 tonnes per year.\nOn 21 July 2018 the Thai government kicked off a campaign to reduce the use of foam containers and  plastic bags at fresh markets countrywide. Early indications are that those efforts have not been embraced by the Thai public.\nFinally, a ban on single-use plastic bags with a thickness of less than 36  at major retailers was enacted to take effect on 1 January 2020. The ban exempts, until 2021, the 40% of total volume of single-use bags used at wet markets and restaurants. Bag manufacturers have cried foul, arguing that the solution to plastic pollution is proper disposal of bags and recycling. To make matters worse for the manufacturers, eight TV channels signed an agreement with the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment on 2 January 2020 to blur images and footage of single-use plastic bags on-screen, as is done in Thailand for firearms, cigarettes, and alcohol. Thailand imported 480,000 tonnes of plastic garbage from abroad in 2018, and is set to import an additional 220,000 tonnes before existing contracts expire in September 2020. Between 2014 and 2018 Thailand imported 906,521 tonnes of plastic from 81 countries, according to the . Plastic imports nearly doubled between 2018 and 2019 due to increased Chinese imports.\nAs of 2016 Thailand collected and processed the industrial waste of 68,261 companies. Its capacity to process industrial and toxic waste is 37.6 million tonnes annually, an estimated 2.8 million tonnes of which is toxic waste. Total capacity in 2015 was 25.8 million tonnes. The 's Department of Industrial Works (DIW) plans to establish 15 regional waste management facilities throughout the country as detailed in its five-year waste management plan for 2015-2019.\nThe 's 500-bed General Hospital produces about 196,000 pieces of \"medical waste\" per month. About half of this waste consists of \"clean products\": packaging, PVC bags for dialysis solution, and other non-infectious items that could potentially be  or . Thailand has thirty-three 500-or more-bed hospitals, as well as 321 other hospitals and health centres with between 11 and 250 bed nationwide, meaning the quantity of medical waste is significant.\nThailand banned the import of foreign  (e-waste) in June 2019, the same year as China. In spite of the ban, new recycling factories have opened across Thailand, particularly in the eastern provinces, and  of potentially hazardous e-waste are being processed. Since the e-waste ban, 28 new recycling factories, most processing e-waste, started up in   alone. In 2019, 14 businesses in that province were granted licenses to process e-waste. In October 2019, the Thai legislature relaxed labour and environmental regulations for all factories, a boon to the e-waste industry. One provision of the legislation even exempts small companies from pollution monitoring. Concomitantly, a bill to strengthen e-waste restrictions has gone nowhere in parliament. An official of the , which campaigns against dumping waste in poor countries, said, \"E-waste has to go somewhere, and the Chinese are simply moving their entire operations to . The only way to make money is to get huge volume with cheap, illegal labour and pollute the hell out of the environment,\" he added.\nIn a 2004 study commissioned by the  to examine the state of Thailand's infrastructure, the authors concluded that, \"The worst infrastructure provision performance in Thailand is in waste water treatment....Virtually none of the...[waste water treatment] systems are operating....only 3 waste water plants operate sporadically. The problem is that no user fees are assessed or collected and that households and firm [sic] are not required to connect to the systems. Water supply authorities,...have consistently refused to add waste water charges to their water supply bills, despite clear evidence from international experience that this is best practice.\"\nAt the end of 2016, the  (BMA) is considering the imposition of a waste water fee, pending endorsement by the BMA council. If approved, the move will impose fees on waste water release:\nThe fees collected will be used to improve waste water facilities operated by the BMA.\nIn 2015 Thailand produced 9.5 million m of waste water. This was the equivalent of 150 litres per day per person. Only 34 percent of the waste water was treated at one of Thailand's 93 treatment facilities before being returned to the environment. One direct result was a corresponding deterioration of the quality of Thai coastal waters.\nAccording to the  Thailand produces about 50.000 tonnes of solid waste that finds its way into the sea each year. Large quantities of coastal rubbish, especially in the upper reaches of the  impact sea life and coastal mangroves. Mangrove swamps are cluttered with garbage. At one site, the  reported that, \"Plastic bags, bottles, ropes, discarded noodle containers and even a rusty cooking appliance float in the water or are stuck in the mud under the green canopy.\"\nThe Thai Pollution Control Department (PCD) reports that the water quality of major rivers flowing into the upper Gulf of Thailand has seriously deteriorated in the past decade. The department found the lower , which flows through Bangkok, contains bacteria and nutrient pollution from , , and . Nutrient pollution causes algae to grow faster than ecosystems can handle, harming water quality, food resources for aquatic animals, and marine habitats. It also decreases the oxygen that fish need to survive. PCD categorised water quality at the mouth of Chao Phraya at Bangkok's  as \"very poor\" and worse than in 2014. Nearby rivers, such as the  in , were rated \"poor\". PCD findings indicated large amounts of wastewater were discharged into the river from households, industry, and agriculture.\n"},

This includes the appropriate treatment, transport, and disposal of the collected waste. South Korea's Waste Management Law was established in 1986, replacing the Environmental Protection Law (1963) and the Filth and Cleaning Law (1973). This new law aimed to reduce general waste under the  (or three 'R's) in South Korea. This Waste Management Law imposed a volume-based waste fee system, effective for waste produced by both household and industrial activities (or ).\nThe Waste Management Law began the regulation of systematic waste streams through basic principles in waste management practices, from reduction to disposal of waste. This law also encouraged  and resource conservation through a deposit-refund system and a landfill post-closure management system. \u00a0\nThe  (SMG) adapted the national policy on waste management to meet demands for an improved waste disposal system in the 1990s. In order to satisfy the public,  concentrated its waste management policy on  and utilisation. Originally, solid waste was not an environmental concern in South Korea. There was no concern for  with amount of solid waste being generated and dumped in .\nThe South Korean government only changed an amount of waste disposal services for household waste disposal despite the large amount being generated. This was significant during the Korean economic boom which created an increase in the production of municipal solid waste. Between 1970 and 1990, the amount of municipal solid waste generated grew from 12,000 tons to 84,000 tons per day. This led to the rise of waste disposal issues in South Korea. The low recycling rate and increased solid waste generation contributed greatly to . As landfills were heavily relied on, the ground and water were polluted.  was also affected as landfills contributed to hazardous gas emissions with unpredicted fires.\nThe  is one of the major streams in South Korea, a main drinking source in the . Over the past decades,  and  along the Nakdong river has caused pollution of the stream.  and , along with urban and agricultural drainage, led to the deterioration of the river.\nOn March 1, 2008, a chemical factory explosion caused a  leak into the Nakdong river. The incident caused  to leak, leading to major health concerns for the public. Tests also found that  also leaked into the river, but concluded that the harmful substances were diluted as the amount water discharged was increased. This is the second time the river has been contaminated by phenol.\nIn 1991, a phenol leak was the result of the bursting of an underground pipe, leaking pure phenol into the river. This disastrous leak rendered the water undrinkable. South Korea was previously careless with its dumping of waste into the water and air, and The Korea Times also discovered the illegal dumping of non-toxic waste along Nakdong river by 343 factories. Water quality quickly became a priority, and water quality has slowly improved with the installation of water treatment plants.\n is a  found in Seoul. It is positioned as a safe tap water supply for the citizens of Seoul. Arisu sources its water from the , and it goes through several water tests to ensure drinkable water quality as recommended by the  (WHO). Substances tested for include , , and . Arisu also manages water flow rate systematically, and controls water quality in purification centres. Aside from that, the Seoul Metropolitan Government operates multiple water treatment plants and Sewage Treatment Centres to ensure improvement of water quality.\nThe volume-based waste fee system (VBWF) was implemented in 1995 by the Korean government. This was made in an attempt to reduce waste generation and encourage recycling amongst its citizens. Municipal waste is collected in synthetic bags, and recyclables are separated and sorted in . All disposals, with an exception of recyclables, bulky items, and coal briquettes, are disposed according to the VBWF system. Items are measured with different volume sized bags, and citizens are then charged respectively.\nA decade after the introduction and implementation of the VBWF system, waste generation rates were reduced, and recycling rates improved dramatically. The public's awareness for the environment increased and technologies for recycling improved.  bags were introduced, and excessive packaging of products was also reduced. Refillable products are now preferred to reduce the generation of waste. The VBWF system increased Korean citizens' willingness to recycle, leading to a decreased burden on  or landfills.\n\nJongnyangje (: \uc885\ub7c9\uc81c) is an organised waste management system for the effective collection and reuse of waste and resources in South Korea. All waste must be separated into general waste, food waste, recyclable items, or bulky items. Bulky items consist of waste that are too big to fit into the issued disposal bags, such as furniture, electrical appliances, and office items. These bulky items require special stickers attainable from district offices. Recycling is necessary in South Korea, and recyclable items are divided according to material type, from paper to . is collected separately from general waste in special bags. These food disposal bags are known as eumsigmul sseulegi bongtu (: \uc74c\uc2dd\ubb3c \uc4f0\ub808\uae30 \ubd09\ud22c), and prices of these bags vary by size and district. A monthly fee respective to the amount of food wasted is then charged to each household, enabled through a Radio Frequency Identification () card.\nApart from charging fees for food wastage, South Korea also reduces food waste by reprocessing collected food into  feed. Since the South Korean government banned the dumping of food waste in landfills in 2005 and implemented food waste recycling in 2013, the amount of food waste being recycled increased dramatically. Citizens are encouraged to include only what animals can eat in these food disposal bags; , pits of fruits, and , hence cannot be as considered food waste. The collected waste is then dried out and repurposed into feed appropriate for animal consumption.\nSome food waste is turned into a  or food waste  instead, after it has gone through processing and all moisture is removed. This  food waste fertiliser is an  and  option in  of crops.\nSouth Korea ranks second in place for largest waste producer worldwide, with South Koreans using an average of 420 plastic bags annually. In order to counter this, South Korea banned all single-use plastic bags in . Alternatives such as paper bags, multiple-use cloth shopping bags or recyclable containers will be offered instead, and profits will be funded towards waste disposal. This law was introduced with the intention of putting an end to  garbage in the world, as well as to manage and preserve  and recyclable waste. This move was also the result of a revised law on the conservation of resources, and reuse of recyclable waste.\nThe law was implemented following a plastic waste handling crisis after  banned the importation of plastic garbage. This waste crisis caused South Korea's recycling firms to stop collecting garbage due to the financial loss incurred from the decrease in plastic prices. This resulted in plastic waste being left on the streets for weeks. The South Korean government was forced to come up with more  ways to manage plastic waste instead of shipping it overseas.\n (or electronic waste) includes electrical or electronic devices or waste. Managing e-waste or  (WEEE) is a major concern due to the magnitude of waste stream involved, as well as the toxic chemicals in the devices. Chemicals include , , , , , , and bromated . Discarded devices such as old computers, smartphones, and electrical appliances, may leak toxic chemicals if left in landfills. Items such as batteries and cell phones require additional care in disposal. To prevent leakage, the Seoul city government has partnered with SR Center to collect e-waste. Seoul city discards 10 tons of e-waste annually, with only a fifth of e-waste ending up in the special recycling centre. Devices are taken apart at the special recycling centre, where valuable metals such as , , or rare resources can be extracted.\nMany parts of the world are researching on feasible and environmentally friendly ways to dispose of e-waste for the WEEE management system. Recycling processes have been established in several countries, but the WEEE waste management system has not been introduced in most countries. In response to the growing concern of electronic waste, \u2018the Act on Resource Recycling of Waste Electrical Electronic Equipment (WEEE) and End-of-life Vehicles\u2019 was introduced in 2007. This act is aimed at reducing the amount of e-waste ending up in landfills and incinerators, and improving the performance and lifespan of such electronic devices.\nThe Waste Management Law was first introduced in 1986. It provided a framework that waste management was not only about containment, but reducing waste as well. Since its introduction in 1986, there is more practice of systematic and integrated waste management in South Korea. The South Korean government also funded projects to promote this method of waste management. It covered all waste streams, from municipal solid waste to , , and infectious waste. In 1991, the Act on Treatment of Livestock Manure, Wastewater and Sewage to manage manure waste separately. In 1992, the Act on Resource Saving and Recycling Promotion was enacted to consider waste as a resource. Based on this act, the volume-based waste fee system was implemented with a pay as you throw concept which provided legal support for those who resided near waste disposal sites, with the NIMBY (not in my back yard) issues.\nSouth Korea is working its way to becoming a zero-waste society, aiming to achieve a 3% landfill rate and 87% recycle rate by 2020. This ratification is set to be extended to the year 2025 due to conflicts and setbacks between stakeholders.\nThe South Korean Ministry of Environment (MOE) promoted a waste-to-energy policy to boost South Korea's self-sufficiency rate. The policy aims to reduce the cost of waste disposal through incineration and landfills. To generate electricity, fuel, and heating, waste gas, wood scraps, household waste, and other wastes are used in the conversion to energy. Energy production through waste is 10% cheaper than , and 66% cheaper than . This proves to be the most effective way of producing energy. In 2012, only 3.18% of new and renewable energy was produced, but the South Korean government hopes to increase the percentage to 20% by 2050.\nChina has been the dumping ground for the world's plastic for the longest time. In the 1990s, China saw discarded plastic as profitable, and the Chinese recreated the plastic into smaller, exportable bits and pieces. It was also cheaper for countries to export their plastic to China than discard it themselves. In November 2017, China stopped accepting contaminated plastic. This rejected plastic becomes absorbed by neighbouring countries like Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines, and South Korea. Now, Southeast Asian countries are starting to reject this waste as well. In August 2018, Vietnam introduced strict restrictions on plastic scrap imports. Thailand followed suit, announcing a ban on electronic parts. In October 2018, Malaysia also announced a ban on imports of plastic scraps.\nIn early January 2019, the Philippines rejected 1,200 tons of South Korean waste deemed non-recyclable. It was shipped back to South Korea in 51 trash-filled containers. In addition, 5,100 tons of South Korean waste had been found to be imported illegally by the Philippines. This waste included batteries, bulbs, used dextrose tubes, electronic equipment and nappies. South Korea and the Philippines are in talks about how the waste should be repatriated.\n"},

To combat increased levels of waste, a recycling program began in 1989, following a 1987 amendment to the Waste Disposal Act.  started as a private effort, but the initiative soon became overrun with fraud and other scandals due to ineffective government regulation. The private organizations and industries in charge of the program were free to falsely report recycling rates. The government established the 3R Foundation () in 1994 to discourage instances of fraud and other scandals. Recyclables were reclassified into eight groups: containers, tires, pesticide containers, lubricant oil, lead-acid batteries, vehicles, home appliances, and communication products. Each of these materials were the responsibility of one commission, and the commissions themselves were overseen by the . Taiwan's limited space to build trash incinerators and  were recognized as a problem, but from the 1980s and as late as 1996, waste was freely placed in the streets for collection. At the time, Taiwan had five incinerators in operation; at full capacity, only 10% of annual combustible waste was disposed of via incineration. Other methods of garbage disposal placed a large amount of stress on existing landfills. The eight separate committees initially established by recyclable material were eventually merged into the Resource Recycling Fund Management Committee. General oversight of the recycling program has been placed under the purview of the Resource Recycling Fund Management Committee, but a separate committee handles the establishment of recycling fees, and another committee is called on to periodically audit the recycling program itself.\nPeople are responsible for bringing their own trash to the collection point. In some areas such as Taipei City, nonrecyclables must be collected in colour-coded bags that can be bought at convenience stores. Raw food waste is processed to be further used as  by . Cooked food waste is processed to be further turned into food for . Not all recyclables are collected daily; the most common recyclables have a specially designated pickup day. There are 33 items considered recyclable, which in turn fall into 13 categories.\nGarbage collection trucks are known to play music to alert people of their presence at collection points.

In 2016 this ministry released the Solid Wastage Management (SWM) Rules, 2016, these rules replaced the Municipal Solid Wastages (Management and Handling) Rules, 2000 which had been in place for 16 years. This national policy is notable in that it has acknowledged and included the informal sector () into the waste management process for the first time.\nUrban India (about 377 million people) generates 62 million tonnes of  (MSW) each year. Of this about 43 million tonnes (70%) is collected and 11.9 million tonnes (20%) is treated. About 31 million tonnes (50%) is dumped in landfill sites.\nWith changing consumption patterns and rapid economic growth it is estimated that urban municipal solid waste generation will increase to 165 million tonnes in 2030.\nAverage waste is about 450 grams of waste per person per day. However, there is much variability in per capita: daily household  generation ranges from 170 grams per person in small towns to 620 grams per person in large cities.\nA 2007 study of  (cities with a population of over 1 million inhabitants) estimates MSW composition (by weight) to be 41% organic or , 40% , 6% paper, 4% plastic, 4% textiles, 2% glass, 2% metals and 1% leather.\nAccording to a more recent India  MSW study (2014) 51% of MSW was organic or biodegradable, 32% is inert or non-organic and 17% is recyclable waste.\nThe global  monitor, a collaboration between the  (ITU) and the , estimated that India generated 1.975 million tonnes of e-waste in 2016 or approximately 1.5\u00a0kg of e-waste per capita.\nAccording to the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry () rapid economic growth and changing consumer behavior was likely to increase e-waste generation in India to 5.2 million tonnes per year by 2020.\nSolid Waste Management Rules were inaugurated in 2016. Highlights include:\nBy 2025, the waste management market size in India is projected to be worth ~USD 15 Billion with annual growth around 7 percent.\nA growing economy, soaring urban population, rising living standards and increasing consumption levels are common trends in emerging economies across the globe. With India flourishing on the same grounds, an increase in the purchasing power parity has led to more affordability, accessibility to resource use and a rapid surge in the waste volumes as well. Considering the current trend toward urbanization in India, the MSW quantum is expected to double the existing volumes within ten years. At approximately 80-85 MTs by 2030, this represents a business opportunity estimated at US$20 Billion.\nIn 2014 India inaugurated the , a five-year nationwide cleanup effort. Before this national consolidated effort for systematic and total waste management came into common consciousness, many cities and towns in India had already launched individual efforts directed at municipal waste collection of segregated waste, either based on citizen activism and/or municipal efforts to set up sustainable systems. Some examples are Swach based in Pune (formed in 1993), , , , ,  and  (formed in 2009). Bangalore's  was directed by the High Court of  to implement mandatory segregation of municipal waste at the household level before collection - a first for the country. This was a direct effort of citizen-based activism at a local level, and the litigation was led by notable activists such as  and . Following this High Court ruling, other cities in India have followed suit to make segregation of municipal waste mandatory at the generator level,   being a notable example.\n launched a web based application in 2016 to track and monitor waste management in India. The application, , collects information and assists in coordinating waste generators, recyclers, operators of disposal facilities and state agencies. \u00a0\nPublic-private partnerships (PPP) have been promoted by the Government of India for improving waste management services, but have remained problematic. Given that the challenges of improving solid waste management services in India are primarily caused by lack of financial resources, lack of appropriate skills and technological competencies with the public sector, governments have started to explore PPPs as an alternative. However, the progress and improvement achieved was very low. Research on this topic has uncovered some serious issues and resulted in some major recommendations. For example, PPP in MSW is considered quite immature and yet high pre-qualification requirements were established. Moreover, the urban local bodies (ULBs) found difficulties in defining an appropriate scope for some PPP projects. The specific issue encounteres include a dire need of services are the primary reason behind opting for PPP mode; the perception that PPP gives greater benefit to the public; third and interconnected: PPPs avoid financial stress on the public sector; and fourth, PPPs are thought to constrain transaction costs and give value for the money invested. The research also revealed some serious negative issues that have crept-in while using PPP mode. They are often procured in an incompetent manner, and as opposed to the expectation, they have resulted in high transaction costs and ineffective projects. Lastly, the private sector  appeared to be exploiting the sector without any beneficial projects. There are so many other facets that are yet to be understood while using PPP in the waste management sector.\n"},

Radioactive waste contains a mixture of short-lived and long-lived , as well as non-radioactive nuclides. There was reported some 47,000 tonnes of high-level nuclear waste stored in the United States 2002.\nThe most troublesome  in spent fuel are  (half-life two million years) and  (half-life 24,000 years). Consequently, high-level radioactive waste requires sophisticated treatment and management to successfully isolate it from the . This usually necessitates treatment, followed by a long-term management strategy involving permanent storage, disposal or transformation of the waste into a non-toxic form.   follows the  rule, which means that the rate of decay is inversely proportional to the duration of decay. In other words, the radiation from a long-lived  like iodine-129 will be much less intense than that of short-lived isotope like .\nGovernments around the world are considering a range of waste management and disposal options, usually involving , although there has been limited progress toward implementing long-term waste management solutions. This is partly because the timeframes in question when dealing with radioactive waste range from 10,000 to millions of years, according to studies based on the effect of estimated radiation doses.\nThus, engineer and physicist  identified two fundamental prerequisites for effective management of high-level radioactive waste: (1) stable geological formations, and (2) stable human institutions over hundreds of thousands of years. As Alfv\u00e9n suggests, no known human civilization has ever endured for so long, and no geologic formation of adequate size for a permanent radioactive waste repository has yet been discovered that has been stable for so long a period. Nevertheless, avoiding confronting the risks associated with managing radioactive wastes may create countervailing risks of greater magnitude. Radioactive waste management is an example of policy analysis that requires special attention to ethical concerns, examined in the light of uncertainty and : consideration of 'the impacts of practices and technologies on future generations'.\nThere is a debate over what should constitute an acceptable scientific and engineering foundation for proceeding with radioactive waste disposal strategies. There are those who have argued, on the basis of complex geochemical simulation models, that relinquishing control over radioactive materials to geohydrologic processes at repository closure is an acceptable risk. They maintain that so-called \"natural analogues\" inhibit subterranean movement of radionuclides, making disposal of radioactive wastes in stable geologic formations unnecessary. However, existing models of these processes are empirically underdetermined: due to the subterranean nature of such processes in solid geologic formations, the accuracy of computer simulation models has not been verified by empirical observation, certainly not over periods of time equivalent to the lethal half-lives of high-level radioactive waste. On the other hand, some insist deep geologic repositories in stable geologic formations are necessary. National management plans of various countries display a variety of approaches to resolving this debate.\nResearchers suggest that forecasts of health detriment for such long periods . Practical studies only consider up to 100 years as far as effective planning and cost evaluations are concerned. Long term behaviour of radioactive wastes remains a subject for ongoing research. Management strategies and implementation plans of several representative national governments are described below.\nThe  has said:\nIt is widely accepted that spent nuclear fuel and high-level reprocessing and plutonium wastes require well-designed storage for periods ranging from tens of thousands to a million years, to minimize releases of the contained radioactivity into the environment. Safeguards are also required to ensure that neither plutonium nor highly enriched uranium is diverted to weapon use. There is general agreement that placing spent nuclear fuel in repositories hundreds of meters below the surface would be safer than indefinite storage of spent fuel on the surface.\nThe process of selecting appropriate permanent repositories for high level waste and spent fuel is now under way in several countries with the first expected to be commissioned some time after 2017. The basic concept is to locate a large, stable geologic formation and use mining technology to excavate a tunnel, or large-bore  (similar to those used to drill the  from England to France) to drill a shaft 500\u20131,000 meters below the surface where rooms or vaults can be excavated for disposal of high-level radioactive waste. The goal is to permanently isolate nuclear waste from the human environment. However, many people remain uncomfortable with the immediate  of this disposal system, suggesting perpetual management and monitoring would be more prudent.\nBecause some radioactive species have half-lives longer than one million years, even very low container leakage and radionuclide migration rates must be taken into account. Moreover, it may require more than one half-life until some nuclear materials lose enough radioactivity to no longer be lethal to living organisms. A 1983 review of the Swedish radioactive waste disposal program by the National Academy of Sciences found that country\u2019s estimate of several hundred thousand years\u2014perhaps up to one million years\u2014being necessary for waste isolation \"fully justified.\"\nThe proposed land-based subductive waste disposal method would dispose of nuclear waste in a  accessed from land, and therefore is not prohibited by international agreement. This method has been described as a viable means of disposing of radioactive waste, and as a state-of-the-art nuclear waste disposal technology.\nIn nature, sixteen repositories were discovered at the  mine in  where natural  reactions took place 1.7 billion years ago. The fission products in these natural formations were found to have moved less than 10\u00a0ft (3 m) over this period, though the lack of movement may be due more to retention in the  structure than to insolubility and sorption from moving ground water; uraninite crystals are better preserved here than those in  because of a less complete nuclear reaction, so that reaction products would be less accessible to groundwater attack.\n describes proposals to drill over one kilometer vertically, and two kilometers horizontally in the earth\u2019s crust, for the purpose of disposing of high-level waste forms such as , , or . After the emplacement and the retrievability period, drillholes would be backfilled and sealed. A series of tests of the technology were carried out in November 2018 and then again publicly in January 2019 by a U.S. based private company. The test demonstrated the emplacement of a test-canister in a horizontal drillhole and retrieval of the same canister. There was no actual high-level waste used in this test.\nIn order to store the high level radioactive waste in long-term geological depositories, specific waste forms need to be used which will allow the radioactivity to decay away while the materials retain their integrity for thousands of years. The materials being used can be broken down into a few classes: glass waste forms, ceramic waste forms, and nanostructured materials.\nThe  include borosilicate glasses and phosphate glasses. Borosilicate nuclear waste glasses are used on an industrial scale to immobilize high level radioactive waste in many countries which are producers of nuclear energy or have nuclear weaponry. The glass waste forms have the advantage of being able to accommodate a wide variety of waste-stream compositions, they are easy to scale up to industrial processing, and they are stable against thermal, radiative, and chemical perturbations. These glasses function by binding radioactive elements to nonradioactive glass-forming elements. Phosphate glasses while not being used industrially have much lower dissolution rates than borosilicate glasses, which make them a more favorable option. However, no single phosphate material has the ability to accommodate all of the radioactive products so phosphate storage requires more reprocessing to separate the waste into distinct fractions. Both glasses have to be processed at elevated temperatures making them unusable for some of the more volatile radiotoxic elements.\nThe  forms offer higher waste loadings than the glass options because ceramics have crystalline structure. Also, mineral analogues of the ceramic waste forms provide evidence for long term durability. Due to this fact and the fact that they can be processed at lower temperatures, ceramics are often considered the next generation in high level radioactive waste forms. Ceramic waste forms offer great potential, but a lot of research remains to be done.\nFinland, the United States and Sweden are the most advanced in developing a deep repository for high-level radioactive waste disposal. Countries vary in their plans on disposing used fuel directly or after reprocessing, with France and Japan having an extensive commitment to reprocessing. The country-specific status of high-level waste management plans are described below.\nIn many European countries (e.g., Britain, Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland) the risk or dose limit for a member of the public exposed to radiation from a future high-level nuclear waste facility is considerably more stringent than that suggested by the International Commission on Radiation Protection or proposed in the United States. European limits are often more stringent than the standard suggested in 1990 by the International Commission on Radiation Protection by a factor of 20, and more stringent by a factor of ten than the standard proposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for  for the first 10,000 years after closure. Moreover, the U.S. EPA\u2019s proposed standard for greater than 10,000 years is 250 times more permissive than the European limit.\nThe countries that have made the most progress towards a repository for high-level radioactive waste have typically started with  and made voluntary siting a necessary condition. This consensus seeking approach is believed to have a greater chance of success than top-down modes of decision making, but the process is necessarily slow, and there is \"inadequate experience around the world to know if it will succeed in all existing and aspiring nuclear nations\".\nMoreover,  a nuclear waste repository as they are \"concerned about their community becoming a de facto site for waste for thousands of years, the health and environmental consequences of an accident, and lower property values\".\nIn China (), ten reactors provide about 2% of electricity and five more are under construction. China made a commitment to reprocessing in the 1980s; a pilot plant is under construction at , where a temporary spent fuel storage facility has been constructed. Geological disposal has been studied since 1985, and a permanent deep geological repository was required by law in 2003. Sites in  Province near the  desert in northwestern China are under investigation, with a final site expected to be selected by 2020, and actual disposal by about 2050.\nIn  (),  was built at the Southern tip of  in , offshore of Taiwan Island. The facility was built in 1982 and it is owned and operated by . The facility receives  from Taipower's current three . However, due to the strong resistance from local community in the island, the nuclear waste has to be stored at the power plant facilities themselves.\nIndia adopted a closed fuel cycle, which involves reprocessing and recycling of the spent fuel. The reprocessing results in 2-3% of the spent fuel going to waste while the rest is recycled. The waste fuel, called high level liquid waste, is converted to glass through vitrification. Vitrified waste is then stored for a period of 30-40 years for cooling.\nSixteen nuclear reactors produce about 3% of India\u2019s electricity, and seven more are under construction. Spent fuel is processed at facilities in  near , at  on the west coast north of Mumbai, and at  on the southeast coast of India. Plutonium will be used in a fast breeder reactor (under construction) to produce more fuel, and other waste vitrified at Tarapur and Trombay. Interim storage for 30 years is expected, with eventual disposal in a  in crystalline rock near Kalpakkam.\nIn 2000, a Specified Radioactive Waste Final Disposal Act called for creation of a new organization to manage high level radioactive waste, and later that year the Nuclear Waste Management Organization of Japan (NUMO) was established under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. NUMO is responsible for selecting a permanent  site, construction, operation and closure of the facility for waste emplacement by 2040. Site selection began in 2002 and application information was sent to 3,239 municipalities, but by 2006, no local government had volunteered to host the facility.  showed interest in 2007, but its mayor resigned due to local opposition. In December 2013 the government decided to identify suitable candidate areas before approaching municipalities.\nThe head of the \u2019s expert panel has said Japan's seismic conditions makes it difficult to predict ground conditions over the necessary 100,000 years, so it will be impossible to convince the public of the safety of deep geological disposal.\nBelgium has seven nuclear reactors that provide about 52% of its electricity. Belgian spent nuclear fuel was initially sent for reprocessing in France. In 1993, reprocessing was suspended following a resolution of the Belgian parliament; spent fuel is since being stored on the sites of the nuclear power plants. The deep disposal of high-level radioactive waste (HLW) has been studied in Belgium for more than 30 years. Boom Clay is studied as a reference host formation for HLW disposal. The Hades underground research laboratory (URL) is located at \u2212223 m in the Boom Formation at the  site. The Belgian URL is operated by the Euridice , a joint organisation between , the Belgian Nuclear Research Centre which initiated the research on waste disposal in Belgium in the 1970s and 1980s and , the Belgian agency for radioactive waste management. In Belgium, the regulatory body in charge of guidance and licensing approval is the Federal Agency of Nuclear Control, created in 2001.\nIn 1983, the government decided to select a site for permanent repository by 2010. With four nuclear reactors providing 29% of its electricity, Finland in 1987 enacted a Nuclear Energy Act making the producers of radioactive waste responsible for its disposal, subject to requirements of its  and an absolute veto given to local governments in which a proposed repository would be located. Producers of nuclear waste organized the company , with responsibility for site selection, construction and operation of a permanent repository. A 1994 amendment to the Act required final disposal of spent fuel in Finland, prohibiting the import or export of radioactive waste.\nEnvironmental assessment of four sites occurred in 1997\u201398, Posiva chose the  site near two existing reactors, and the local government approved it in 2000. The Finnish Parliament approved a deep geologic repository there in igneous bedrock at a depth of about 500 meters in 2001. The repository concept is similar to the Swedish model, with containers to be clad in copper and buried below the water table beginning in 2020. An underground characterization facility, , was under construction at the site in 2012.\nWith , the highest percentage of any country, France has been reprocessing its spent reactor fuel since the introduction of nuclear power there. Some reprocessed plutonium is used to make fuel, but more is being produced than is being recycled as reactor fuel. France also reprocesses spent fuel for other countries, but the nuclear waste is returned to the country of origin. Radioactive waste from reprocessing French spent fuel is expected to be disposed of in a geological repository, pursuant to legislation enacted in 1991 that established a 15-year period for conducting radioactive waste management research. Under this legislation, partition and transmutation of long-lived elements, immobilization and conditioning processes, and long-term near surface storage are being investigated by  the Commissariat \u00e0 l\u2019Energie Atomique (CEA). Disposal in deep geological formations is being studied by the French agency for radioactive waste management, L'Agence Nationale pour la Gestion des D\u00e9chets Radioactifs, in underground research labs.\nThree sites were identified for possible deep geologic disposal in clay near the border of  and , near , and at . In 1998 the government approved the , a site near Meuse/Haute-Marne and dropped the others from further consideration. Legislation was proposed in 2006 to license a repository by 2020, with operations expected in 2035.\nNuclear waste policy in Germany is in flux. German planning for a permanent geologic repository began in 1974, focused on , a salt mine near Gorleben about 100 kilometers northeast of Braunschweig. The site was announced in 1977 with plans for a reprocessing plant, spent fuel management, and permanent disposal facilities at a single site. Plans for the reprocessing plant were dropped in 1979. In 2000, the federal government and utilities agreed to suspend underground investigations for three to ten years, and the government committed to ending its use of nuclear power, closing one reactor in 2003.\nWithin days of the March 2011 , Chancellor  \"imposed a three-month moratorium on previously announced extensions for Germany's existing nuclear power plants, while shutting seven of the 17 reactors that had been operating since 1981\". Protests continued and, on 29 May 2011, Merkel's government announced that it would close all of its nuclear power plants by 2022.\nMeanwhile, electric utilities have been transporting spent fuel to interim storage facilities at Gorleben, Lubmin and Ahaus until temporary storage facilities can be built near reactor sites. Previously, spent fuel was sent to France or the United Kingdom for reprocessing, but this practice was ended in July 2005.\n () is the  interim nuclear waste processing and storage company in , which stores the waste produced in their  after it is reprocessed by  in , , , . Until the  decides what to do with the waste, it will stay at COVRA, which currently has a license to operate for one hundred years. As of early 2017, there are no plans for a permanent disposal facility.\nIn Russia, the Ministry of Atomic Energy () is responsible for 31 nuclear reactors which generate about 16% of its electricity. Minatom is also responsible for reprocessing and radioactive waste disposal, including over 25,000 tons of spent nuclear fuel in temporary storage in 2001.\nRussia has a long history of reprocessing spent fuel for military purposes, and previously planned to reprocess imported spent fuel, possibly including some of the 33,000 metric tons of spent fuel accumulated at sites in other countries who received fuel from the U.S., which the U.S. originally pledged to take back, such as Brazil, the Czech Republic, India, Japan, Mexico, Slovenia, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the European Union.\nAn Environmental Protection Act in 1991 prohibited importing radioactive material for long-term storage or burial in Russia, but controversial legislation to allow imports for permanent storage was passed by the Russian Parliament and signed by President Putin in 2001. In the long term, the Russian plan is for deep geologic disposal. Most attention has been paid to locations where waste has accumulated in temporary storage at Mayak, near Chelyabinsk in the Ural Mountains, and in granite at Krasnoyarsk in Siberia.\n has  with seven  which produced 21% of the country's electricity in 2013. Furthermore, there is legacy high-level waste from another two older, closed plants. Between 2004 and 2011, a bipartisan initiative of the  promoted the construction of an interim centralized storage facility (ATC, ), similar to the Dutch  concept. In late 2011 and early 2012 the final green light was given, preliminary studies were being completed and land was purchased near  () after a competitive tender process. The facility would be initially licensed for 60 years.\nHowever, soon before groundbreaking was slated to begin in 2015, the project was stopped because of a mix of geological, technical, political and ecological problems. By late 2015, the  considered it \"obsolete\" and effectively \"paralyzed.\" As of early 2017, the project has not been shelved but it stays frozen and no further action is expected anytime soon. Meanwhile, the spent nuclear fuel and other high-level waste is being kept in the plants' pools, as well as on-site  () in  and .\nAs of early 2017, there are no plans for a permanent high-level disposal facility either. Low- and medium-level waste is stored in the  facility (.)\nIn , as of 2007 there are ten operating nuclear reactors that produce about 45% of its electricity. Two other reactors in  were shut down in 1999 and 2005. When these reactors were built, it was expected their nuclear fuel would be reprocessed in a foreign country, and the reprocessing waste would not be returned to Sweden. Later, construction of a domestic reprocessing plant was contemplated, but has not been built.\nPassage of the Stipulation Act of 1977 transferred responsibility for nuclear waste management from the government to the nuclear industry, requiring reactor operators to present an acceptable plan for waste management with \"absolute safety\" in order to obtain an operating license. In early 1980, after the  meltdown in the United States, a referendum was held on the future use of nuclear power in Sweden. In late 1980, after a three-question referendum produced mixed results, the Swedish Parliament decided to phase out existing reactors by 2010. In 2010, the Swedish government opened up for construction of new nuclear reactors. The new units can only be built at the existing nuclear power sites, Oskarshamn, Ringhals or Forsmark, and only to replace one of the existing reactors, that will have to be shut down for the new one to be able to start up.\nThe . (Svensk K\u00e4rnbr\u00e4nslehantering AB, known as SKB) was created in 1980 and is responsible for final disposal of nuclear waste there. This includes operation of a monitored retrievable storage facility, the Central Interim Storage Facility for Spent Nuclear Fuel at , about 150 miles south of Stockholm on the Baltic coast; transportation of spent fuel; and construction of a permanent repository. Swedish utilities store spent fuel at the reactor site for one year before transporting it to the facility at Oskarshamn, where it will be stored in excavated caverns filled with water for about 30 years before removal to a permanent repository.\nConceptual design of a permanent repository was determined by 1983, calling for placement of copper-clad iron canisters in granite bedrock about 500 metres underground, below the water table in what is known as the  method. Space around the canisters will be filled with  clay. After examining six possible locations for a permanent repository, three were nominated for further investigation, at , Oskarshamn, and . On 3 June 2009, Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Co. chose a location for a deep-level waste site at \u00d6sthammar, near Forsmark Nuclear Power plant. The application to build the repository was handed in by SKB 2011.\nSwitzerland has five nuclear reactors that provide about 43% of its electricity around 2007 (34% in 2015). Some Swiss spent nuclear fuel has been sent for reprocessing in France and the United Kingdom; most fuel is being stored without reprocessing. An industry-owned organization, ZWILAG, built and operates a central interim storage facility for spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste, and for conditioning low-level radioactive waste and for incinerating wastes. Other interim storage facilities predating ZWILAG continue to operate in Switzerland.\nThe Swiss program is considering options for the siting of a deep repository for high-level radioactive waste disposal, and for low & intermediate level wastes. Construction of a repository is not foreseen until well into this century. Research on sedimentary rock (especially Opalinus Clay) is carried out at the Swiss ; the Grimsel Test Site, an older facility in crystalline rock is also still active.\nGreat Britain has 19 operating reactors, producing about 20% of its electricity. It processes much of its spent fuel at  on the northwest coast across from Ireland, where nuclear waste is vitrified and sealed in stainless steel canisters for dry storage above ground for at least 50 years before eventual deep geologic disposal. Sellafield has a history of environmental and safety problems, including a fire in a nuclear plant in , and a significant incident in 2005 at the main reprocessing plant (THORP).\nIn 1982 the Nuclear Industry Radioactive Waste Management Executive (NIREX) was established with responsibility for disposing of long-lived nuclear waste and in 2006 a Committee on Radioactive Waste Management (CoRWM) of the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs recommended geologic disposal 200\u20131,000 meters underground. NIREX developed a generic repository concept based on the Swedish model but has not yet selected a site. A Nuclear Decommissioning Authority is responsible for packaging waste from reprocessing and will eventually relieve British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. of responsibility for power reactors and the Sellafield reprocessing plant.\nThe 18 operating nuclear power plants in  generated about 16% of its electricity in 2006. A national Nuclear Fuel Waste Act was enacted by the  in 2002, requiring nuclear energy corporations to create a waste management organization to propose to the Government of Canada approaches for management of nuclear waste, and implementation of an approach subsequently selected by the government. The Act defined management as \"long term management by means of storage or disposal, including handling, treatment, conditioning or transport for the purpose of storage or disposal.\"\nThe resulting  (NWMO) conducted an extensive three-year study and consultation with Canadians. In 2005, they recommended Adaptive Phased Management, an approach that emphasized both technical and management methods. The technical method included centralized isolation and containment of spent nuclear fuel in a deep geologic repository in a suitable rock formation, such as the granite of the  or  sedimentary rocks. Also recommended was a phased decision making process supported by a program of continuous learning, research and development.\nIn 2007, the Canadian government accepted this recommendation, and NWMO was tasked with implementing the recommendation. No specific timeframe was defined for the process. In 2009, the NWMO was designing the process for site selection; siting was expected to take 10 years or more.\nThe  of 1982 established a timetable and procedure for constructing a permanent, underground repository for high-level radioactive waste by the mid-1990s, and provided for some temporary storage of waste, including spent fuel from 104 civilian nuclear reactors that produce about 19.4% of electricity there. The United States in April 2008 had about 56,000 metric tons of spent fuel and 20,000 canisters of solid defense-related waste, and this is expected to increase to 119,000 metric tons by 2035. The U.S. opted for , a final repository at  in , but this project was widely opposed, with some of the main concerns being long distance transportation of waste from across the United States to this site, the possibility of accidents, and the uncertainty of success in isolating nuclear waste from the human environment in perpetuity. Yucca Mountain, with capacity for 70,000 metric tons of radioactive waste, was expected to open in 2017. However, the  rejected use of the site in the 2009  proposal, which eliminated all funding except that needed to answer inquiries from the , \"while the Administration devises a new strategy toward nuclear waste disposal.\" On March 5, 2009,   told a Senate hearing \"the Yucca Mountain site no longer was viewed as an option for storing reactor waste.\"  Starting in 1999, military-generated nuclear waste is being entombed at the  in New Mexico.\nSince the fraction of a radioisotope's atoms decaying per unit of time is inversely proportional to its half-life, the relative radioactivity of a quantity of buried human radioactive waste would diminish over time compared to natural radioisotopes (such as the decay chains of 120 trillion tons of thorium and 40 trillion tons of uranium which are  over the crust's 3 * 10 ton mass). For instance, over a timeframe of thousands of years, after the most active short half-life radioisotopes decayed, burying U.S. nuclear waste would increase the radioactivity in the top 2000 feet of rock and soil in the United States (10 million km) by  1 part in 10 million over the cumulative amount of  in such a volume, although the vicinity of the site would have a far higher concentration of artificial radioisotopes underground than such an average.\nIn a Presidential Memorandum dated January 29, 2010,  established the  (the Commission). The Commission, composed of fifteen members, conducted an extensive two-year study of nuclear waste disposal, what is referred to as the \"back end\" of the nuclear energy process.  The Commission established three subcommittees: Reactor and Fuel Cycle Technology, Transportation and Storage, and Disposal. On January 26, 2012, the Commission submitted its final report to Energy Secretary Steven Chu. In the Disposal Subcommittee\u2019s final report the Commission does not issue recommendations for a specific site but rather presents a comprehensive recommendation for disposal strategies. During their research the Commission visited Finland, France, Japan, Russia, Sweden, and the UK.  In their final report the Commission put forth seven recommendations for developing a comprehensive strategy to pursue:\nAlthough Australia does not have any nuclear power reactors,  considered siting an international repository in the outback of South Australia or Western Australia in 1998, but this stimulated legislative opposition in both states and the  during the following year. Thereafter, Pangea ceased operations in Australia but reemerged as Pangea International Association, and in 2002 evolved into the Association for Regional and International Underground Storage with support from Belgium, Bulgaria, Hungary, Japan and Switzerland. A general concept for an international repository has been advanced by one of the principals in all three ventures. Russia has expressed interest in serving as a repository for other countries, but does not envision sponsorship or control by an international body or group of other countries. South Africa, Argentina and western China have also been mentioned as possible locations.\nIn the EU,  is negotiating a European-wide waste disposal system with single disposal sites that can be used by several EU-countries. This EU-wide storage possibility is being researched under the SAPIERR-2 program.\n\n"},

Methods of inspection, as well as ecological and economic standards have been developed in the country for all categories of liquid and gaseous waste products. At the same time, solid waste produced by the mining, concentrating, refining and power industries has accumulated all over the country without controls. This is largely caused by the following factors:\nThe issue of solid waste accumulation is of special concern in  given its economy's reliance on extraction and processing industries, which produce a huge amount of waste. About 21 billion tons of solid waste of all types has accumulated in the country. Its incremental growth amounts to 1 billion tons a year (Annex).

For the last year city dumps accumulated 470 thousand tons of solid waste.\nBy today there are  in the country,   environmental and health standards. Only 603 polygons () meet the health standards at some extent, and are authorized to emissions to the environment.\nThe power sector in  is one of the main sources of  through its emissions of , ,  and ash. In 1990 the energy sector emitted around 2.3 million tons of such pollution, accounting for 35% of total atmospheric emissions and 53% of emissions from stationary sources. In 1996, there were about 1 million tons emitted, or 28% of the total volume of emissions and 41% of emissions from stationary sources. Much of this pollution is caused by the use of low quality coal as the main fuel, and also by poorly equipped thermal power stations with systems of purification of volatile gases of boiler-houses.\nDue to decreases in thermal and electric power production the amounts of pollutants emitted by the energy sector have decreased by almost 50%. Nevertheless, the atmospheric pollution problem caused by the energy sector remains severe.\nWeight of pollutants from heating and power generation enterprises, ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy and oil and gas sector\n\n are a group of chemicals - industrial substances such as ,  of the  type and harmful waste products of dioxin type - the compounds and mixtures of which have toxic properties, are resistant to decomposition and higher . As a result of transboundary transfer by air and water, they settle long distances from their emission points, accumulating in water and land ecosystems. The major sources of pollution by persistent organic contaminants in  are agriculture and outdated production processes.\nThe majority of pesticides used in  are herbicides and insecticides. In the last two decades the volume of pesticide usage decreased almost fourfold. According to the Customs Committee, a total of 5346 million kg of persistent organic contaminants were imported in 2000, including 4,026,346\u00a0kg of herbicides, 64,702\u00a0kg of fungicides, 598,645\u00a0kg of insecticides, 10,000\u00a0kg of defoliants and 646,556\u00a0kg of other pesticides. In the first quarter of 2002 more than 6.36 million kg of pesticides were imported.\nAccording to official data, only permitted compounds are imported to . \n\nOut of 21 billion tons of industrial wastes accumulated in the country, 5.2 billion are toxic. In 1999, the annual volume of toxic wastes amounted to 92 million tons, of which 60% were wastes of metallurgic industries.\nThe development of the mining industry in the Republic determines the quality and condition of the land, causing pollution by such toxic substances as radioactive nuclides, heavy metals, etc. The mining industry has accumulated 4 billion tons of waste; concentration plants have accumulated 1.1 billion tons of waste and metallurgical industries have accumulated 105 million tons. \n\nThe total area of the ecological disaster zone is 7 million hectares, including the territory of the test site (1.8 million hectares) and the zones of emergency-level and maximum radiation risk (5.2 million hectares). Some 27.4 million hectares of agricultural land is registered in the impact zone of the Semipalatinsk testing ground (88.3% of the total area of the region).\nBy the Government Decree of the  No.172 of February 7, 1996 the Semipalatinsk test site lands became reserve lands and measures were identified to improve the ecological situation in the districts located in the zones of emergency-level and maximum radiation risk. The difficulty of full economic land development on the test site is that a radiological diagnostic study has not been completed in the area and the norms of the maximum permissible pollution of the lands have not been established. Due to the transfer of part of the Semipalatinsk test site lands to economic use, the priority objective is to conduct detailed studies and develop measures on the safe implementation of economic activity in these areas. Due to lack of funding such measures have not yet materialized.\nThe  was established on August 21, 1947. Covering three oblasts-Western Kazakhstan, Karaganda and Pavlodar,  occupies an area of 18,500 km2 with a perimeter of 600\u00a0km. The Polygon occupies 10,000 km2 of the former Semipalatinsk oblast. Nuclear tests were performed over the period between 1949 and 1989, with around 470 systems, including 30 surface, 86 air and 340 subsurface devices detonated. The power of the explosions reached 17,400,000 tons of trinitrotoluene equivalent. Initially, nuclear tests were performed to test nuclear explosive systems and armament samples, and later for economic purposes.\nThese tests resulted in the formation of the \u201catomic lake\u201d Balapan, plus radioactive gas emissions in the air, environmental imbalance and negative health implications for people living in areas adjoining the  site.\nReports indicate gamma-radiation levels many times exceeding the norm - up to 1,250 mcr/hr in Semiplatinsk in 1960-1980, which exceed the background level approximately 100 times, and up to 60,000 mcr/hr in Sarapan village. Pollution with radioactive isotopes of caesium and strontium exceeding the threshold was identified in Shagan and Aschisu rivers, Balapan Lake and other water sources within the SNTP site. At least 4,500 km2 of the Polygon area (land, rocks, water) are polluted with Cs-137 and Sr-90 in concentrations exceeding the threshold.\nThe environmental and agricultural implications and consequences of activities carried out at the Polygon are remarkable. Nuclear tests affected not only the Polygon's natural landscapes, existing ecosystems and agriculture, but also lands adjacent to the Polygon. Radionuclide pollution of milk and meat produced on farms located near the SNTP was sometimes registered at levels exceeding both the background level and safety requirements.\nCurrently, there is a clear need for the following to be carried out at the SNTP:\n\nThree test sites were operating on the borders of Western Kazakhstan and Atyrau oblasts in the Naryn area: Azgir nuclear testing site, a state test-flight center and a state central testing ground, the last two belong to the Russian complex , and are still in operation. 29 nuclear explosions were conducted on the territory of these sites (18 underground, 11 in the atmosphere). Within the framework of research 10 nuclear explosions were additionally performed: 6 in Karachaganak, 3 in Mangistau and 1 in Aktubinsk oblasts.\n\nSpace and rocket equipment is considered to be among the most powerful source of the man-made impact on the global climate, environment and economies. There are 17 cosmodromes (space-vehicle launching sites or space centers) in the world.\nOver the period 1957 to 2001, 1189 space rockets were launched from  to put into orbit 1237 space ships on various assignments. These launches also included more than 100 intercontinental ballistic rockets. From 2000 to 2001, 30% of the world's space rocket launching was carried out from Baikonur space center.\nThe location of space centers on the coasts of , , ,  and  was done purposefully in order to reduce damage from accidents and prevent the fall of rocket stages and products of combustion in the residential areas. Only three countries \u2013 ,  and  - launch from landlocked continental space centers exposing the population of their countries to danger and polluting inhabited areas.\n\n\nThe state program \u00abDevelopment Strategy 2030\u00bb identifies the following major public policy goals in the area of environmental protection and efficient natural resource use: stabilizing the quality of the environment, ensuring a favorable environment for human activity and preserving natural resources for future generations. Between 1994 and 2001 the , recognizing the importance of natural resource conservation and its obligations to the international community, ratified 19 environmental conventions embracing preservation of all natural components, including transboundary elements.\nPolicy in the area of stabilizing environmental quality is aimed at:\nThe following documents have been prepared with the assistance of the international donor community: a National Environmental Action Plan for Sustainable Development, national strategies and action plans for , combating , as well as forest and mountain ecosystem protection. The main  strategy documents - a Sustainable Development Framework and Agenda 21 are currently being developed.\n\nCurrently, major environmental payments are centralized to feed into the national budget. The Code for Taxes and Other Mandatory Budgetary Payments distinguishes the following environmental payments:\n\nThe Constitution of the , which was adopted in 1995, forms the basis of national environmental legislation. Article 31 of the Constitution states that \u201cthe state shall set an objective to protect the environment favorable for the life and health of the citizen\". Consequently, though the right to an environment favorable for life and health is not stipulated as a constitutional right, the fundamental law affirms the responsibility of the state to provide favorable environmental conditions for its citizens. The Constitution also states that officials shall be held accountable for the concealment of facts and circumstances endangering the life and health of the people. The access of the citizens of  to information on the environmental situation is viewed as a guarantee of the implementation of state policy on environmental protection.\nIn addition to the above-mentioned law,  has adopted a number of specific laws in the area of environmental protection:\n\nThe Criminal Code in force from July 16, 1997 includes a special Article (#11) on environmental crime. This Article covers the following types of environmental offences:\n\n has practically no waste recycling enterprises. The few currently operating recyclers face a number of financial and organizational constraints. For instance, in Pavlodar there are two enterprises employing unique technologies (up to 96% of waste is used in the production process). They are: Pavlodar Ash-Sludge Waste Processing Plant JSC and EMEKO JSC. The base raw materials used by these enterprises are bauxite slime of\nAluminum of Kazakhstan JSC and ash waste of Pavlodar TES-1, resulting from combustion of Ekibastuz coal with a high ash content. The plant produces 14 kinds of construction materials, such as brick (including fire-resistant), cement, etc. Provided the plant operates on a two-shift basis, it can annually process 32,000 tons of slime and 38 tons of ash. However, it cannot operate at full capacity due to lack of working capital.\nEnterprises of the ore dressing and metallurgical complexes, petrochemical, heat-and-power generating facilities, coal pits, etc. use industrial waste for the mining-technical reclamation of tailings, ash dumps, overburden dumps and hosting rocks. Thus, in waste-intensive areas (East Kazakhstan, Karaganda, Kostanai and Pavlodar oblasts) the percentage of industrial waste usage varies, from 1.5-2% in Pavlodar oblast to 25% in Karaganda oblast. A high level of waste utilization has been achieved in this oblast in the last two years mainly due to the use of overburden and hosting rocks for technical reclamation of up to 85% of the used and disturbed land.\nThe metallurgical slime stored on test sites is usually buried. This is largely due to lack of efficient and cost-effective recycling technologies. A small part of the waste is used in production and construction technologies by Ispat-Karmet JSC (Karaganda oblast), where practically all metallurgical slag is processed and reused. Zhairem Tsvet \u041c\u0435\u0442 JSC and the Balkhash smelter of  process all the metallurgical slag accumulated throughout the year, together with ore, in the production of copper concentrate.\nThe following technologies of waste processing and neutralization are applied at Sokolovsko-Sarbaisky smelter (Kostanai Oblast): crushing of rocks for construction; use of mill tailings in the extraction of collective sulfide concentrate by a floatation unit and its further processing at the mining-chemical integrated works, although this technology has yet to be finalized.\nIn 2000 Maikainzoloto OJSC (Pavlodar Oblast) started to use off-balance ores from overburdened soil dumps, including dumps located in the Maikain settlement. Maikainzoloto JSC, jointly with Technopark- Stepnogorsk JSC, plans to apply environmentally friendly technology in the production of the copper-zinc concentrate without cyanides.\nFerrochrome JSC (Aktyube Oblast) is an example of successful industrial waste utilization and processing. This JSC has started to produce crushed stone from the scoria of high and low-carbon ferrochrome (more than\n150.0 tons per year) and ferrodust (more than 4,000 tons per year) which is further used in the manufacturing of lime-and-sand brick (more than 12,000 pieces per year). In addition, the company plans to use a bin for the reception and sorting out of the waste for further recycling. A dedicated area will be used to store metal scrap.\nPrivate sector participation in solid waste disposal helps to raise significantly the efficiency of recycling. For instance, in Pavlodar the situation improved after solid waste management was transferred to Polygon MDS JSC (accumulator of solid waste of III-IV class of hazard) and Spetsmashiny JSC (the city solid waste land fill). Another private company, which is part of Pavlodar Chemical Plant JSC, is engaged in collection, employing the technology of Tolyatti IFC Chelnok JSC (). The enterprise has so far recycled more than 90,000 lamps. Experimental work has been conducted on \u2018demercurization\u2019 in the use of fluorescent lamps of Petropavlovsk by ZIKSTO JSC. In Almaty oblast the mercury-containing waste and fluorescent lamps are delivered for demercurization to the specialized enterprise Synap JSC (Almaty). A facility for the centralized collection, storage and recycling of utilized luminescent, mercury lamps and devices has been opened in Uralsk, western Kazakhstan.\nRecycling efforts are being made in West Kazakhstan also. For instance, Stroitekh JSC has begun to recycle broken glass and produce consumer goods from them. A similar project is being developed by Zheksengaly JSC. Uralvtorma Research and Production Association has designed a project on recycling wood-shavings, scrap paper, wool to produce composite building slabs used in the construction industry.\nIn order to resolve the problem of waste management, it is necessary to develop a National Waste Management Program, spelling out waste management policies, a legal framework and methodology for waste disposal, an economic mechanism for waste management and monitoring. Implementation of this program requires: an inventory of existing tailings and dumps and assessment of their technical condition; specification and analysis of flows, volumes and components of accumulated and buried waste; assessment of risks for decision-making.\n\nAlternative or renewable energy sources include hydro-electric power, wind power, marine wave action, solar radiation, geothermal energy, energy of biomass and biogas.\n has significant potential in renewable energy sources, but only a small part of this is being used. This is due to the fact that Kazakhstan's energy sector was developed as part of the centralized energy supply system of the huge and \u2018traditional\u2019 electricity production stations of the former Soviet Union. The development of local energy sources was not emphasized.\nThe issue of renewable energy development has been highlighted for different reasons. The vast territory of Kazakhstan, its low population density and concentration of generating capacity mainly in the northern part of the country, mean that energy must be transported over significant distances, resulting in losses of up to 30%. Therefore, the centralization of the energy supply of remote areas is economically inefficient and the development of small and alternative energy supplies has the potential to solve some of the existing problems, in particular:\nAccording to the survey \u201cKazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan - opportunities for the development of renewable energy sources\u201d executed within the framework of the Program of Technical Assistance ESMAP in 1997, about 5100 remote settlements in Kazakhstan are not connected to electricity transmission lines. Under these conditions the development of renewable energy sources to provide local energy is economically justified.\n possesses significant potential for , estimated at 170 billion kWh annually. The economic potential is 23.5 billion kWh and at present about 8 billion kWh are used annually. The development of small river potential in Kazakhstan is also quite promising. According to data of the Kazakhstan Institute \u201cHydroproject\u201d, more than 503 projects are available for construction of hydroelectric power stations on small rivers, with an overall capacity of 1380 Megawatts. Possible electric power production by these small river power plants has the potential to produce around 6.3 billion kWh annually. The State Program of \u201cElectro\u00acenergy development until 2030\u201d foresees construction of a number of hydroelectric power stations. The most promising projects are: Mainakskaya hydroelectric power station on the Charyn River, with a capacity of 300 Megawatts; and Kerbulakskaya hydroelectric power station on the Ili River, with a capacity of 50 Megawatts. Annual production of electric power by these river facilities may reach about 900 million kWh.\nDue to its location, much of  is in the \u2018wind belt\u2019 of the northern hemisphere and is extremely rich in wind resources and thus of . According to estimates, the density of the wind potential in Kazakhstan equals approximately 10 megawatts per square kilometer.\nA number of areas in the northern, central, and southeast regions of , and also in western Kazakhstan, have considerable wind potential. According to data from meteorological observation posts, the average wind speed in these regions exceeds 5\u00a0km/second and in some places reaches 6\u20137\u00a0km/second, making the use of wind potential a viable prospect. The Kazakhstan Institute, Kazselenergoproekt has surveyed at least 15 sites for the construction of large Wind Energy Stations (\u2018wind farms\u2019) that have the capacity to produce several hundred megawatts. According to the 2030 Energy Development Program, a 500-megawatt wind power station (WPS) is expected to be built in Kazakhstan. These wind farms have the potential to produce 1-1.5 billion kWh of energy annually.\nThe wind potential of the Dzungarian and Sheleksky corridor in Almatinsky Oblast, southeast Kazakhstan, has been extensively investigated. Within the framework of technical assistance to  under the UN Development Program on wind energy development, detailed wind measurements have been carried out in these two regions, revealing significant wind potential. The average annual wind speed in the Dzungarian Gates is 7.5\u00a0km/s, and in the Sheleksky corridor - 5.8\u00a0km/s at a height of 10 meters. With support from the UNDP/GEF, the first pilot wind-driven power plant is expected to be constructed, producing 5 megawatts, in the Dzungarian Gates. The company Almatyavtomatika is currently installing the first Kazakh wind power plant at Druzhba in the Dzungarian Gates, with a production capacity of 500\u00a0kW. Other low-capacity wind farms have also been installed in several settlements. There are a number of small wind energy installation projects in Akmolinsky Oblast benefiting from Dutch technical assistance.\nThere are also prospects for wind energy use to raise water from wells using wind pumps. In Soviet period such wind pumps were widely used in the territory of .\nIn spite of the fact that  is located northward between latitudes 42 and 55, the potential solar radiation is significant and may produce 1300-1800 kWh per square meter. Due to the continental climate the number of solar hours is about 2200-3000 per year, making  use possible.\nThe main area of solar energy use is the generation of hot water using solar collectors, or \u2018suntraps\u2019. According to estimates of local experts it is possible to generate about 13 million Gcal of heat for heating water supplies, allowing savings of more than 1 million tons of petroleum equivalent. The use of solar panels for heating water can be carried out both on boiler systems for a central heat supply and a heat supply for individual buildings. Now, with the support of UNDP and the Canadian Agency for International Development a pilot project is being carried out on the use of solar collectors in one boiler-house in Almaty.\nIn  there is great demand for solar collectors to heat water. However, they have not yet found wide application due to their high cost, at around 200-300 USD per 1 sq. meter. However it is possible to significantly decrease the cost and expand the scale of their application if the solar collectors can be produced locally.\nThe other area of potential solar power use is the generation of electricity with the help of photo\u00acelectric converters. Photo-electric panels can be used to generate electricity in small quantities for such needs as illumination, tele-radio broadcasting on small agricultural farms and shepherd camps. According to estimates from research conducted under the framework of ESMAP, application of small solar photo-electric panels with batteries can work out even more economical than the use of kerosene lamps for lighting. The possible market for 20-watt solar photo-electric panels in Kazakhstan should be about 20,000 units.\nThere are also opportunities for photo-electric panels\u2019 application to operate small electric pumps to raise water from underground wells. A combination of photo-electric panels and wind-driven power plants for water pumps is also possible and will increase the reliability of water-supply. With the UNDP framework it is planned to implement a pilot project on water supply in remote areas in the Aral region, using photo-electric panels and wind-driven power plants which will produce electricity for pumps and a desalinization plant for preparation of potable water. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, MEP, and the Ministry of Education and Science are jointly developing a Programme on \u201cEnergy Saving and Development of Alternative Sources of Energy\u201d.\n has a number of places with underground sources of hot water. However, their practical use is restricted since the temperature of water is generally below 55 degrees.\nAccording to the ESMAP research \u201cKazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan - opportunities for development of renewable energy sources\u201d only one underground source of hot water above 96\u00b0 has been found, close to Zharkent. This source can be used for heating needs.\n is the generation of gas from waste vegetation, waste products of animal husbandry, household waste products, deposits of sewage, etc. Calculations show that processing annual waste from agriculture for biogas generation can produce an energy volume equal to 14-15 million tons of fuel equivalent, or 10.32 million tons of petroleum.\nTACIS and UNDP Programs support the use of biogas by farmers and inhabitants of remote settlements as a means of preserving forest tracts, harnessing animal waste and preventing stream flow pollution. In a number of settlements installations for the generation of biogas from manure have been assembled. The experience shows that use of biogas installations producing 15 cubic meters of biogas per day (1 ton of manure for 4 months) ensures heating a building of 60 square meters and cooking meals for a family of 4-5 persons.\nThe frontline of the Caspian Sea can serve as a source of . According to meteorological data it may be highly profitability to use wave power stations. There are projects of a modular wave power station with a capacity up to 3 megawatts. At a wave height of 3\u20135 meters, annual electricity production can reach about 3 million kWh with a cost price per 1 kWh of around 3-4 USD cents.\nRealization of similar projects has the potential to supply oil-field settlements in the Caspian Sea area with independent energy sources and reduce current consumption of electricity from the national network by 50-85%.\n\nThe  plays a major role in the world community by preparing and implementing environmental protection plans for the  basin, demonstrated by leading international donor organizations (global, regional and bilateral) and executive agencies, such as the , , , WB, , , ,  and,  and by participating in different forms of technical assistance to CA states. The total amount of expected investment in the development and implementation of regional environmental programs and projects in the Aral Sea basin is in the range of 350-400 million USD. De facto disbursement of funds for resolving the environmental problems of the region does not exceed 10% of the intended finance. This depends mainly on the programs and project compliance with the national priorities and economic interests of the countries in the region, as well as on their activity in the co-financing of regional projects. As a result,  and  have an active agenda in the area of water management systems; , Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan in the area of mountain ecosystems;  and  have an active agenda in the area of biodiversity; and Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan in the area of combating desertification.\nThe principal financing for regional projects is divided according to the following priorities: environmental problem of the Aral Sea 76% of total funds; protected mountain territories 16%; combating desertification and  2%; and other targeted projects 6%. It is obvious that trans-boundary issues - air and surface water pollution, waste utilization, combating densification of soil exposed to erosion - are not sufficiently covered by the regional programs. The above components are therefore often covered by national projects.\nImplementation of the objectives specified (programs and projects) can only be achieved with close cooperation between environmental protection agencies of the CA countries during the development stage of a uniform regional environmental strategy.\nThe most significant initiatives of regional cooperation in Central Asia are as follows:\nThe governments of the CAR countries have still not developed coordinated methods on integrated management that would take into account economic, social, and environmental issues on a comprehensive approach basis. This is mainly predetermined by the regional nature of ecosystems, and a necessity to take joint measures in resolving transboundary and inter-sector issues.\nThe process of \u201cEnvironment for Europe\u201d, which started in 1991 with the adoption of the Program of Actions for Environment Protection, played a key role for the countries of the region in implementation of the negotiation process. The Region's participation was supported by resolutions of the conferences, which were held in Sofia (1995) and Aahus (1998). In particular, in Aahus, the decision was made by CAR countries to begin drafting a regional environmental action plan (REAP), which was widely supported. The process of NEAP was an important stage, which was launched in the majority of the region's countries. It allowed a shift from comprehensive and unrealistic programs to priority actions and extensive work with donors. At present, the countries of the region participate extensively in similar programs established for the NIS in 2002.\nThe Regional Environment Action Plan for Central Asia (REAP) has been developed with the assistance and under the guidance of the UNEP/UNDP. Its goal is to create a basis for future of regional cooperation and the integration of efforts for the region's countries, aimed at preservation of the environment and the populations\u2019 living conditions. A set of measures has been developed to resolve priority targets. The following key strategic targets related to environmental protection in the CAR countries have been identified for REAP:\nWater challenges (resource, freshness and scarcity) in  are the main issues that need to be addressed. Environmental, social, and economic implications in the Aral region have a major impact on watercourses and energy needs. Fluctuations in seasonal demand for water resources and their unbalanced distribution are the results of conflicting preconditions that significantly influence the economic conditions of all countries in the region.\nAn agreement between the countries on the status of the  and its adjacent territories, as independent water consumers, should help resolve the water challenges of the Aral basin and address the different countries\u2019 water needs. Therefore, establishing a legal framework at the regional level should be an important factor in resolving such water-related conflicts as:\nThe existing legal framework of water management should be determined by a set of policy documents (taking into account international water laws, as well as local traditions) which strictly regulate the parameters of cooperation in the area of water management and consumption. Establishment of a strong legal framework is a labor-intensive process, requiring involvement of highly skilled specialists, national experts and the general public.\nIn order to expand the issues identified for the Aral Sea basin, a number of regional programs and projects are being prepared with broad scope in the area of rational utilization of water resources and environmental protection:\nThe problems of transboundary water resource utilization are still of utmost importance in resolving regional issues between  and neighboring countries, such as the , , , and . The existing water supply is one of the main constraints to developing the rich mineral, fuel, energy, and land resources of the country.\nIn order to establish closer regional cooperation in transboundary water apportioning,  joined the \u00abConvention of Protection and Utilization of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes\u00bb on December 4, 2000.\nImprovement of interstate water relations should be viewed as a key issue in terms of national security, particularly in the southern regions of Kazakhstan. In spite of the extensive activities conducted by the IFAS (International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea) and its branches, the urgent nature of transboundary water resource distribution in CAR is constantly growing.\nThe key documents regulating the distribution of water resources in the basin of the Syrdarya River are:\nTaking into consideration the significant amount of transboundary watercourses passing over the territory of  and , on August 27, 1992 an interstate Agreement on Joint Utilization and Protection of Transboundary Water Facilities was signed in Orenburg. The Agreement regulates relations in the area of transboundary water facilities\u2019 protection and utilization. Based on the Agreement, a Kazakhstan-Russia Commission was established, which approves time schedules of common use of water reservoirs and distribution of water intake limits and develops measures to conduct repair and operation of water management utilities.\nTo resolve the issue of managing Transboundary Rivers with , three rounds of negotiations were conducted by experts, which resulted in the approval of the provision on a Joint Working Group of Experts for Transboundary Rivers between the two countries. At the first meeting (November 6, 2000 in Almaty) of the Joint Working Group of Experts, a preliminary list of trans-boundary rivers was agreed and a list of action measures was specified.\nUndoubtedly, an important stage in the preservation of mountain ecosystems, is a project which proposes the strategy of \u00abRegional Cooperation in the Area of Sustainable Development of Mountain Territories in Central Asia\u00bb (ABRD). Its key priority is facilitation and coordination of comprehensive research of mountain territories by monitoring.\nThe Bishkek Global Mountain Summit (BGMS) (Bishkek, October 29-November 1, 2002) became the principal outcome of the International Mountain Year, which attracted the international community's attention to the issues of mountain areas. The Bishkek Mountain Platform was adopted and a Central Asian Mountain Charter was signed. The Central Asian Mountain Charter was signed by the Ministers of Environmental Protection of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, containing the principles, goals and approaches on the management and utilization of mountain territories. It also contains an intention to draft a Central Asian Convention for the Preservation and Rational Utilization of Mountain Territories and the establishment of an International Negotiation Committee.\nWith support from the Asian Development Bank, the region's countries have developed a Central Asian Strategy for the Sustainable Development of Mountains. The Working Group set up, as well as the Regional Office in cooperation with the Regional Environmental Center (REC) of Central Asia, conduct activities to improve the adaptable Strategy for all countries of the region. The necessity has been justified to create the Regional Mountain Center (RMC), its activities aimed at resolving specific issues of mountain territories.\nIt worth noting that the intended and implemented projects in this area - Preservation of Biodiversity of the Western Tien Shan (GEF) and Preservation and Sustainable Utilization of Biodiversity of the Altai-Sayan Mountain Ecoregion (GEF) - cover only a minor part of the existing issues of mountain ecosystem preservation.\nA significant contribution to the well-being of the natural wealth are made by implemented, ongoing and planned national/regional projects for biodiversity preservation and expansion of protected territories. Activities in this sphere include:\n\nThe first municipal waste processing plant in Kazakhstan was opened in December 2007 in Almaty with support of local akimat. Vtorma-Ecology Plant covered 90% of the city's utilization of . At that time  accumulated about 600 tons of garbage per year. During 4.5\u20135 years, the company was to pay back $28 million investments and reach cost recovery by producing secondary materials -  flex, plastic pellets, paper, ferrous and non-ferrous metals. But to the economic crisis the price of recyclables has fallen in 1,5-3 times, and the plant was not able to cover its costs and pay the loan, issued by \"KazKom Bank\". In October 2010 the plant was mothballed, criminal case of non-payment the wages was opened on Rustem Parmanbekov, director of the plant, and environmental prosecutor's office estimated the environmental damage in the amount of 7 million tenge.\nIn September 2012 Agency for Construction, Housing and Utilities of RK has presented the Program of construction of 41 waste processing plants around Kazakhstan within 10\u201315 years. Particularly, the Agency plans to open 10 plants until 2015.\nAs the Agency informs, the pilot projects will be launched in Aktobe, Atyrau, Karaganda, Abai, Saran, Shakhtinsk, Kostanay, Pavlodar, Taldykorgan, Taraz, Ust-Kamenogorsk, Kokshetau, etc.\nThese efforts will allow developing specific mechanisms of solid waste management in Kazakhstan and providing investors with one more sphere for investments.\nFirst of the objects within the Program is Astana Waste Processing Plant, which was planned to open in October 2012 and cover all city needs in MSW utilization, with its productivity of 400,000 tons per year. The opening ceremony was held on December 24, 2012. This is the second waste processing plant in Kazakhstan after Almaty plant. The Astana plant was built on basis of Spanish technology.\nAs regards to Almaty Plant, which is still not operating, the Agency claims that owners have to deal with their economic problems themselves.\nThe Program also covers , which has a dramatic situation with spontaneously growing dump close to residential areas of the city. For residents of these neighborhoods proximity to the dump has turned into serious health problems. Due to constant acrid smoke and smell of burning people get such diseases as asthma, bronchitis etc.\nThe plant in  was planned to be built in 2007: \"Construction is scheduled to start next spring and finish by fall,\" - declared the subcontractor in January 2007. But the choice of the landfill and other issues took more time than planned.\nOnly in December 2009 an investment agreement with Shymkent Akimat was signed and area for polygon and plant was defined.

Until the end of the year builders acquired approximately 20 million tenge.\nBut in April 2012, Akimat refused to continue funding the project. For the moment the project is still frozen.

An important route taken by cattle ranchers and their cattle is the .\nDeforestation has been a significant source of pollution, , and  worldwide, but deforestation has been Brazil's foremost cause of environmental and ecological degradation. Since 1970, over 600,000 square kilometers of Amazonian rainforest have been destroyed and the level of deforestation in the protected zones of Brazil's Amazon rainforest increased by over 127 percent between 2000 and 2010. Recently, further destruction of the  has been promoted by an increased global demand for Brazilian wood, meat, and soybeans. Also, as of 2019, some environmental laws have been weakened and there has been a cut in funding and personnel at key government agencies and a firing of the heads of the agency\u2019s state bodies.\nAround 150 hydroelectric dams are planned to be constructed in the Amazon basin (of which a large part is situated in Brazil). This could be  if they would require inundating part of the lowland rainforest.\nBrazil is home to over 6% of the world's . According to a species assessment conducted by the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species, 97 species have been identified in Brazil with vulnerable, lower risk/near threatened, endangered, or critically endangered standing. In 2009, 769 endangered species were identified in Brazil making it home to the eighth largest number of endangered species in the world. Much of this increase in Brazil, as well as the countries it precedes, is caused by rapid deforestation and industrialization. This has been noted by , Brazil's Environment Minister, who states that as protected areas are populated by humans, preservation areas are lacking the essential protection they need. Changing environmental factors are largely responsible for the increase in the number of endangered species. Taking into account the large effects that deforestation and industrialization have had, it becomes clear that by increasing regulation and policy these detrimental effects can be reversed.\nBrazil's population has a stable growth rate at 0.83% (2012), unlike China or India which are experiencing a rapid urban growth. With a steady growth rate, the challenge for  in Brazil is in regard to provision of adequate financing and government funding. While funding is inadequate, lawmakers and municipal authorities are taking steps to improve their individual cities' waste management systems. These individual efforts by city officials are made in response to the lack of an all-encompassing law that manages the entire country's waste materials. Even though there are collection services, they tend to focus in the south and southeast of Brazil. However, Brazil does regulate dangerous waste materials such as oil, tires and pesticides.\nIn 2014, Brazil hosted the FIFA World Cup. As a result, a great amount of investment entered the country, yet waste management improvements still lack funds. In order to address the lack of federal involvement, the public and private sectors, as well as formal and informal markets, are developing potential solutions to these problems. International organizations as well are teaming up with local city officials such as in the case of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). Since 2008, the UNEP has been working with Brazil to create a sustainable waste management system that promotes environmental preservation and conservation along with the protection of public health. This partnership is between the UNEP and city officials who form the Green and Healthy Environments Project in . With community involvement, the project is able to promote policies that establish environmental change. According to a UNEP report, the project has already gathered research on sanitation in Brazil. \nWith the various partnerships and collaborations, certain cities are making strides in efficiently managing their waste, but a more comprehensive and conclusive decision must be made for the entire country to create a more sustainable future.\nCurrently, collection services are more prominent in the south and southeast regions of Brazil. Various methods are used to separate waste materials, such as paper, metal and glass. According to Integrated Municipal Solid Waste Management, solid waste in Brazil is composed of 65% organic matter, 25% paper, 4% metal, 3% glass, and 3% plastic. Within 405 municipalities, 7% of the country's total municipalities, 50% of the separation of these materials is conducted through door-to-door service, 26% through collection points, and 43% through informal street waste pickers. A major victory for waste collection was between 2006 and 2008 when the country's waste collection services expanded to service an additional one million people, bringing the rate of separated waste collection among the country's population to 14%.\nWhile waste collection in Brazil is improving slightly, the ultimate disposal of waste commonly takes place in inadequate landfills. While landfills are often viewed as the last option for waste disposal in European nations, preferring  systems instead, Brazil favors landfills and believes they are efficient modes of disposal. The preference for landfills has hindered the creation of alternative methods of waste disposal. Often, this hesitation is in response to the initial costs of adopting new solutions. For example, incinerators are expensive to purchase, operate and maintain, eliminating them as an option for most cities in Brazil. According to the Integrated Municipal Solid Waste Management Manual, landfill usage will begin to fall due to new regulation and laws. As the risks and environmental hazards of open air landfills are understood by municipality administrators in Brazil, more dumps are being closed in favor of sanitary landfills. However, these policy changes will only happen with appropriate financing.\n is one way to dispose of all combustible waste in which recycling alone is not economically viable. As income levels rise in the southern region of Brazil, citizens are urging officials to improve waste management systems. However, the results are limited as no commercial facilities are currently being constructed. Even though citizens and officials are beginning to understand the harm of landfills and the importance of waste management, most do not understand waste-to-energy systems. On the other hand, waste-to-energy industry leaders do not understand the current waste condition in Brazil. \nIn order to provide specific solutions to problems in Brazil, the Waste to Energy Research Technology Counsel in Brazil is developing a hybrid  (MSW)/natural gas cycle. This system burns a small amount of natural gas that is 45% efficient and 80% of the energy that is produced by MSW is 34% efficient. Their patented system takes a small gas turbine and mixes it with preheated air. Another benefit of using low amounts of natural gas is the possibility of replacing it with , ethanol, or renewable fuels. Another benefit is that this system does not change current incinerator technology, which allows it to use components that already exist in other waste-to-energy plants. \nPrivate sector involvement in the waste-to-energy industry includes companies such as Siemens, , Keppel-Seghers, , Sener, P\u00f6yry, Fisia-Babcock, Malcolm Pirnie and others who are already established in Brazil and developing waste-to-energy projects. Some cities currently considering such projects are , , S\u00e3o Paulo, ,  and others.\nClean development mechanism projects are also beginning to develop at some Brazilian landfills. These projects are established to collect gases produced on-site and convert them into energy. For example, at a landfill in Nova Igua\u00e7u (Rio de Janeiro area), methane is being collected and converted into electricity. This process is expected to eliminate 2.5 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions by 2012.\nAccording to data from the Brazilian Association of Public Cleaning and Special Waste Companies including sewage, Brazil is a leader in aluminum can recycling without government intervention with ten cans being recycled every year. In 2007, more than 96% of cans available in the market were recycled. This leadership comes from informal waste scavengers that make their living by collecting aluminum cans. However, recycling in general in Brazil is low. Brazil produces 240 thousand tons of waste every day. Out of this amount, only 2% is recycled with the remainder dumped in landfills. \nIn 1992, private companies in Brazil established the Brazilian Business Commitment for Recycling (CEMPRE), a nonprofit organization that promotes recycling and waste elimination. The organization issues publications, conducts technical research, holds seminars and maintains databases. Nevertheless, only 62% of the population has access to the garbage collection. Even within these collection systems, the collection of recyclable material is not common. \nThe success of informal waste pickers provided evidence to lawmakers and citizens that solutions that are low tech, low cost, and labor-intensive can provide sustainable solutions to waste management while also providing social and economic benefits.\nBrazil is the second-largest producer of ethanol in the world. Ethanol production in Brazil uses sugarcane as feedstock and relies on  based on the use of the sucrose content of sugarcane. First-generation biofuels\nDue to its unique position as the only area of the world which extensively utilizes ethanol, air quality issues in Brazil relate more to ethanol-derived emissions. With about 40% of fuel used in Brazilian vehicles sourced from ethanol,  in Brazil differs from that of other nations where predominately petroleum or natural gas-based fuels are used. Atmospheric concentrations of acetaldehyde, ethanol and possibly nitrogen oxides are greater in Brazil than most other areas of the world due to their emissions being higher in vehicles using ethanol fuels. The larger urban areas of S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Brasilia suffer from substantial ozone issues because both acetaldehyde and nitrogen oxides are significant contributors to photochemical air pollution and ozone formation. On the other hand, by the mid-1990s, lead levels in the air had decreased by approximately 70% after the widespread introduction of unleaded fuels in Brazil in 1975.\nNumbers of automobiles and levels of industrialization in Brazilian cities highly influence levels of air pollution in urban areas which have an important impact on health for large population groups in major Brazilian urban areas. Based on annual air pollution data gathered in the cities of Belo Horizonte, , , Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paulo, and  between the years of 1998 and 2005, 5% of total annual deaths in the age groups of children age five and younger and adults age 65 and older were attributed to air pollution levels in these cities. Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo were ranked the 12th and 17th most polluted cities in an evaluation based on World Bank and United Nations data of emissions and air quality in 18 mega-cities. The multi-pollutant index used to perform the evaluation did not include any of the pollutants specific to the air quality impacts of ethanol fuel use.\nThe city of , designated by the Brazilian government as an industrial zone due in part to its proximity to the , became known as the \"Valley of Death\" and \"the most polluted place on Earth\". The area has historically housed numerous industrial facilities including an oil refinery from  and a steel mill from . Operation of such facilities was done so \"without any environmental control whatsoever\" prompting tragic events throughout the 1970s and 1980s including mudslides and birth defects potentially attributable to heavy pollution in the region. Since that time, efforts have been made to improve environmental conditions in the area including, since 1993, COSIPA's $200 million investment in environmental controls. In 2000, Cubat\u00e3o's center registered 48 micrograms of particles per cubic meter of air, down from 1984 measurements registering 100 micrograms of particles per cubic meter.\nLikely due to trade liberalization, Brazil has a high concentration of pollution-intensive export industries. Studies point to this as evidence of Brazil being a . The highest of levels of pollution intensity are found in export-related industries such as metallurgy, paper and cellulose, and footwear.\n\u2019s major and medium size metropolitan areas face increasing problems of . Coastal cities such as  and  suffer effects of upstream residential and industrial sewage contaminating feeder rivers, lakes, and the ocean. In 2000, only 35% of collected wastewater received any treatment.\nFor example, the , which runs through the S\u00e3o Paulo metropolitan area (17 million inhabitants), has returned to its 1990 pollution levels. Despite the support from the , the  and  in a US$400 million cleanup effort, the level of  has returned to the critical level of 1990 at 9 mg per liter due to increased levels of unregulated sewerage, phosphorus, and ammonia nitrogen discharged into the river. As of 2007, the state water company  projects that a minimum of R$3 billion (US$1.7bn) would be necessary to clean up the river.\nThe South and Southeast regions of Brazil experience  due to  and misuse of surface , mostly attributable to heavy pollution from , leaking , and .\nAccording to an investigation by Unearthed, more than 1,200 pesticides and weedkillers, including 193 containing chemicals banned in the EU, have been registered in Brazil between 2016 and 2019.\nWater pollution is also derived from ethanol production. Due to the size of the industry, its  activity in growing, harvesting, and processing  generates water pollution from the application of  and , , cane washing, fermentation, distillation, the energy producing units installed in mills and by other minor sources of waste water.\nThe two greatest sources of water pollution from ethanol production come from mills in the form of waste water from washing sugarcane stems prior to passing through mills, and , produced in distillation. These sources increase the biochemical oxygen demand in the waters where they are discharged which leads to the depletion of dissolved oxygen in the water and often causes . Legislation has banned the direct discharge of vinasse onto surface waters, leading it to be mixed with waste water from the sugarcane washing process to be reused as organic fertilizer on sugarcane fields. Despite this ban, some small sugarcane mills still discharge vinasse into streams and rivers due to a lack of transportation and application resources. Furthermore, vinasse is sometimes mishandled in storage and transport in mills.\n has had  as well as other forms of pollution.\nThe  has for over twenty years been afflicted with heavy pollution from sewage, primarily from S\u00e3o Paulo, and manufacturing. In 1992, the  was initiated in an effort to clean up the river. S\u00e3o Paulo today processes 55% of its sewage and is expected to process 85% by 2018.\nBrazil has a generally advanced and comprehensive legislation on environmental protection and sustainability. Laws regarding forests, water, and wildlife have been in effect since the 1930s. Until the mid-1990s, environmental legislation addressed isolated environmental issues; however, the legal framework has been improved through new policy-making that targets environmental issues within the context of an integrated environmental policy.</ref></ref> The Brazilian government strives toward the preservation and  of Brazilian biomes. Consequently, the Brazilian government developed strategies to impose specific policies for each  and organize opportunities for social participation, institutional reform of the forestry sector, and expansion of the biodiversity concept. For example, the program Legal Earth, developed by the Ministries of Agrarian Development and Environment, has the responsibility to regulate the use of public lands occupied in the Amazon region. This program was successful in restricting the marketing of meat produced on illegally deforested areas and the proper identification of permitted areas for growing sugarcane for the production of ethanol.\nBrazil recognized that it was part of the solution to the problem of . In 2010, Brazil took the necessary steps to advance its climate change commitments made at the COP-15 in . For example, the policy to combat deforestation in the  in had produced positive results, as demonstrated by announcements of increasingly lower deforestation rates. \n\nBetween 2000 and 2010, the deforestation took huge proportions. Then, in 2011, data from the  showed a decrease in deforestation rates in the Amazon Rainforest. This is in part due to an increased awareness of the damaging effects of prolific logging practices and a shift toward sustainable forestry in Brazil.   Although forestry companies\u2014many of which are based outside of Brazil\u2014are interested in increasing their longevity, the Brazilian government has been actively promoting more sustainable forestry policies for years. Brazil's National Institute for Space Research (INPE) has helped reduce deforestation levels over the course of 2011 through its Real Time Deforestation Detection System (). Besides DETER, INPE also has the Amazon Deforestation Satellite Monitoring Project (). Furthermore, Brazil has negotiated to use satellites from India to improve the monitoring of deforestation in the Amazon rain forest. In addition, the Government took measures to more effectively enforce its deforestation reduction policy through shutting down illegal sawmills and seizing illegal timber and vehicles. Brazilian officials and environmental advocates alike were confident that these measures would enhance the Brazilian government's ability to combat deforestation, biodiversity loss, and pollution.\nData from 2010 showed that Brazil has reduced  by more than 70%, the lowest deforestation rate in over 20 years. At this rate, Brazil's goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 38.9% was to be reached by 2016 rather than 2020.\nBetween 2010 and 2018,  have indeed been low, but data suggests that (in the Amazon region), since 2019, the deforestation rate is again rising considerably.\nDespite all those efforts, however, the problem with deforestation and  has remained a very serious issue in the country.\nThe Ministry of Environment is responsible for Brazil's national environmental policy. The ministry's many departments deal with climate change and environmental quality, biodiversity and forests, water resources, sustainable urban and rural development, and environmental citizenship. Other authorities are also responsible for the implementation of environmental policies, including the National Council on the Environment, the National Council of the Amazon, the National Council of Water Resources, the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBIO), Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA), Board of Management of Public Forests, and others. The collaborative work of these institutions makes it possible to ensure sustainable growth within the means of the environment.\nThe development of institutions at the governmental level was stimulated and accompanied by the diffusion and increasing importance of NGOs dedicated to environmental causes and sustainable development. Numerous NGOs throughout Brazil produce documents containing both useful information and criticisms.\nAs part of Brazil's environmental initiatives, it is party to the following international agreements: Antarctic-Environmental Protocol, Antarctic-Marine Living Resources, Antarctic Seals, Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change, , Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands, Whaling, , ...\n"},

The large volume handled by health care professionals on a daily basis increases the chance that an injury may occur.\nThe general public can occasionally be at risk of sustaining injuries from sharps waste as well when hypodermic needles are improperly disposed of by injection drug users.\nA  is a hard  that is used to safely dispose of  and other sharp medical instruments, such as  catheters and disposable scalpels. They are often sealable and self-locking, as well as rigid, which prevents waste from penetrating or damaging the sides of the container. In the United States, sharps containers are usually red and marked with the universal biohazard symbol for ease of recognition. Elsewhere, they are often yellow. Waste is loaded into the container until it reaches a certain height, which is usually around three-quarters of the way full. At that point, the container is emptied or disposed of.\nSharps containers may be single use, in which case they are disposed of along with the waste they contain, or reusable, in which case they are robotically emptied and sterilized before being returned for re-use. Airports and large institutions commonly have sharps containers available in restrooms for safe disposal for users of injection drugs, such as insulin-dependent . Medical facilities and laboratories are also equipped with sharps containers, as well as the equipment required to safely sterilize or dispose of them. This minimizes the distance the containers have to travel and the number of people to come in contact with the sharps waste. Smaller clinics or offices in the US without such facilities are required by federal regulations to hire the services of a company that specializes in transporting and properly disposing of the hazardous wastes.\nExtreme care must be taken in the  and disposal of sharps waste. The goal in sharps waste management is to safely handle all materials until they can be properly disposed of. The final step in the disposal of sharps waste is to dispose of them in an . A less common approach is to  them; typically only  sharps waste is incinerated. Steps must be taken along the way to minimize the risk of injury from this material, while maximizing the amount of sharps material disposed. Strict  protocols and government regulations that instruct health care providers on how to manage sharps waste help ensure that the waste is handled as effectively and safely as possible.\nDisposal methods vary by country and locale, but common methods of disposal are either by truck service or, in the , by disposal of sharps through the mail. Truck service involves trained personnel collecting sharps waste, and often , at the point of generation, and hauling it away by truck to a destruction facility. Similarly, the mail-back sharps disposal method allows generators to ship sharps waste to the disposal facility directly through the  in specially designed and approved shipping containers. Mail-back sharps disposal allows waste generators to dispose of smaller amounts of sharps more economically than if they were to hire out a truck service. Recent legislation in  has stated that pharmaceutical companies supplying self injection medications are responsible for the disposal of spent needles. Previously popular needle clippers and caps are no longer acceptable as safety devices, and either sharps box or needle destruction devices are required.\nWith more than sixteen billion injections administered annually worldwide, needles are the largest contributor to sharps waste. For this reason, many new technologies surrounding injections have been developed, mostly related to safety mechanisms. As these technologies have been developed, governments have attempted to make them commonplace to ensure sharps waste safety. In 2000, the  was passed, along with the 2001 .\n help reduce occurrences of accidental needlesticks. One of the most recent developments has been the auto-disable injection device. These injection devices automatically disable after a single use. This can be done by retracting the needle back into the syringe or rendering the syringe plunger inoperable. With the injection device now inoperable, it cannot be reused. Shielding the needle after the injection is another approach for safe management of sharps. These are hands free methods usually involving a hinging cap that can be pressed on a table to seal the needle. Another technology in sharps waste management relating to injections is the . Varying approaches can be taken with the main goal to separate the needle from the syringe. This allows the sharp needle to be quarantined and disposed of separately from the syringe. There is debate around the use of these devices, as they involve in additional step in the handling of sharps waste.\nSharps waste is of great concern in  and transitional regions of the world. Factors such as high disease prevalence and lack of health care professionals amplify the dangers involved with sharps waste, and the cost of newer disposal technology makes them unlikely to be used. \nAs with the rest of the world, injection wastes make up the largest portion of sharps waste. However, injection use is much more prevalent in this world segment. One of the contributors to this increase is a larger emphasis placed on injections for therapeutic purposes.  It has been estimated that 95% of all injections in developing regions are for therapeutic purposes. The average person has been estimated to receive up to 8.5 injections per year. Newly developed injection technologies are rarely used to provide these injections due to added costs. Therefore, the majority of injections are given with standard disposable syringes in developing regions.\nThe infrastructure of developing regions is not equipped to deal with this large volume of contaminated sharps waste.  Contrary to the industrialized world, disposal incinerators and transportation networks are not always available.  Cost restraints make the purchase of single use disposable containers unrealistic. Facilities are often overwhelmed with patients and understaffed with educated workers. Demand on these facilities can limit the emphasis or enforcement of waste disposal protocols. These factors leave a dangerous quantity of sharps waste in the environment. Contrasts between the industrialized and developing world segment can be seen in accidental needle stick injuries. These occur at a rate of .18 to .74 per person per year in industrialized nations and .93 to 4.68 per person per year in developing and transitional nations (Hutin, Hauri, Armstrong, 2003).\nImproper sharps management is a major factor involved in what is categorized as unsafe injections. Annually these account for 21 million, 2 million, and 260,000 of new HBV, HCV, and HIV infections annually. 40-65% of new HBV and HCV are due to  occupational exposure.\n"},

No waste sorting, recycling, or reuse takes place at any of them. Instead, garbage is dumped into a working area and then flattened using a bulldozer to create a layer of garbage 300 centimetres (120\u00a0in) thick.\nThe Nubarashen landfill, located near  (), is Armenia's largest waste disposal site. It receives almost all of the solid waste produced in the city of Yerevan and its suburbs, which is about 340 tons per day, or 102,000 tons per year.

According to , Turkey's waste collection coverage rate is 77%, whereas its unsound waste disposal rate is 69%. While the country has a strong legal framework in terms of laying down common provisions for waste management, the implementation process has been considered slow since the beginning of 1990s.\nTurkey's waste management system is not a priority policy area. The country regardless employs several waste management practices including ,  (only for hazardous waste), sterilization, , and other advanced disposal methods such as ,  as well as . The most common method of waste disposal in the country, especially for municipal waste, is landfilling. The municipal waste is collected on a regularly scheduled basis. The metropolitan municipality and other municipalities are responsible for providing collection, transportation, separation, recycling, disposal and storage of waste services.\nTurkey uses a diffuse approach to manage waste by distributing duties and powers among many institutions and organizations.\nWaste management in Turkey is subject to numerous environmental laws. The country had only three laws concerning waste between 1983-2003, whereas ten more regulations were introduced between 2003-2008. Most environmental regulations in Turkey are based on Article 56 of the Constitution, which states:\nIt is the duty of the State and citizens to improve the natural environment, to protect the environmental health and to prevent environmental pollution.Turkish Law on Environment no.2872 creates the basis of the legal framework for waste management practices in Turkey:\nIt is prohibited to discharge all sorts of waste and residue directly or indirectly into receiving environment, storing them or being engaged in a similar activity.In addition, Law on Amendments in Law on Environment no.5491 (Article 11); Law on Metropolitan Municipalities no.5216 (Article 7); and Municipal Law no.5393 (Article 14 and 15) explain the duties of municipal authorities, whereas Law on Municipal Revenues no. 2464 (Article 97) establishes the . Finally, Articles 181 and 182 of the Turkish Penal Code no.5237 (under the section \"Crimes Against the Environment\") state that intentional pollution of the environment is punishable by law up to five years in prison. The degree of the punishment is decided upon the severity of the pollution and impact on the environment.\nAccording to the Turkish Ministry of Environment and Urbanization, the management of municipal waste is under the responsibility of municipalities as a regional management approach by the Ministry of Environment and Urbanization. Since 2003, municipalities are implementing municipal waste management projects by cooperating with other municipalities in the region (through the municipalities union). Turkish government drew up a master plan for 2007- 2009 based on the recognition that uncontrolled and unsafe waste disposal is an integral part of daily life in Turkey and poses a serious risk to the environment and to the health of the country's 70 million inhabitants. The number of controlled landfill sites was raised to roughly 3000 - a steep increase on the 90 that existed in the 1990s. As of 2011, there is approximately one sanitary landfill site per municipality.\nOngoing initiatives towards improving the municipal solid waste management in Turkey aimed to set up a waste management system acting in accordance with the related national legislation and EU legislation, covering the establishment of necessary waste treatment facilities (pretreatment facilities and landfills) and transfer stations, reduction of the amount of waste,ensuring recycling and reuse, and reducing the waste transportation costs.\nThe main question in the field of waste management is not the legal arrangement itself; but the deficiencies in implementing them. While Turkey uses a diffuse approach to manage its waste, the effectiveness of application process has been negatively affected due to repetitions and gaps in sharing roles and responsibilities among different agencies. This situation, coupled with insufficient institutional capacity and weak technical infrastructure, limits the ability of related legislation to direct the implementation. Turkey is also yet to develop a comprehensive and specific national strategic plan on waste management, or on the climate change overall.\n reported that waste was Turkey's largest source of  with 58% between 1990-2011.  data indicates that Turkey did not recycle any of its  between 2001-2010, although poor reporting, not performance, was given as the cause for the absence of data.  reports the total amount of recycled  in 2009 to be 2.5 million tonnes, and certainly part of this recycled packaging waste is from  sources, but the share is unknown. Out of the approximate 30 million tonnes of municipal waste generated in 2010, 25 million tonnes or 84% were collected and about 98% of this collected waste was landfilled either in sanitary landfills (54%) or dumpsites (44%).\nAs of 2013, Turkey imposes no . According to ,  will be carried out by 2025. In addition, the ministry gave no specific  reduction targets in its \"Climate Change Action Plan 2011-2023\" published in 2012. In the absence of binding international agreements, Turkey is still far from making sound commitments to combat  on both national and international level.\nThe biggest problem in terms of waste management in the country stems from uncovered , where the garbage is simply left to rot. In 2009, Turkey's overall greenhouse gas emissions increased about 98% compared to 1990 levels.  data shows that the country's  emissions increased by 52% between 1990-2011. According to this data,  emissions related to waste alone increased by 120% during the mentioned time period. This downward trend, coupled with the country's positive economic and demographic growth since 1990s, creates numerous problems.\nTurkey's waste financing system does not take into take into consider the  sufficiently, so economical tools are weak to deter pollution and financial sources are inadequate for investments. Usage of natural areas (forests, seasides etc.) still causes a great threat to the environment. In addition, insufficient capacity for treatment and disposal of hazardous waste leads to illegal dumping to the nature. Furthermore, recycling rates are poor due to the lack of adequate facilities and incentives in the waste sector. Uncovered  remain to be potential sources of flammable biogases, carcinogen and toxic waste, as well as microbial diseases due to the inadequate changes on their status since 1990s. Along with poor funding and reporting, recycling sector in Turkey also suffers from poor environmental consciousness on both public and industrial level.\n"},

It is currently regulated at both federal and state level. The Commonwealth's  is responsible for the national legislative framework.\nThe waste management has different effects and applications depending on the geographical, demographic and behavioural dynamics which it relates to. A number of reports and campaigns have been promoted.\nThe system is undergoing a process. of reformation in order to establish a more consistent and -based legislation, a more reliable database and a stronger, more independent domestic industry. These factors have hampered the development of the industry and interstate relations.\nAboriginal  are arrangements of bones, shells, ashes and other waste materials, usually related to meal consumption.  Most of them are considered as relics of cultural and archaeological relevance. Size can vary and they can occupy entire coastlines for hundreds of metres. Middens have been described as the first forms of dumping sites in Australia.  Seashells became an important source of lime in the 1800s and so middens, for example in the Sutherland Shire area, may have been mined for shells.\nDifferences with western-like disposal areas derive from the middens' purpose. Australian Indigenous people possess a culture which relates to land, sea and resources in a holistic way. As such, middens were used to organise resources and were not intended to, and did not, damage the landscape.\nMost Aborigines conducted a nomadic way of life, and because they were those who moved, and not their \"refuses\", some of these sites had originated from continuous human presence over hundreds or thousands of years.\nThe low density population, its  and the traits of the  led to a harmonised system in which waste was not contemplated as, and did not represent, an issue.\n became the place of the first permanent, European settlement in Australia on .  In accordance with a study, that is also considered the date in which the country's waste disposal system started to represent a problem.\nThe period spanning from 1788 to 1850 was characterised by an  mentality towards garbage and waste. The concept was supported by the idea that the , and in particularly its vastness, would have allowed for an  infinite time the exploitation of its areas as dumping sites. In most of the cases, residents were asked to independently dispose of their own waste (which was mostly organic) and the general lack of regulations resulted in very low hygienic conditions. These ultimately led to soil and water contamination, conditions that had consequences during the urban expansion in later years.\nThe initial absence of an industry that could have provided enough resources and materials for the colonies forced high rates of recycling. Household and other early forms of waste that could not be recycled or otherwise reused were left in the streets, dumped in rivers, or collected in the backyard, where acid was used to accelerate decomposition and diminish the smell.\nDiaries and journals from travellers and residents in the first decades of Sydney's life reported a \"shameful situation\", which saw what at that time was a town of 50,000 people covered by various types of waste, flies and mosquitoes.  was the major dumping site. Getting rid of waste in the sea (sea waste burial) was also a common practice, and beaches were often covered by residuals brought by tides.\nThe , one of the original Sydney local communities, used to collect freshwater in a river prior the European colonisation. At the time of  looking for the ideal settlement site, in 1788, a primary requirement was that of a sufficient freshwater supply, and that river constituted a crucial discriminant in the choice of Sydney. After the arrival of the colonists, the stream has been reported to have become so polluted that it was ordered to be covered with sandstone. The \"\", as it is now known, still flows beneath Sydney.\nDr , \u00a0with his publication \"Treatise on Fever\" (1830), catalysed the reforms of the British health system, but these did not promptly affect the Australian administrations. In the colony, proper hygienic practices -including waste management-, only started in the late years of the 19th century. This shift was partly due to the change in the administration nature of the colonies, which prior to that moment had limited the participation of the public in their affairs. Eventually, a more democratic and representative system was put into effect.\nThe waste classification system prior to federation in 1901 was not formalised and most refuse was directed to landfills or left in the streets. Exceptions were due to waste sea burials and to limited incineration practices, and required sorting in two additional streams characterised by flammable or sinkable waste. Recycling rates reduced, with only the low income classes inclined in pursuing these practices.\n was considered the world's dirtiest city in the . Its water and waste management systems were not able to keep up with the booming in population that followed the , hence the nickname \"Smellbourne\". Its hygienic conditions were described as \"fearful\" in 1847 by the Council's Sanitary Committee, which also stated the necessity of building new infrastructures in order to lessen epidemic risks. Infections and diseases rates were high, compared to those from other world cities like London.  and  were not rare and by the 1870s the city serious hygienic issues, reaching high infant mortality rates.\nThe  proposed to design a board of works in 1888, which was eventually established in 1890 under the name of  (MMBW). The scheme that would have reformed the usage (at that time comprehensive of both freshwater supply and sewerage disposal) of Melbourne's  waters was launched during the depression which hit the city during the 1890s. The initial debt and difficulties did not stop its creation, and the building processes started in 1892.\nBy the end of the century, most  in Australia flowed underground and sewerage systems were integrated in the urban complexes. Professions like  and  were fully established and supported recycling and a minimum control over the diffusion of rats.\nThe councils' political asset renovation of the 19th century contributed only in part to the development of a systematic legislation. The major changes in waste management were driven by the widespread of diseases and epidemics, especially that of the  which affected Sydney at the beginning of the 20th century. The newly gained awareness towards public health allowed urban reorganisation and advances in sanitary standards.\nIn 1901 Australia gained the independence from the . The lack of a centralised power which the states were exposed to limited the influence that the federation exerted on them. The executive role was exercised locally, by the councils.\n were the primary disposal sites. Incinerators were starting to be adopted as a result of the additional commercial value promoted by technological implementations. Their expensive nature previously led the Sydney council to decline the installation of one of such a plant, in 1889, but the plague which later spread in the area had the effect to reform priorities and justify the expenses.\nThe first decade of the century saw a rising demand of incinerators. A second accretion in the sector had place in the 1920s and it was largely due to the production of an Australian model, the Reverberatory Refuse Incinerator. In the same decade, the recycling of paper started in Melbourne.\n, technological advances and the clean air debate from overseas eventually imposed back landfill disposal over waste burning. During the Second World War the resources demand necessitated a strong recycling strategy, but by the end of the conflict priorities changed and recycling was discarded in favour of landfill disposal. Landfills also benefited from the technological advances acquired from the United States, and more sophisticated plants were build.\n and industrial waste were not known, or either ignored threats, and all wastes formed a general, unique  that would have eventually ended up in landfill. Since the  the industrial refuses received different attention and their disposal requirements improved. , the contaminated liquid which percolates through landfill material, was not prevented and this resulted in cases of environmental damages.\nThe population growth factor  in 1871 was 27% in Sydney, 26% in Melbourne and 23% in Adelaide. They reached 56%, 65% and 79% respectively in 1961. The New South Wales capital counted more than 2,000,000 residents; Melbourne was close, having 1,911,000 inhabitants, and Adelaide 587,000. The  boosted land reclamation, and landfill siting began to be more challenging.\nChemical and hazardous traits of waste began to be internalised in the disposal method evaluations since the , along with an augmented influence and regularisation by the Commonwealth. Standard landfills started not to accept certain types of waste, but  these measures did not take into account the escalation of illegal practices which arose as a response (such as clandestine dumping).\nThe  reached a 30% recycling rate.  for drink containers were shut down a decade later, in the 1970s, following the implementation of the recycling industry for bottles.\nPublic interest towards recycling and environmental protection arose greatly, yet the process of collecting recyclables was finite to specific geographic areas.

More people started to recognise the issues related to litter and to the waste management practices, and the government evaluated the return of the deposit refund and the taxation of non recyclable products. These were ultimately not implemented, except for .\nThe inappropriateness of the waste management strategies started to be evident in the last decade of the 20th century, with the cities undergoing a process of rapid population growth and the states being unable to contrast unregulated landfills.\nLandfill was still the preferred disposal method, although incinerators and recycling proposal began to be pondered again as alternatives. Paper and glass differentiated collection were not rare.\nThe adoption of waste levies, recyclables sales and the agreements with various industry sectors allowed the creation of new means of introit. The main constraints were represented by the residents, with the majority not sensitised in the matter.\nThe federal government gives ample autonomy to the single states, resulting in a miscellanea of laws, independent projects and objectives produced by each state still characterising the current waste management system. However, the Commonwealth has increasingly issued frameworks and policies with the aim of rendering the national waste management more consistent.\nAustralia is currently considered to be one of the greatest consumers of carbon and resources within the countries that relate to the . More advances, including in waste management, are needed in order to comply with the .\nThe national waste management framework is under implementation in order to establish a more consistent and circular-economy-based legislation, a more reliable database and a stronger, more independent domestic industry.\nThe waste management industry is currently worth about AUD$12.6 billion and contributes to the national economy with AUD$6.9 billion per annum.\nThe final objective of classifying waste is that of preserving the healthiness of both humans and environment by appropriately defining its properties. Different classifications had been produced by multiple sources over the years, leading ultimately to a diverse range of systems and definitions.\nEach state had implemented its own systems with specific terminologies. In the case of surveys and reports being provided by industries and businesses, additional classifications can apply. The same materials might be treated differently, in respect of the regulatory structures that categorise them as \"\" or \"\".\nThe National Waste Classification System was developed as a sub-project of the Australian Waste Database (AWD, 1990), but it was not widely implemented. Its benefits -for policymakers, local manufacturers and communities-, had been highlighted by the  (CSIRO), and yet a 2011 study disclosed that only  and the  were fully aligned with it, and only two states, namely  and , partly did so. In that occasion the Department of the Environment and Energy also expressed its commitment to submit a definitive, harmonised system. Advances towards a system standardisation are recent and correlated to legislative modifications occurred in the last fifteen years.\nOne of the definitions provided for \"waste\" has been that of the Victorian \"Environment Protection Act 1970\", which described it as \"any matter, whether solid, liquid, gaseous or radioactive, which is discharged, emitted or deposited in the environment in such volume, constituency or manner as to cause an alteration of the environment\".  The 2018 National Waste Report defined waste as \"materials or products that are unwanted or have been discarded, rejected or abandoned.\" That classification included recyclables and  materials within the waste category, and excluded those that were not subjected to reprocessing prior to being reused.\nIn general, three waste streams are identified in Australia:\n and hard waste collection are usually considered within the first category. Soft plastics, paper and organics are its key components.\nTimber, plastic and metals characterise the second category. They are considered to represent an optimal and valuable source of recycling materials.\nC&D waste products are usually inert, such as concrete, steel and earth that has been excavated.\nAustralian waste management had to comply over the years with a general scarcity of data from both businesses and institutions.  Statistical analyses, when provided, had been of varying usefulness to the governmental organs.\nMain issues have been attributed to the lack of consistency, methodology, field-related expertise and legislation effectiveness. In particular, the different systems, classifications and technical terminologies adopted by each jurisdiction, and required by the diverse stakeholders range and nature, increase the complexity in both the data collection and wrangling processes. Even where similarities are present, data can overlap. An inquiry made by a governmental office in 2006 reported the waste management sector data to be inconsistent, incomplete and subjected to biases.\nThe data level of confidence had underpinned the ability of producing resonant policies, and in particular those regarding a sustainable management of resources.\nThere had been attempts to create an harmonised system, however the success of such projects had been hampered by the management costs associated with reforming the legislation already in use. The first, not successful ones were made in the 1990s for reviewing the achievements of the 1992 \"National waste minimisation and recycling strategy\". The quality eventually improved in the following decade, but the different standards among the years also meant that trends could not be understood by just referencing to the various reports commissioned at that time.\nA more consistent data system started to be implemented after the release of the 2009 \"National waste policy\". It was developed and ratified by all the states in 2015 and currently six of its annual versions represent the national waste database.\n are implemented by some researches in order to reduce biases and minimise errors occurrence.\nThe framework onto which the legislation is currently working is what has been named \"The 3Rs plus 1\":  and . The approach is intended to be directed towards the circular economy principles. The system has received critics from researchers (who are not convinced of the actual circularity of the proposed economy), as well as from institutions that urge the concrete application of the principles thereof.\nThe main reason leading the critics is that that a true circular economy should prefer the avoidance of waste over its reuse and recycle (in alignment with the waste hierarchy principles), while no clear actions have been made towards the former goal.\nThe waste hierarchy describes the priorities linked to the waste management via a preferential order, on the basis of the efficiency of each of its strategies towards the production, use and disposal of a product. It is often represented as an inverse pyramid, grading from the top \"most preferable\" to the bottom \"least preferable\" solutions. The waste hierarchy sets efficiency as an aim, and over-consumption as an avoidable, unnecessary occurrence that can be diverted by appropriate changes in the .\nThe disposal of waste serves, theoretically, as the worst-case scenario; in practice, the usage of landfills is widely adopted. This happens because the hierarchy is not suitable in every circumstances: the evaluation of costs-benefits needs to be implemented in its consultation.\nIts application as a guide for national policies has been widely spread since the last decade of the 20th century, and it is central to the \"National Waste Minimization and Recycling Strategy\".\nThe various waste hierarchies implemented by each jurisdiction, although almost identical in functions and structures, have been enshrined in different acts, and at different times.  describes it in the \"Waste Reduction and Recycling Act 2011\"; in  is part of the foundations of the \"Environment Protection Act 1970\"; in NSW is mirrored by the \"Waste Avoidance and Recovery Act 2001\".\nFederal waste-related legislation is under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Environment and Energy.\nThe strategy was endorsed in 1992 and represented an action towards the Ecologically Sustainable Development (ESD). ESD was defined in 1990 by the Commonwealth Government as \"using, conserving and enhancing the community's resources so that ecological processes, on which life depends, are maintained, and the total quality of life, now and in the future, can be increased\" and the same definition had been used in the strategy.\nThe National Waste Minimization and Management Strategy developed as a corollary.\nThe strategy was developed under the \"National Strategy for Ecologically Sustainable Development\" in order to serve as a framework with which improvements and effective measures could be coordinated. In particular, it focused on hazardous waste and waste disposal.\nThe document represents a guidance for Australian institutions, outlining the actions needed to be pursued in order to reduce food waste by 2030. It is inspired by the ' Sustainable Development Goal 12: \"Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns\", and by the Country's commitment towards the reduction of  (heavily produced by organic compounds in landfills). The latter aligns with the .\nThe 2018 text succeed the National Waste Policy of 2009, and it represents the foundations on which governments and individual jurisdictions can relate in their legislative activities, while also stating their responsibilities. The policy encompasses the MSW, C&I and C&D streams, considering liquid, gaseous and solid waste and excluding radioactive materials.\nA total of sixteen waste strategies are exposed. It will be in use until 2030 and, while setting the guidelines for governments, specific local and regional circumstances considerations for businesses and communities can still be pondered and implemented \nThe document presents itself as with a circular economy footprint. Waste avoidance and recycling implementation are two of the five principles on which it is based.\n refers to the regulations that set a product management strategy which ensure that each sector involved in the lifecycle of a product (including production and disposal), shares a responsibility towards its environmental and human impacts. In Australia its regulation on a national basis has started in 2011 with the \"Product Stewardship Act\".\nThe act states the voluntary, co-regulatory and mandatory product stewardship and it implements the guidelines with which products must be thought of in terms of environment, health and safety.\nThe Department of the Environment and Energy annually publishes lists in which new regulated products are considered and included.\nThe first scheme developed under the act was \"The National Television and Computer Recycling Scheme\", in which both governments and industries were considered responsible of the . The last products introduced in its regulations include batteries, plastic  and  systems.\n were considered and listed as a major threat to wildlife in \"\" (EPBC) in 2003. Plastic is a prominent source of such debris and it was on this basis that the plan was established. In particular, it focuses on the actions needed in the research and in the understanding of the impacts of plastic and  on marine environments, and on the actions needed to minimise their effects.\nThe waste levy is a taxation imposed on the amount of waste disposed in landfills.\nWaste levies can determine the preferential approaches of the industry over waste function by encouraging alternative or traditional disposal and recovery technologies.\nIn terms of environmental impacts, an efficient usage of the contribution should incorporate their costs and benefits into the management of values thresholds.\nQueensland used to have a , but in 2013 the  repealed it. The levy was considered at that time not effective both economically and environmentally, as it would have unnecessarily increased managing costs to businesses and promoted . Other states, in the meantime, taxed landfill usage. In NSW, for example, the levy was introduced in the \"Protection of the Environment Operations (Waste) Regulation 2014\" and in 2018\u20132019 the standard levy in the metropolitan area reached $141.20 per tonne ($81.30 per tonne in the regional area). Queensland is planning to reintroduce the levy on 1 July 2019 in most of its local government areas.  It is projected that by the end of the first four years from the commencement of the levy, 70% of the incomes perceived will be redirected to councils, startups and other projects.\nDiverse factors are involved in the production of waste, namely economy, demography and geography.\nAustralia produces lots of waste; according to various studies, this is due to an economy based on an intensive use of materials, to population growth (as of September 2018, Australia counts more than 25 million people), population demographic and , and  GDP. In 2018, Australian GDP grew by 2.3%, and every year in Australia about 67 million tonnes of wasted are generated (~2.7tn per person). Municipal solid waste and commercial and industrial streams reduced their growth rates, while those of C&D increased in 2019.\nThe strategies adopted by lower chain links, as retailers, have also a role in the production or minimisation of waste. The general disbelief towards the positive effects of reusing and recycling have impacted the amounts generated.\nAbout 20% of the total waste generation is due to  in forms of ash and . Except for the Northern Territory and for Western Australia, 77% (or 150.9 TWh, terawatt per hour), of the total electricity provided by the  (NEM) in 2016\u20132017 was sourced from coal.\nLittering is a major issue in Australia, with $180 million per year spent in NSW only.\nA decrease in its occurrence has been registered, although Victoria and Western Australia have recorded an inverse trend. The former records 14,560 tonnes of litter generated per year, 75% of which is constituted of cigarette butts and packaging; in NSW the number increases up to 25,000.\nIn Australia members of the public can report littering practices to the local  (EPA) agencies, as declared by documents such as the Local Nuisance and Litter Control Act 2016 (SA). In Victoria, 20,000 reports are generated annually.\nAccording to the  (WWF), 95% of the plastic packaging is discarded after a single use. In March 2019 the organisation published \"Solving Plastic pollution through accountability\", a report issued on an international basis and which urged governments to stop accepting projects contemplating the use of . Additionally, it supported a global ban to single use plastics and requested the producers to be considered responsible for how their products are ultimately disposed of, and recycled. The single use plastics have been already banned in Europe.\nIn the same month of the WWF publication,   the first capital in Australia to ban single use plastics, although not without criticisms by the local businesses. The Tasmanian Small Business Council demanded a coordinated action between government and local businesses, that could have otherwise been damaged by a sudden and costly ban.\nOther states are pondering the ban, such as SA and , while in the meantime there are several cases of , like those in Queensland, Western Australia, Victoria and . South Australia banned them in 2009 already.\nCompanies and institutions, such as ,  and the , are banning the use of straws.\nIn July 2018,  banned plastic bags from its retail shops. The decision was followed by a consistent flux of critics from its shoppers and indecisions by the company. In NSW the decision of Coles and  to stop supplying single-use plastic bags set off many controversies. NSW is also the only state that has not yet formally took action against the use of single-use plastics, in what has been named the \"ban on bans\".\nAdvances in the reduction of single-use plastics are progressing on a nationwide view. The number of reusable cups sold and responsible cafes registered have fluctuated in 2018. Councils are repeatedly been asked questions by residents regarding the disposal of recycling, showing an increased interest in the subject matter.\nCollection services vary in terms of types provided and areas in which they are implemented The National Waste Report 2018, which is built upon data as of 2016\u20132017, reported that some services can be absent in certain locations (Table 1). In the same years, kerbside collection was available in 90% of the households from all the states, with the exception of the Northern Territory. The organics collection represented the less developed one with only 42% of the households having access to it -less than half the figure for both recycling and garbage collections.\nA research conducted by Pollinate and  in 2018 reported that the most requested recycling services by the households regarded, in order of prominence, organics, soft plastics and e-waste.\nSAP: service always, or nearly always provided; SUP: service usually provided; SRP service rarely, or sometimes provided.\nUncoordinated labelling has impacted the sorting processes antecedent the waste collection dynamics, which have been also influenced by the households' generally low education on labelling systems and on contamination of recyclables.\nA harmonised action has been taken by , PREP Design and the Australian Packaging Covenant Organisation, producing the Australasian Recycling Label (ARL) as a result. The label refers to each component of a package (for example, of both a bottle and its cap), and it states its end-of-use destination. The destination is distinguished in three categories: recyclables, not recyclables and conditionally recyclables. Conditionally recyclable products can be potentially recycled, but they might undergo further restrictions depending on the state or council. Examples of their destination can be either the red or yellow bins, or the store drop offs.\nThe system has been already implemented in the major market streams and some of its supporters include ,  and .\nThe requirements for colours, markings and designations are specified in AS 4123.7-2006 (R2017). The standards were first set in 2006 and they have been reconfirmed in 2017. They are also in use in New Zealand. In most of the councils, kerbside bins are labelled as follows:\nA 2018 report by Blue Environment estimated the average composition (by weight) of yellow-lid bins to mostly consist of paper (56%), followed by glass (25%), and then plastics, metals and other materials all in single figures. The adoption of a unique bin for a wide range of recyclables may cause contamination problems, but it has the side-effect of diminishing the number of trucks (and consequently ), required for the collection processes. The contamination of the materials collected causes the diversion of recyclables to landfills. Most of the kerbside collected waste in 2016\u20132017 was disposed of in landfills.\nSouth Australia has introduced container deposit schemes (CDS) since 1977; Northern Territory established them in 2012. They were the only two operative schemes in 2016\u20132017. SA had a return rate in that period that almost doubled that of the NT, reaching 80% with 587 million containers sold.\nCollected containers have been treated both domestically and overseas.\nThe collection of solid and recyclables materials from households, industries and other places usually leads to the transport towards  (MRF),  or landfill sites.\nMaterials recovery facilities, or materials reclamation facilities, or multi re-use facilities, receive the commingled materials from the collection trucks. They have the function of sorting and aggregate recyclables.\nMRFs are generally similar in structure and require both manual and automatic procedures (see video in this section). The former are especially useful when the materials received are particularly contaminated and/or do not respect the requirements for being sorted. However, the majority of MRFs in the country have deficiencies in sorting co-mingled MSW, leading to a rise in the levels of contamination.\nWaste reuse identifies those dynamics that lead to the reuse of materials that have been included at some stage into the waste management processes. Waste reuse has more positive effects on the economy than recycling for two reasons: firstly, the former has the potential to employ more people, and secondly, the value of reused waste materials is higher than that of recyclables. Australia annually recovers about 2 million tonnes by waste-to-energy approaches.\nOf all the Australian jurisdictions, Queensland is one of those with the worst recovery rates. It also appears to have low standards on an international basis. In the years spanning from 2007 to 2016, the state performances in the sector did almost not change at all. The estimates made by the Queensland's Department of Environment and Science revealed a recovery rate of less than 45% in the financial year 2016\u20132017. They represent a huge gap from those of the current leader, South Australia, which in the same year diverted from landfill more than 80% of its generated waste.\nThe figures for SA show that the geographical origin of waste, as well as its typology, strongly affect the diversion percentages. For example, C&D recorded a 89% recovery rate in the metropolitan area, and of 65% in the regional. However the commercial and industrial category performed better in regional SA (93%), rather than in the surroundings of  (82%). Municipal solid waste (MSW) diversion scored the lower percentages, reaching only 39% in the regional area.\nThe national recovered waste average floats around 58% to 61%. Queensland would need to divert almost 40% more than its current performance in order to reach it.\nRecycling aim is that of re-producing new or raw materials. The recycling industry in Australia is crucial in the realisation of the  objectives. It involves multiple sectors of waste management, and requires specific collection and sorting practices which precede the sale of recyclables.  The industry has many points to improve. South Korea, Taiwan and Japan, all countries with lower wealth per capita, have also higher recycling rates than Australia. Victoria is currently recycling 67% of its gross waste and has invested several millions dollars in grants for new infrastructures.\n\nIt has been estimated that in the financial year 2009\u201310, the recycling sector was worth $4.5 billion (AUD), with an additional $5 billion if the entire waste management industry is considered. In South Australia, which is currently the leader in the sector, resource recovery activities employ almost 5000 people and contribute more than half a billion Australian dollars to the SA Gross State Product (GSP).A problem with the Australian industry is the little domestic demand for the industry inputs, especially in rural areas where population density and access to kerbside collection are limited. When collection is available, the limited capacity of some infrastructures to recycle determinate materials poses an additional constraint. Only 10 Local Government Areas have introduced household waste collection for every type of recyclable plastics (including plastic bags), as of October 2018. However, there have been advances in the technological sector in the last decades, which either meant additional waste streams entering the recycling chain, or more sophisticated sorting procedures that ameliorated the rate of products actually recycled. In the decade from 1995 to 2005, about ~22% more newspapers have been recycled each year. At the same time, more than half a billion cans have been added to the recycling chain.\nA current issue is also the lack in households education on the matter, but a number of campaigns such as National recycling week are working on their sensitisation.\nPlastic materials can be reprocessed in a number of ways, with the result of being reconverted in a various range of new products, such as bottles and bins. Almost half the plastics sorted in Australia is processed locally, while the rest is exported to Asian markets. Soft plastics are only processed by RED Group in Melbourne and may be reused for flooring, roads and more.\nPaper and cardboard materials can also be reprocessed in diverse ways and examples of end products might be recycled office paper and card boxes. These processes are 55% done locally and China represents the primary importer.\nRoads, sands and glass bottles are all possible end products of glass recycling. As for the previous categories, glass can be processed in different ways. Differently from them, plant facilities are all on Australian soil. O-I Asia is the major company involved.\nMetals can be converted in a number of ways dependently on their characteristics.\nAluminium can be reused for cans as well as for aeroplanes, and the processing phase can occur in diverse ways. Aluminium processing facilities are mostly domestic, but there are also exports. Vietnam represents the major importer (8% of the total collected).\nCans receive similar treatments, but can be either reconverted in cans ex-novo, or being adapted into construction materials.\nConstruction and demolition materials are mostly exported in southeastern Asia, but some are processed locally. Road bases is the most common reuse of these materials.\nSorting practices involve manual labour, magnets and .\nApplications of  treated recyclables include the production of coins, screens and jewellery. E-waste such as mobile phones are source of glass, plastic, gold, copper and other materials, while computers and TVs necessitate two processing stages and can be reused as construction materials or as batteries. Other wasted components of this category can be elements with deleterious effects on the environment.\nIn Victoria, all the e-waste will be diverted from landfills and recycled from 1 July 2019. The state is planning to invest on new infrastructures and facilities.\nEnd products from printer cartridges may be applied in recycled inks and in road surfaces. Some Australian manufactures receive used cartridges for reuse.\nCoffee pods can be recycled and some companies as  have organised collection points and campaigns to help reduce their disposal issues. Coffee residuals are used as compost and aluminium can be used in diverse ways.\nOrganics may consist of materials such as , timber, forestry residuals,  or abattoir waste.\nSoil conditioners, potting mixes, mulches and manufactured soil are examples of possible reuses.\nThe industry is progressing in this sector, with major improvements deriving from the green-lid bin introduction. Construction and development of the processing facilities are increasing. There are, however, challenges.\nThe Australian Organics Recycling Association identified a number of them, all leading to uncertainty in the sector market which excludes small and medium enterprise from being competitive. Examples include the high costs related to the regulation of the processing faciliies, and financial risks.\nIn the world, as in Australia, one-third of the groceries are wasted every year. Food waste impacts the community on various sectors and its implications have started to be considered more often in the last ten years. It is considered a waste of resources and opportunities, but it also is a source of atmospheric emissions by producing methane when it is disposed of in landfills.\nIn Victoria, almost half of the typical MSW composition is represented by food waste, 65% of which is considered as \"avoidable waste\". On a national basis, up to AUD$3800 are spent each year by households for wasting food.\nAny fuel sourced from residual waste can be defined as , although the denomination usually refers to low-quality types. RDFs can either be integrated into treatment processes (i.e., incinerators), or used for other industrial practices. Their production and usage have been standardised at various levels by EPAs.\nRDFs can be provided by all the tree waste streams. If the fuel is sourced from biological waste (such as fibres and paper), it can be adopted in the renewable energy industry. However, organics need an additional processing before being used as fuel.\nIn 2018, the second, largest facility that converts waste into fuel opened in , Sydney.\nPyrolysis oil and syngas are products of pyrolysis and gasification processes respectively. They can be reused as green energy to produce energy as input fuels for industrial engines, or as chemical feedstock.\n,  and  are some of the thermal treatments into which waste can be diverted. They might be accompanied by energy recover.\nIn Australia, the waste-to-energy approach is becoming by the time more favoured by both councils and industries.\nThe major environmental pros of these practices consist of the decreasing adoption of , whose use compared to that of waste fuels may potentially produce more carbon dioxyde.\nIncinerators plants had sensibly developed over the years and now advanced pollution control devices enhance their environmental standards. The most up-to-date waste-to-energy plants ameliorate their ecological performances by capturing CO emissions produced by the combustion of fuels; carbon dioxide can also be then diverted and used by other processes. Pyrolysis and gasifications are some of the waste-to-energy approaches. These require the heating of waste in anaerobic conditions (without oxygen), in order to produce a fuel, the . The oil can subsequently be gasified to produce the .\nTechnologies to manage the emissions from these plants exist, but Australians are sceptic and concerned about them. There are also critics relating to the idea that waste used as fuel could weaken the recycling industry. They are supported by the fact that Australia has a little domestic demand in the sector of recyclables. However, incinerators could be a tool for diverging contaminated materials from landfills in a way that promotes the waste hierarchy principles.\nLiving in the proximity of an energy-from-waste facility can lead to  associated to . Heavy metals have been reported to occur within a certain radius from the incinerators. Other toxic pollutants, including , have been documented to be produced by the combustion processes. Landfills generate , a greenhouse gas naturally produced, but it is still discussed whether its emissions might be better than those of incinerators.\nThe preference of incinerators over landfills might be advantageous in social and political terms. While the latter has an end-of-life (filling) and requires the jurisdictions to find new sites, the former, although sharing the characteristic of not being wanted by the nearby households, does not need to move over time and will mainly affect only a relatively small area.\nQueensland and Victoria tends to incinerate more than other states. Western Australia started a project in 2018, while in NSW, in the same year, the construction of a waste-to-energy plant in western Sydney was refused.\nAustralia depends on landfill disposal. It represents a cheaper solution than others and this might have slowed down the advances in the recycling industry.\nLandfill siting must consider multiple factors such as , local natural habitats and distances from the urban centres. Most of the landfills are found in the metropolitan area of the states' capitals, with a major concentration in the southwest and southeast of Australia. It results in a highly clustered overview, with three-quarters of the total amount of waste produced collected in only 38 sites. The number of landfills has decreased in the last 30 years, but they have become bigger and more sophisticated. NSW has the largest disposal plant in Australia.\nLandfills are planned in order to manage the flow of leachate and gas produced by the waste. Products such as , which contains , and timber, that can contain  (CCA) if it has been treated, can potentially release these components into leachate. Methane, a gas with a greenhouse effect potential at least 25 times more stronger than that of  (CO), is emitted by biodegradable carbon sources materials within the landfill. Most advanced plants reuse methane emissions by combusting it in a waste-to-energy approach. A preferable solution -when considering waste hierarchy and climate change-, is that of adopting  and special bacteria for limiting the amount of emissions produced.\nThe last year in which Queensland imposed a landfill taxation was 2012. The emerging discrepancy between the levy legislation in Queensland and New South Wales supported the introduction of waste from interstate within the QLD borders, with the additional effects of pollution originated by transports.\nThese dynamics and the dominant role of the levy were confirmed in 2017 by the Supreme Court Judge who was in charge of an investigation commissioned by the Queensland offices. According to the investigation, the policy framework adopted by Queensland would had unlikely allowed a decrease in the quantity of waste from interstate. The prospect led to the recommendation of the re-introduction of the waste levy, and it was backed up by a positive response by the government. The levy is now expected to begin on 1 July 2019, and it will concern 39 out of 77 local government areas.\nWithin indigenous communities it can be more difficult to manage waste. This is particularly true where these communities live in remote areas, in which even machinery may be scarce. Transports, collection, associated costs and the indigenous way of thinking towards garbage are some of the main aspects that have been pondered.\nThe NSW \"Aboriginal Communities Waste Management Program\" and \"Aboriginal Land Clean Up and Prevention Program\" are some of the programs addressed to the Aboriginal communities.\nThe  program was established in 1972 and it is recognised on an international basis. It coordinates the UN's environmental projects and supports environmental-focused strategies in developing countries.\nThe global, non-binding action plan was a product of the , a United Nations (UN) conference on environment and development held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from  3 to 14 June 1992. The main purpose of the conference was that to persuade the governments to include environmental concerns within their economic development strategies.\nThe Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBC Act 1999), still in force, was the Australian response to the Agenda 21 commitments.\nThe  under the UNEP was ratified by Australia in 1992. Mainly focusing on international markets, in particular the international exports from richer to poorer countries, it had as main objective the control and regulation of hazardous waste disposal. As a legally binding agreement, it was supported in Australia by the Hazardous Waste Act, for which is considered as an offence the unregulated export of hazardous waste.\nUnder the OECD Australia has submitted in 2019 its third Environmental Performance Review related to the years 2017\u20132019. Strategies specifically linked to the Australian case on a national perspective are to be discussed between the organisation Environment Policy Committee members.\nAustralia used to rely on Asian markets, especially on China, for waste treatment and disposal.\nSince the Chinese \"National Sword\" policy came into effect in 2018, the waste management industry entered a crisis: of the 1,248,000 tonnes (30% of the total produced per annum) of recyclable materials sent to China only in 2016\u20132017, 99% had been affected. As an interim solution, exports have since shifted to, and enlarged, alternative markets, such as those in Vietnam and Indonesia. An increasing number of Asian Countries is also planning to limit import rates, increasing the urgency of a shift towards the circular economy and a reliable domestic industry.\nThe domestic policies in Australia did not include any clause in sharing risks associated with commodity prices with the recycling industries. The Chinese import restrictions led a fall in these prices and forced many to stockpile their materials while waiting for new market opportunities.\nWaste management practices, especially avoidance and recovery related to household materials, have been linked to consumer comportment. Illegal practices as littering and dumping are also connected to it. Targeted education and awareness campaigns are likely to affect these practices and, consequently, the effectiveness of the management outcomes. \u00a0\nMedia coverage and government campaigns have positively affected the public eye towards the recycling issues. Topics as single use plastics and packaging have received particular attention in the last decade.\nRecycling practices and recyclables production particularly depend on consumer awareness for future implementations. Industries, as well as communities, will be subjected to campaigns and their effectiveness is considered a challenge for local and state organisations.\nMany cases of product-consumer dynamics are actually perceived as unsustainable by both residents and organisations, but Australians are seen expecting government and industry inputs to firstly react to them. More than 85% of residents, the Australian Council of Recycling (ACOR) stated, agree with recycling practices. Where these non-spontaneous initiatives are offered for free, as some which developed in South Australia, the feedback has been recorded as particularly positive.\nItems such as photovoltaic cells and e-waste, however, are not feasible to dispose and usually require private expenses by the owners. In this case, the eco-prompt inspiring their discard is less apparent.\nLitter report is a strategic mean used nation-widely as a supplement to EPA in its investigations; it has been implemented in all the states: NSW, QLD, VIC, TAS, WA, SA, ACT and NT.\nIn 2015, NSW launched RIDonline, an online platform (as of 2019, still accessible), where the public can report illegal dumping practices. One of its objectives is to help the state picturing an evidence base from which construct future management strategies.\nResearches have shown that only about a quarter of the NSW residents actually think they can be caught for littering, and that those who realise measures can be taken against them for littering are not that numerous.\nDuring Easter time in 2017, EPA worked with other agencies, councils and companies such as McDonald's, on a statewide campaign against driver . The aim of the project was to remind people that fines and measures can be directed for littering in any place and time.\nThe campaign aimed to sensitise and educate households about themes such as littering. The main media utilised was television, and it has been considered a successful campaign.\nStarted in November 1996 by PlanetArk, the National Recycling Week consists of an annual media campaign, still in action, with educative roles as objective. It aims to sensitise the public eye on themes such as recycling and responsible resource managing. The next event National Recycling Week will take place in November 2019.\nResearches show that currently, in the world, there is enough to feed everyone, with about 3 billion people suffer from hunger or malnutrition. In Australia only, figures reach 3.6 millions.\nProjects against  had developed throughout the country, with the aim to feed people in need via edible products that would have been otherwise discarded.\nThe report was produced by the Alternative Waste Management Technologies and Practices Inquiry for the NSW government in 2000. Its purpose was to provide an informative background for the future waste management and technology implementations in the state. The framework onto which it was based on supported ecologically sustainable development and focused on technology, economy, society and environment.\nThe document started by questioning:\nand structured the report on the investigation of them.\nIt provided the illustration of the \"triple manifesto\", defined as the close relation shared by the State or regional technologies, practices and strategies in the context of waste management. The manifesto led to state the necessity of considering the different benefits that can derive from the usage of waste as a resource, before opting for less productive solutions as landfills. On these premises, the Inquiry suggested a reform in the NSW strategies which were then based on the disposal of waste as a preferential approach.\nThe NSW government started the  program in 2009 and conducted a series of tracking surveys until 2017, having food waste as the key interest. Covered topics ranged from meal planning and waste value to government role expectations and media influences.\nIn 2017 the survey was conducted online and 1389 residents participated to it. The outcomes suggested that Love Food Hate Waste campaigns and the media contents had positively impacted certain population sectors.\nIt also showed how environmental concerns are seldom related to food waste. More people had started to realise that they could throw away much less organics, but advances in this direction recorded in the previous study in 2015 had declined and in NSW more food was being wasted. Only 61% of the residents practised five or more waste avoidance behaviours, and packaging was still considered as the primary source of waste.\nThe 2017 study differed from the others since it added another question to the survey, related to the perception of avoidability pertinent to food wasting. Up to 27% of NSW residents were shown to not consider peels and bones as waste, while younger respondents considered items such as unfinished drinks as \"unavoidable\". Expired products and unfinished meals were the most popular reasons for wasting food, and meal planning recorded a decrease since the previous survey. Older segments of the sample reported to consider portion size more often than the younger.\n$1645.64 (AUD) was the weighted average answer when people were asked to estimate the annual waste costs produced. However, EPA had estimated at least $1260(AUD) more. 68% of the respondents, and 82% of those from an Asian background, supported the idea that the government should implement the reduction strategies in this waste category.\nThe National Waste Report is a series of documents endorsed by the Australian Government. It started in 2010 and as of 2019 four reports have been produced: in 2010, by the Environment Protection and Heritage Council (EPHC); in 2013; in 2016, by Blue Environment Pty Ltd for the Department of the Environment and Energy; and 2018.\nTheir studies span one financial year each and provide statistics and commentary on several aspects of waste management by using different key focuses (for example, on a  basis).  From 2016 onwards, the reports have been supported by the National Waste Data System (NWDS) and the National Waste Database.\nThe National Litter Index of 2017\u20132018 was the twelfth survey conducted by . Rather than answer to \"why\", its descriptive objectives regarded the \"where\" and the \"hows\" of littering nationwide. The index revealed that the counted amount of litter decreased of 10.3% in comparison to the previous year data, although in VIC and WA it had actually increased. The takeaway packaging was the category which differentiated the most, with a decrease of almost 17%. The major reductions were observed in NT (34%), and less of half that figure was recorded in NSW and SA.\nIn terms of sites, beach littering and shopping areas registered the biggest and smaller decrease respectively (22.5%, 12.9%). Thirty-eight litter items per one squared kilometre was the average estimated on a national basis, with retail strip malls as density hotspots.\nThe survey was conducted in parallel by Pollinate and Planet Ark. It illustrated the recycling activities and perceptions of Australians, as well as undercover anecdotes and propose potential alternatives such as the circular economy.\n\"Waste away: a deep dive into Australia's waste management\" was a podcast episode launched on 20 February 2019.\nAccording to its participants, in NSW 72% of the people who have been surveyed would recycle more if a more reliable recycling system was offered. It revealed that in Victoria the knowledge about household waste collection was generally good, but such a result was not evident on landfill and recycling topics. It also showed that waste was generally accepted as an essential service, although the household responsibility was lower in the public eye compared to those of businesses, companies and government.\nIn 1974, in Londonderry, , western Sydney, what was supposed to be a temporary plant was build. It was the response from the local government to an issue relating the disposal of liquid waste in the metropolitan area of Sydney, which was worsening as a result of the clandestine activities and of the shut down of the previous plant in , Sydney.\nThe disposal depot was originally supposed to operate for a maximum of two years, exclusively disposing of non-toxic waste. De facto, operations protracted for more than twenty years under a series of legislative variations and approved extensions. It was only when the local residents organised themselves under the name of \"Londonderry Residents Action Group for the Environment\", aka R.A.G.E., in 1989, that an effective and definitive action was requested by the administrators. Inspections, that were funded by the Waste Service NSW, supported by RAGE and investigated by \"\" (TEC), concluded that within the materials being treated a dangerously non predictable miscellany of compounds -including hazardous ones-, were introduced in the normal flow of waste in the plant. In addition, defaults in the system allowed liquids to escape as leacheate, contaminating what had become in the meantime a residential area. RAGE alleged that numerous, misleading documents and reports were given by the Metropolitan Waste Disposal Authority, NSW (MDWA) and by the Waste Management Authority (WMA), which in turn reported to the police that no dispersion had ever occurred.\nThe plant was eventually closed in 1998, probably because of political rather than environmental concerns.\nThe  held in Sydney in 2000 succeeded a massive cleansing in the city, where unrecorded disposal sites containing hazardous waste were discovered.\nIn July 2017 and again in 2018, a recycling plant in Queensland, owned by SKM Recycling, took fire for several days, causing severe health, environmental and financial issues.\nThe  plant had been receiving household recyclables from the Melbourne area, which it stockpiled as one of the consequences of China's National Sword \u00a0-ultimately increasing the risks for fire hazard. As a consequence, EPA blocked further waste flows in the facility on February 2019, causing the kerbside collections to be directed to landfills.\nSKM Recycling have been legally prosecuted and charged with environmental offence on March 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},

Packaging waste is a dominant contributor in today's world and responsible for half of the waste in the globe.\nThe recycling rate in 2015 for containers and packaging was 53 percent. Furthermore, the process of burning of containers and packaging was 7.2 million tons (21.4 percent of total combustion with ). Following the  that received 29.4 million tons (21.4 percent of total land filling) within the same year.\nAs packaging waste  the Earth, all life on Earth experiences  that affected their lifestyle. Marine or land-living animals are suffocating due to the pollution of packaging waste. This is a major issue for low income countries who do not have an efficient waste management system to clean up their environments and being the main sources for the global ocean pollution. Also, individuals who lack the motivation to recycle and instead leave their trash everywhere they went. The current location with greatest amount of solid waste that includes most of packaging products is the  located at West Coast of North America to Japan.  Most packaging waste that eventually goes into the ocean often comes from places such as lakes, steams, and .\nPossible solutions to reducing packaging waste are very simple and easy and could start with  of  ranging up to a  strategy (package-free products). However, examples of effective ways to help reduce packaging pollution include banning the use of  plastics, more social awareness and education, promotion of  alternatives, public pressure, voluntary cleaning up, and adopting reusable or  bags.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBottles and jars for drinks and storing foods or juices are examples of glass containers. It's been estimated by the EPA that 9.1 million tons of glass containers were generated in 2015, or 3.5 percent of municipal solid waste (MSW).  Frankly, about 70 percent of glass consumption is used for containers and packaging purposes. At least 13.2 percent of the production of glass and containers are burned with energy recovery.  The amount of glass containers and packaging going into the land fill is about 53 percent.\n\nAluminum container and packaging waste usually comes from cans from any kind of beverages, but foil can also be another that contributes it as well. It's been given that about 25 percent of aluminum is used for packaging purposes. Using the Aluminum Association Data, it has been calculated that at least  1.8 million tons of aluminum packaging were generated in 2015 or 0.8 percent MSW produced. Of those that are produced, only about 670,000 tons of aluminum containers and packaging were recycled, about 54.9 percent.  And, the ones that ends up in the land fill is 50.6 percent.\n\nThe production of steel containers and packaging mostly comes in cans and other things like steel barrels. Only about 5 percent of steel use for packaging purposes of the total world of steel consumption which makes it the least amount wasted and the most recycled. It's totaled that 2.2 million tons or 0.9 percent of MSW generated in 2015. While according to the Steel Recycling Institute, an estimate of 1.6 million tons (73 percent) of steel packaging were recycled.  Adding on, the steel packaging that were combusted with energy recover was about 5.4 percent and 21.6 percent were land filled. \nThe most of it being generated, and within the MSW in 2015, was  coming with at least 31.3 million tons (11.3 percent total) produced. However, it also the top most recycled at 28.9 million tons (92.3 percent) boxes being recycled in 2015.\nLater on, they are then combusted which makes 0.5 million tons and landfills received 1.9 million tons.  Other than corrugated boxes, cartons, bags, sacks, wrapping papers, and other boxes used for shoes or cosmetics are other examples of paper and paperboard containers and packaging. The total amount of MSW generated for paper and paperboard containers and packaging was 39.9 million tons or 15.1 percent in 2015. Although, the recycled rate is about 78.2 percent and 4.3 percent of small proportions were combusted with  and 17.6 percent in landfill.\nWood packaging is anything that is made out of wood used for packaging purposes (e.g. wood crates, wood chips, boards, and planks). Wood packaging is still highly use in today's world for transporting goods. According to EPA's data that were borrowed from the  Virginia Polytechnic Institute and the United States Department of Agriculture's Forest Service Southern Research Station, 9.8 million tons (3.7 percent of total MSW) of wood packaging were made in production in 2015.  Also, in 2015, the amount that was recycled 2.7 million tons. Moreover, its estimated that 14.3 percent of the wood containers and packaging waste generated was combusted with energy recovery, while the  58.6 percent went to the land filled. \n\nPlastic containers and packaging can be found in , , milk and water jugs, and more. EPA used data from the  to estimate that 14.7 million tons (5.5 percent of MSW generation) of  and  were created in 2015.  The overall amount that is recycled is about 2.2 million tons (14.6 percent).  In addition, 16.8 percent were combusted with energy recover and 68.6 percent went straight into the land fill. Most of the plastics are made from   (PET),   (HDPE),  (LDPE),  (PVC),  (PS),  (PP) and other resins. That being said, the recycling rate for  and jars was 29.9 percent (890,000 tons) and the recycling of HDPE water and milk jugs was 30.3 percent (230,000 tons).\n, a horrific sight in water systems and public places, mostly consists of packaging waste. Besides the disfigurement of the landscape, it also poses a health hazard for various life forms.  Packaging materials such as glass and plastic bottles are the main constituents of litter. It has a huge impact on the marine environment as well, when animals are caught in or accidentally consume plastic packaging.\nThe production of packaging material is the main source of the air pollution that is being spread globally. Some emissions comes from accidental fires or activities that includes incineration of packaging waste that releases vinyl chloride, CFC, and hexane.  For a more direct course, emissions can originate in land fill sites which could release CO2 and methane. Most CO2 comes from steel and glass packaging manufacturing.\n\nPackaging waste can come from land based or marine sources. The current location that has the makes up the large of amount of water pollution is the Great Pacific Garbage Patch located at West Coast of North America to Japan.  Marine sources such as rivers that caught packaging materials and are eventually lead into the oceans. In global standards, about 80 percent of packaging waste in ocean comes from land based sources and 20 percent comes from marine sources. The 20 percent of packaging waste that comes from marine sources comes from the rivers of China starting from least to greatest contributors, the Hanjiang, Zhujiang, Dong, Huangpu, Xi, and Yangtze river. All other marine sources comes from rivers of Africa and Southeast Asia.\n\nMost marine species and wildlife species suffer from the following:\n\n (BPA),   and  can be found in certain packaging waste.  BPA can affect the hearts of women, permanently damage the DNA of mice, and appear to be entering the human body from a variety of unknown sources. Studies from Journal of American Association shows that higher bisphenol A levels were significantly associated with , , and abnormally high levels of certain .  Toxins such as these are found within our food chains. When fish or plankton consume , it can also enter our food chain. Microplastics  was also found in common table salt and in both tap and . Microplastics are dangerous as the toxins can affect the human body's nervous, respiratory, and reproductive system.\nGovernments working with industries could support the development and promotion of sustainable alternatives in order to phase out single-use plastics progressively. If governments were to introduce economic incentives, supporting  projects which upscale or recycle single-use items and stimulating the creation of micro-enterprises, they could contribute to the uptake of eco-friendly alternatives to single-use plastics.\nSocial awareness and education is also one of the ways to help contribute to issues similar to helping reducing packaging waste.  Using the media gives quick access for the individuals or groups to spread information and awareness in regarding to letting the public know what is going on in the world and ways that others can contribute to assist in fixing problems of packaging wastes. Schools are also good for spreading the education with factual knowledge, possible outcomes for the increase of packaging waste, and provide ways to get individuals to give a helping hand in keeping our planet clean. Public awareness strategies can include a wide range of activities designed to persuade and educate. These strategies may focus not only on the reuse and recycling of resources, but also on encouraging responsible use and minimization of waste generation and litter.\n"},

In the European Union, the semantic definition is 'mixed municipal waste,' given waste code 20 03 01 in the European Waste Catalog. Although the waste may originate from a number of sources that has nothing to do with a municipality, the traditional role of municipalities in collecting and managing these kinds of waste have produced the particular etymology 'municipal.'\nThe composition of municipal solid waste varies greatly from  to municipality, and it changes significantly with time. In municipalities which have a well developed waste recycling system, the waste stream mainly consists of intractable wastes such as  and non-recyclable . At the start of the 20th century, the majority of domestic waste (53%) in the UK consisted of  from open fires.\nIn developed areas without significant recycling activity it predominantly includes ,  and product packaging materials, and other miscellaneous solid wastes from residential, commercial, institutional, and industrial sources. Most definitions of municipal solid waste do not include , agricultural wastes, , radioactive waste or . Waste collection is performed by the  within a given area. The term  relates to waste left from household sources containing materials that have not been separated out or sent for processing.  can be classified in several ways but the following list represents a typical classification:\nFor example, typical municipal solid waste in China is composed of 55.9% food residue, 8.5% paper, 11.2% plastics, 3.2% textiles, 2.9% wood waste, 0.8% rubber, and 18.4% non-combustibles.\nThe municipal solid waste industry has four components: , , , and  via incineration. There is no single approach that can be applied to the management of all waste streams, therefore the , a  agency, developed a hierarchy ranking strategy for municipal solid waste. The  is made up of four levels ordered from most preferred to least preferred methods based on their environmental soundness: Source reduction and reuse; recycling or composting; ; treatment and disposal.\nThe functional element of collection includes not only the gathering of solid waste and recyclable materials, but also the transport of these materials, after collection, to the location where the collection vehicle is emptied. This location may be a materials processing facility, a transfer station or a landfill disposal site.\nWaste handling and separation involves activities associated with waste management until the waste is placed in storage containers for collection. Handling also encompasses the movement of loaded containers to the point of collection. Separating different types of waste components is an important step in the handling and storage of solid waste at the source of collection.\nThe types of means and facilities that are now used for the recovery of waste materials that have been separated at the source include curbside ('kerbside' in the UK) collection, drop-off and buy-back centers. The separation and processing of wastes that have been separated at the source and the separation of commingled wastes usually occur at a materials recovery facility, transfer stations, combustion facilities and treatment plants.\nThis element involves two main steps. First, the waste is transferred from a smaller collection vehicle to larger transport equipment. The waste is then transported, usually over long distances, to a processing or disposal site.\nToday, the disposal of wastes by land filling or land spreading is the ultimate fate of all solid wastes, whether they are residential wastes collected and transported directly to a landfill site, residual materials from  (MRFs), residue from the combustion of solid waste, , or other substances from various solid waste processing facilities. A modern sanitary landfill is not a dump; it is an engineered facility used for disposing of solid wastes on land without creating nuisances or hazards to public health or safety, such as the problems of insects and the contamination of .\nIn the recent years environmental organizations, such as  or , have been gaining popularity for their online reuse networks. These networks provide a worldwide online registry of unwanted items that would otherwise be thrown away, for individuals and nonprofits to reuse or recycle. Therefore, this free Internet-based service reduces landfill pollution and promotes the .\n are created by land dumping. Land dumping methods vary, most commonly it involves the mass dumping of waste into a designated area, usually a hole or sidehill. After the waste is dumped, it is then compacted by large machines. When the dumping cell is full, it is then \"sealed\" with a plastic sheet and covered in several feet of dirt. This is the primary method of dumping in the United States because of the low cost and abundance of unused land in North America. Landfills are regulated in the US by the , which enforces standards provided in the , such as requiring liners and groundwater monitoring. This is because landfills pose the threat of pollution and can contaminate ground water. The signs of pollution are effectively masked by disposal companies and it is often hard to see any evidence. Usually landfills are surrounded by large walls or fences hiding the mounds of debris. Large amounts of chemical odor eliminating agent are sprayed in the air surrounding landfills to hide the evidence of the rotting waste inside the plant.\nMunicipal solid waste can be used to generate energy. Several technologies have been developed that make the processing of MSW for energy generation cleaner and more economical than ever before, including landfill gas capture, combustion, , , and . While older waste incineration plants emitted a lot of pollutants, recent regulatory changes and new technologies have significantly reduced this concern.  (EPA) regulations in 1995 and 2000 under the  have succeeded in reducing emissions of  from  facilities by more than 99 percent below 1990 levels, while mercury emissions have been reduced by over 90 percent. The EPA noted these improvements in 2003, citing waste-to-energy as a power source \"with less environmental impact than almost any other source of \".\n"},
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_waste", "title": "IndustrialwasteWikipedia", "body": " is the waste produced by industrial activity which includes any material that is rendered useless during a manufacturing process such as that of , industries, mills, and mining operations. Types of industrial waste include dirt and gravel, masonry and concrete, scrap metal, oil, solvents, chemicals, scrap lumber, even vegetable matter from restaurants. Industrial waste may be solid, liquid or gaseous. It may be hazardous or non-hazardous waste. Hazardous waste may be toxic, ignitable, corrosive, reactive, or radioactive. Industrial waste may pollute the air, the soil, or nearby water sources, eventually ending up in the sea. Industrial waste is often mixed into municipal waste, making accurate assessments difficult. An estimate for the US goes as high as 7.6 billion tons of industrial waste produced every year. Most countries have enacted legislation to deal with the problem of industrial waste, but strictness and compliance regimes vary. Enforcement is always an issue.\n, , industrial solid waste and  are designations of industrial wastes.  plants can treat some industrial wastes, i.e. those consisting of  such as  (BOD). Industrial wastes containing  pollutants or high concentrations of other pollutants (such as ) require specialized treatment systems. ( ).\nIndustrial wastes can be classified on the basis of their characteristics:\nFactories and power plants are typically located near bodies of water due to the need for large amounts of water as an input to the manufacturing process, or for equipment cooling. Many areas that are becoming industrialized do not yet have the resources or technology to dispose off the waste with lesser effects on the environment. Both untreated and partially treated wastewater are commonly fed back into a near lying body of water. Metals, chemicals and sewage released into bodies of water directly affect marine ecosystems and the health of those who depend on the waters as food or drinking water sources. Toxins from the wastewater can kill off marine life or cause varying degrees of illness to those who consume these marine animals, depending on the contaminant. Metals and chemicals released into bodies of water affect the . Effective manners in properly removing waste \nWastewater containing nitrates and phosphates often causes  which can kill off existing life in the water. A Thailand study focusing on water pollution origins found that the highest concentrations of water contamination in the U-tapao river had a direct correlation to industrial wastewater.\nAnother obvious effect of industrial waste is air pollution resulting from fossil fuel burning. This affects the lives of many people because this spreads illnesses. Over time, this issue that has been widespread. Several environmental issues have a devastating effect on third world countries because they don't have sufficient resources to solve this particular issue. This also effects the quality of soil because farmers have to try and deal with this massive issue. In addition, nitrogen dioxide is a common air pollutant found in the air. Air pollutants have a devastating effect on the human population because it causes sicknesses. Ammonia also causes a lot of respiratory problems that can be contracted from the air. \"Illnesses that can occur from air pollution range from irritation to eyes, skin, nose, or throat. There is also a chance to get  or  both being very dangerous. Commonly, people have reported to have gotten headaches, nauseam and dizziness from air pollution.\" The WHO or The World Health Organization has stated that air pollution is the worst risk in terms of human health. Air pollution has been around for a long time. Indoor air pollution is also a risk for humans. This type of air pollution is caused of the burning of solid fuels mostly from cooking or heating.\nOne of the most devastating effects of industrial waste is water pollution. For most industrial processes, heavy amount of water is used which comes in contact with harmful chemicals. These chemicals are usually metals or radioactive material. This heavily effects the environment because most of waste ends up in oceans, lakes, or rivers. As a result, water becomes polluted posing as health hazard to everyone.  Farmers rely on this water but if the water is polluted, then crops that are produced can become polluted. These effect the health of society because if industrial companies can't clean up their waste, this begins to affect the life of humans but also animals. Sea creature\u2019s health are affected because their lives become endangered by this polluted water. Water pollution can have devastating effects on the human body with the main ones being infections from bacteria, parasites, and chemicals. \"Diseases that humans can be exposed from drinking unsafe water range from cholera, typhoid, or .\"\nIn  the roles in  (MSW) management and industrial waste management are organized by the Royal Thai Government, which is organized as central (national) government, regional government, and local government. Each government is responsible for different tasks. The central government is responsible for stimulating regulation, policies, and standards. The regional governments are responsible for coordinating the central and local governments. The local governments are responsible for waste management in their governed area. However, the local governments do not dispose of the waste by themselves but instead hire private companies that have been granted the right from the Pollution Control Department (PCD) in Thailand. The main companies are Bangpoo Industrial Waste Management Center, General Environmental Conservation Public Company Limited (GENCO), SGS Thailand, Waste Management Siam LTD (WMS), and Better World Green Public Company Limited (BWG). These companies are responsible for the waste they have received from their customers before releasing it to the environment, burying it.\nThe 1976  (RCRA) provides for federal regulation of solid waste in the United States. The  (EPA) has issued national regulations regarding the handling, treatment and disposal of wastes. EPA has authorized individual state environmental agencies to implement and enforce the RCRA regulations through approved  programs.\nState compliance is monitored by EPA inspections. In the case that waste management guideline standards are not met, action against the site will be taken. Compliance errors may be corrected by enforced cleanup directly by the site responsible for the waste or by a third party hired by that site. Prior to the enactment of the  (1972) and RCRA, open dumping or releasing wastewater into nearby bodies of water were common waste disposal methods. The negative externalities on human health and environmental health led to the need for such a regulations. The RCRA framework provides specified subsections defining nonhazardous and hazardous waste materials and how each should be properly managed and disposed of. Guidelines for the disposal of nonhazardous solid waste includes the banning of open dumping. Hazardous waste is monitored in a  fashion. The EPA now manages 2.96 million tons of solid, hazardous and industrial waste. Since establishment, the RCRA program has undergone reforms as inefficiencies arise and as waste management evolves.\nThe  of 1963 and Air Quality Act of 1967 was one of the first moves to start legislating air pollution. It also provided a stricter enforcement on interstate air pollution. The clean Air Act of 1970:Increased legislation to limit pollution. For example, mobile sources such as cars, trucks, and industrial sources were on watch by the government. This acts goal was to regulate the spread of ozone, nitrogen dioxide, lead, monoxide, and sulfur dioxide. These six pollutants were categorized as the most common ones according to EPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency). Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977: Air quality areas that were under the effect of  (the National Ambient Air Quality Standards) had increased attention to prevent PSD (Prevention of Significant Deterioration). Clean Water Act: CWA of 1972 protects certain areas from waste. Industrial companies are not able to dump in these areas because they are protected by CWA. These are set in places to watch the quality of water.All of these acts have helped to manage pollution in the United States but there is much progress left. With pollution being the leading cause of death as pointed out by Richard Fuller. With plans that are under progress, it will not be cheap to maintain pollution in the United States. \nLevels of water pollution have increased causing diarrhea infections in infants. It has costed around $100 billion to sustain the quality of air and water in China, but if China ignores the quality of water pollution it will worsen. The burning of coal is one the leading causes of air pollution in China, forcing people to wear face masks when going in public. Issues from pollution arise from power plants and factories. This was a report from urban residents who are trying to convince the government to help. The government has tried to manage heavy industry. There are multiple different ways of managing industrial waste. At times there needs to be stricter policies for companies who deal with industrial waste. According to an article, waste heat is often produced and thrown into the environment. Waste heat is produced by water evaporation by the industry. Fossil fuel can be reduced when waste heat is used by industries for their advantage. Most effort to reduce industrial waste come from lifestyle changes from humans and more enforcement to the environment.\nIn order to improve air quality in London, there has been of fund of 20 million pounds. This came from the Our Mayor\u2019s Air Quality Fund (MAQF). London implemented 12 Emission Low Bus Areas. This helps reduce toxic fumes that are released from vehicles. London is in the same situation as in the United States when it comes to managing pollution.\n"},

All such processes give off some waste heat as a fundamental result of the . Waste heat has lower utility (or in thermodynamics lexicon a lower  or higher ) than the original energy source.  Sources of waste heat include all manner of human activities,  natural systems, and all organisms, for example,  get hot, a refrigerator warms the room air, an  generates high-temperature exhaust gases, and electronic components get warm when in operation.\nInstead of being \"wasted\" by release into the ambient environment, sometimes waste heat (or cold) can be utilized by another process (such as using hot engine coolant to heat a vehicle), or a portion of heat that would otherwise be wasted can be reused in the same process if make-up heat is added to the system (as with  in a building).\n, which includes technologies both for short- and long-term retention of heat or cold, can create or improve the utility of waste heat (or cold).  One example is waste heat from air conditioning machinery stored in a buffer tank to aid in night time heating. Another is  (STES) at a foundry in Sweden.  The heat is stored in the bedrock surrounding a cluster of heat exchanger equipped boreholes, and is used for space heating in an adjacent factory as needed, even months later. An example of using STES to utilize natural waste heat is the  in , Canada, which, by using a cluster of boreholes in bedrock for interseasonal heat storage, obtains 97 percent of its year-round heat from solar thermal collectors on the garage roofs. Another STES application is storing winter cold underground, for summer air conditioning.\nOn a biological scale, all organisms reject waste heat as part of their , and will die if the ambient temperature is too high to allow this.\nAnthropogenic waste heat is thought by some to contribute to the  effect. The biggest point sources of waste heat originate from machines (such as electrical generators or industrial processes, such as steel or glass production) and heat loss through building envelopes.  The burning of transport fuels is a major contribution to waste heat.\nMachines  contained in  to  or  produce heat as a by-product.\nIn the majority of energy applications, energy is required in multiple forms.  These energy forms typically include some combination of: ,  and .  Often, these additional forms of energy are produced by a , running on a source of high-temperature heat.  A heat engine can never have perfect efficiency, according to the , therefore a heat engine will always produce a surplus of low-temperature heat.  This is commonly referred to as waste heat or \"secondary heat\", or \"low-grade heat\".  This heat is useful for the majority of heating applications, however, it is sometimes not practical to transport heat energy over long distances, unlike electricity or fuel energy.\nThe largest proportions of total waste heat are from  and vehicle engines.  The largest single sources are power stations and industrial plants such as  and  plants.\nThe  of  is defined as the ratio between the input and output energy. It is typically only 33% when disregarding usefulness of the heat output for building heat.\nThe images show  which allow power stations to maintain the low side of the temperature difference essential for conversion of heat differences to other forms of energy. Discarded or \"Waste\" heat that is lost to the environment may instead be used to advantage.\nIndustrial processes, such as ,  or  are major sources of waste heat.\nAlthough small in terms of power, the disposal of waste heat from  and other electronic components, represents a significant engineering challenge. This necessitates the use of fans, , etc. to dispose of the heat.\nFor example, data centers use electronic components that consume electricity for computing, storage and networking. The French  explains a data center is like a resistance and most of the energy it consumes is transformed into heat and requires cooling systems.\nAnimals, including humans, create heat as a result of .  In warm conditions, this heat exceeds a level required for  in  animals, and is disposed of by various  methods such as  and .  Fiala  modelled human thermoregulation.\nLow temperature heat contains very little capacity to do work (), so the heat is qualified as waste heat and rejected to the environment. Economically most convenient is the rejection of such heat to water from a ,  or . If sufficient cooling water is not available, the plant has to be equipped with a  to reject the waste heat into the atmosphere.\nIn some cases it is possible to use waste heat, for instance in heating homes by . However, by slowing the release of the waste heat, these systems always entail a reduction of efficiency for the primary user of the heat energy.\nWaste of the by-product heat is reduced if a  system is used, also known as a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) system. Limitations to the use of by-product heat arise primarily from the engineering cost/efficiency challenges in effectively exploiting small temperature differences to generate other forms of energy.  Applications utilizing waste heat include  heating and . In some cases, cooling can also be produced by the use of  for example, in this case it's called  or CCHP (combined cooling, heat and power).\nWaste heat can be forced to heat incoming fluids and objects before being highly heated. For instance outgoing water can give its waste heat to incoming water in a  before heating in homes or .\nThere are many different approaches to transfer thermal energy to electricity, and the technologies to do so have existed for several decades. The , offered by companies such as , is a very known approach, whereby an organic substance is used as  instead of water.  The benefit is that this process can reject heat at lower temperatures for the production of electricity than the regular water steam cycle.  An example of use of the steam  is the .\nAnother established approach is by using a , such as those offered by , where a change in temperature across a semiconductor material creates a voltage through a phenomenon known as the . A related approach is the use of , where a temperature difference gives rise to an electric current in an electrochemical cell.\nAnthropogenic heat is heat generated by humans and human activity. The  defines it as \"Heat released to the atmosphere as a result of human activities, often involving combustion of fuels. Sources include industrial plants, space heating and cooling, human metabolism, and vehicle exhausts. In cities this source typically contributes 15\u201350 W/m to the local heat balance, and several hundred W/m in the center of large cities in cold climates and industrial areas.\"\nEstimates of  heat generation can be made by totaling all the  used for heating and cooling, running appliances, transportation, and industrial processes, plus that directly emitted by human .\nAnthropogenic heat is a small influence on rural temperatures, and becomes more significant in dense  areas. It is one contributor to . Other human-caused effects (such as changes to , or loss of evaporative cooling) that might contribute to urban heat islands are not considered to be  by this definition.\nAnthropogenic heat is a much smaller contributor to  than are . In 2005, although anthropogenic waste heat flux was significantly high in certain urban areas (and can be high regionally). For example, waste heat flux was +0.39 and +0.68 W/m for the continental United States and western Europe, respectively) globally it accounted for only 1% of the  created by anthropogenic greenhouse gases. Global forcing from waste heat was 0.028 W/m in 2005. This statistic is predicted to rise as urban areas become more widespread.\nAlthough waste heat has been shown to have influence on regional climates,  from waste heat is not normally calculated in state-of-the-art global climate simulations. Equilibrium climate experiments show statistically significant continental-scale surface warming (0.4\u20130.9\u00a0\u00b0C) produced by one 2100 AHF scenario, but not by current or 2040 estimates. Simple global-scale estimates with different growth rates of anthropogenic heat that have been actualized recently show noticeable contributions to global warming, in the following centuries. For example, a 2% p.a. growth rate of waste heat resulted in a 3 degree increase as a lower limit for the year 2300. Meanwhile, this has been confirmed by more refined model calculations.\nOne research showed that if anthropogenic heat emissions continue to rise at the current rate, they will become a source of warming as strong as GHG emissions in the 21 century.\n"},

A hazardous waste is a special type of waste because it cannot be disposed of by common means like other by-products of our everyday lives. Depending on the physical state of the waste, treatment and solidification processes might be required.\nWorldwide, the  (UNEP) estimated that more than 400 million tons of hazardous wastes are produced universally each year, mostly by industrialized countries (Schmit, 1999). About 1 percent of this is shipped across international boundaries, with the majority of the transfers occurring between countries in the Organization for the Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) (Krueger, 1999). One of the reasons for industrialized countries to ship the hazardous waste to industrializing countries for disposal is the rising cost of disposing of hazardous waste in the home country.\nHazardous wastes are wastes with properties that make them dangerous or potentially harmful to human health or the environment. Hazardous wastes can be liquids, solids, contained gases, or sludges. They can be by-products of manufacturing processes or simply discarded commercial products, like cleaning fluids or pesticides. In regulatory terms, RCRA hazardous wastes are  wastes that appear on one of the four hazardous wastes lists (F-list, K-list, P-list, or U-list), or exhibit at least one of the following four characteristics; ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity, or toxicity. in the US, Hazardous wastes are regulated under the , Subtitle C.\nBy definition, EPA determined that some specific wastes are hazardous. These wastes are incorporated into lists published by the Agency. These lists are organized into three categories: F-list (non-specific source wastes) found in the regulations at 40 CFR 261.31, K-list (source-specific wastes) found in the regulations at 40 CFR 261.32, and P-list and the U-list (discarded commercial chemical products) found in the regulations at 40 CFR 261.33.\nRCRA's record keeping system helps to track the life cycle of hazardous waste and reduces the amount of hazardous waste illegally disposed.\nThe  (CERCLA), was enacted in 1980.  The primary contribution of CERCLA was to create a \"\" and provide for the clean-up and remediation of closed and abandoned hazardous waste sites. CERCLA addresses historic releases of hazardous materials, but does not specifically manage hazardous wastes.\nIn the United States, the treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous waste are regulated under the   (RCRA).  Hazardous wastes are defined under RCRA in 40 CFR 261 where they are divided into two major categories: characteristic wastes and listed wastes.\nThe requirements of the RCRA apply to all the companies that generate hazardous waste as well as those companies that store or dispose  hazardous waste in the United States. Many types of businesses generate hazardous waste. ,  repair shops, hospitals, , and  centers may all generate hazardous waste. Some hazardous waste generators are larger companies such as chemical ,  companies, and .\nA U.S. facility that treats, stores, or disposes of hazardous waste must obtain a permit for doing so under the . Generators and transporters of hazardous waste must meet specific requirements for handling, managing, and tracking waste. Through the RCRA, Congress directed the  (EPA) to create regulations to manage hazardous waste. Under this mandate, the EPA developed strict requirements for all aspects of hazardous waste management including the treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous waste. In addition to these federal requirements, states may develop more stringent requirements that are broader in scope than the federal regulations.  Furthermore, RCRA allows states to develop regulatory programs that are at least as stringent as RCRA and, after review by EPA, the states may take over responsibility for the implementation of the requirements under RCRA.  Most states take advantage of this authority, implementing their own hazardous waste programs that are at least as stringent, and in some cases are more stringent than the federal program.\nThe  provides several tools for mapping hazardous wastes to particular locations. These tools also allow the user to view additional information.\n are a special category of hazardous wastes that (in the U.S.):\nSome of the most common \"universal wastes\" are: , some specialty  (e.g. lithium or lead containing batteries), , and mercury-containing devices.\nUniversal wastes are subject to somewhat less stringent regulatory requirements. Small quantity generators of universal wastes may be classified as \"conditionally exempt small quantity generators\" (CESQGs) which release them from some of the regulatory requirements for the handling and storage hazardous wastes.\nUniversal wastes must still be disposed of properly.  (For more information, see )\nHousehold Hazardous Waste (HHW), also referred to as domestic hazardous waste or home generated special materials, is a waste that is generated from residential households. HHW only applies to waste coming from the use of materials that are labeled for and sold for \"home use\".  Waste generated by a company or at an industrial setting is not HHW.\nThe following list includes categories often applied to HHW.  It is important to note that many of these categories overlap and that many household wastes can fall into multiple categories:\nHistorically, some hazardous wastes were disposed of in regular . This resulted in unfavorable amounts of hazardous materials seeping into the ground. These chemicals eventually entered to natural  systems. Many landfills now require countermeasures against groundwater contamination. For example, a barrier has to be installed along the foundation of the landfill to contain the hazardous substances that may remain in the disposed waste. Currently, hazardous wastes must often be stabilized and solidified in order to enter a landfill and must undergo different treatments in order to stabilize and dispose of them. Most flammable materials can be recycled into industrial fuel. Some materials with hazardous constituents can be recycled, such as lead acid batteries.\nSome hazardous wastes can be recycled into new products. Examples may include  or . When  in these types of ashes go through the proper treatment, they could bind to other pollutants and convert them into easier-to-dispose solids, or they could be used as pavement filling. Such treatments reduce the level of threat of harmful chemicals, like fly and , while also recycling the safe product. There is a recycling center facility in . The city does not charge for any hazardous materials being disposed of, but there is a limit to how much you can bring per month. Other than hazardous waste, the city also allows you to dispose of electronic waste, light-bulbs, and batteries.\nAnother commonly used treatment is cement-based . Cement is used because it can treat a range of hazardous wastes by improving physical characteristics and decreasing the toxicity and transmission of contaminants. The cement produced is categorized into 5 different divisions, depending on its strength and  components. This process of converting sludge into cement might include the addition of pH adjustment agents, phosphates, or sulfur reagents to reduce the settling or curing time, increase the compressive strength, or reduce the leach ability of contaminants.\nHazardous waste may be \"destroyed\". For example, by  them at a high temperature, flammable wastes can sometimes be burned as energy sources. For example, many  burn hazardous wastes like used oils or solvents. Today, incineration treatments not only reduce the amount of hazardous waste, but also generate energy from the gases released in the process. It is known that this particular waste treatment releases toxic gases produced by the combustion of byproduct or other materials which can affect the environment. However, current technology has developed more efficient incinerator units that control these emissions to a point where this treatment is considered a more beneficial option.  There are different types of incinerators which vary depending on the characteristics of the waste. Starved air incineration is another method used to treat hazardous wastes. Just like in common incineration, burning occurs, however controlling the amount of oxygen allowed proves to be significant to reduce the amount of harmful byproducts produced. Starved air incineration is an improvement of the traditional incinerators in terms of air pollution. Using this technology, it is possible to control the combustion rate of the waste and therefore reduce the air pollutants produced in the process.\nHazardous waste may be sequestered in an hazardous waste landfill  or permanent disposal facility. \"In terms of hazardous waste, a landfill is defined as a disposal facility or part of a facility where hazardous waste is placed or on land and which is not a pile, a land treatment facility, a surface impoundment, an underground injection well, a salt dome formation, a salt bed formation, an underground mine, a cave, or a corrective action management unit (40 CFR 260.10).\"\nSome hazardous waste types may be eliminated using  in a high temperature not necessarily through electrical arc but starved of oxygen to avoid combustion.  However, when electrical arc is used to generate the required ultra heat (in excess of 3000 degree C temperature) all materials (waste) introduced into the process will melt into a molten slag and this technology is termed Plasma not pyrolysis. Plasma technology produces inert materials and when cooled solidifies into rock like material. These treatment methods are very expensive but may be preferable to high temperature incineration in some circumstances such as in the destruction of concentrated organic waste types, including PCBs, pesticides and other persistent organic pollutants.\n"},

Its woody components do not decompose quickly, so they provide the bulk that is necessary for supplementary topsoils. Mixing industrial wastes such as  or  with green waste to create artificial topsoil not only facilitates the  of industrial debris and keeps it out of landfills, but it also allows the nutrients in green waste materials to be cycled back into the environment. By utilizing fly ash in conjunction with green waste, manufactured soils are able to increase their water holding capacity while simultaneously recycling refuse materials that might otherwise take up space in a landfill. This allows fly ash and green waste to increase local soil nutrient levels and promotes natural nutrient cycling processes.\nGreen waste can also be mixed with  and composted, providing a safe, environmentally sustainable option for sewage disposal. Co-composting green and sewage wastes eliminates the risk that  and  contained in sewage wastes might pose to the environment. Utilization of green waste to dispose of sewage wastes not only decreases the amount of sewage  and dumped each year, it also facilitates the cycling of organic wastes back into the environment.

A material is considered toxic when it causes death or harm by being inhaled, swallowed, or absorbed through the skin.\nThe waste can , , radiation, dangerous pathogens, or other toxins. Even households generate  from items such as batteries, , and leftover paints or pesticides. Toxic material can be either human-made and others are naturally occurring in the environment. Not all hazardous substances are considered toxic.\nThe  (UNEP) has identified 11 key substances that pose a risk to human health:\nThe most overlooked toxic and hazardous wastes are the  products in everyday homes that are improperly disposed of such as old batteries, pesticides, paint, and car oil. Toxic waste can be reactive, ignitable, and corrosive. In the United States, these wastes are regulated under the  (RCRA).\nWith the increase of worldwide technology, there are more substances that are being considered toxic and harmful to human health. Some of this technology includes cell phones and computers. Such items have been given the name  or EEE, which stands for Electrical and Electronic Equipment. This term is also used for goods such as refrigerators, toys, and washing machines. These items can contain toxic components that can break down into water systems when discarded. The reduction in the cost of these goods has allowed for these items to be distributed globally without thought or consideration to managing the goods once they become ineffective or broken.\nIn the US, the  (EPA) and state environmental agencies develop and enforce regulations on the storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous waste. The EPA requires that toxic waste be handled with special precautions and be disposed of in designated facilities around the country. Also, many US cities have collection days where household toxic waste is gathered. Some materials that may not be accepted at regular landfills are ammunition, commercially generated waste, explosives/shock sensitive items, hypodermic needles/syringes, , radioactive materials, and smoke detectors.\nToxic wastes often contain , and exposure to these by some route, such as leakage or evaporation from the storage, causes cancer to appear at increased frequency in exposed individuals. For example, a  of the rare blood cancer  was found around a toxic waste dump site in northeast Pennsylvania in 2008.\nThe Human & Ecological Risk Assessment Journal conducted a study which focused on the health of individuals living near municipal landfills to see if it would be as harmful as living near hazardous landfills. They conducted a 7-year study that specifically tested for 18 types of cancers to see if the participants had higher rates than those that don't live around landfills. They conducted this study in western Massachusetts within a 1-mile radius of the North Hampton Regional Landfill.\nPeople encounter these toxins buried in the , in stream runoff, in  that supplies drinking water, or in floodwaters, as happened after Hurricane Katrina.

Toxic Waste.\" National Geographic. National Geographic, 2010. Web. 26 Apr 2010.\nOne of the biggest problems with today's toxic material is how to dispose of it properly. Before the passage of modern environmental laws (in the US, this was in the 1970s), it was legal to dump such wastes into streams, rivers and oceans, or bury it underground in . The US , enacted in 1972, and RCRA, enacted in 1976, created nationwide programs to regulate the handling and disposal of hazardous wastes.\nThe agriculture industry uses over 800,000 tons of pesticides worldwide annually that contaminates soils, and eventually infiltrates into groundwater, which can contaminate drinking water supplies. The oceans can be polluted from the  of these chemicals as well. Toxic waste in the form of petroleum oil can either spill into the oceans from pipe leaks or large ships, but it can also enter the oceans from everyday citizens dumping car oil into the rainstorm sewer systems. Disposal is the placement of waste into or on the land. Disposal facilities are usually designed to permanently contain the waste and prevent the release of harmful pollutants to the environment.\nThe most common hazardous waste disposal practice is placement in a land disposal unit such as a landfill, surface impoundment, waste pile, land treatment unit, or injection well. Land disposal is subject to requirements under EPA's Land Disposal Restrictions Program. Injection wells are regulated under the federal  program.\nOrganic wastes can be destroyed by  at high temperatures. However, if the waste contains  or , these must be separated and stored, as they cannot be destroyed. The method of storage will seek to immobilize the toxic components of the waste, possibly through storage in sealed containers, inclusion in a stable medium such as glass or a cement mixture, or burial under an impermeable clay cap. Waste transporters and waste facilities may charge fees; consequently, improper methods of disposal may be used to avoid paying these fees. Where the handling of toxic waste is regulated, the improper disposal of toxic waste may be punishable by fines or prison terms. Burial sites for toxic waste and other contaminated  may eventually be used as  or redeveloped for commercial or industrial use.\nThe  governs the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous waste. The  (TSCA), also enacted in 1976, authorizes the EPA to collect information on all new and existing chemical substances, as well as to control any substances that were determined to cause unreasonable risk to public health or the environment. The  law, passed in 1980, created a cleanup program for abandoned or uncontrolled hazardous waste sites.\nThere has been a long ongoing battle between communities and environmentalists versus governments and corporations about how strictly and how fairly the regulations and laws are written and enforced. That battle began in North Carolina in the late summer of 1979, as EPA's TSCA regulations were being implemented. In North Carolina, -contaminated oil was deliberately dripped along rural Piedmont highways, creating the largest PCB spills in American history and a public health crisis that would have repercussions for generations to come. The PCB-contaminated material was eventually collected and buried in a , but citizens' opposition, including large public demonstrations, exposed the dangers of toxic waste, the fallibility of landfills then in use, and EPA regulations allowing landfills to be built on marginal, but politically acceptable sites.\nWarren County citizens argued that the toxic waste landfill regulations were based on the fundamental assumption that the  EPA's conceptual dry-tomb landfill would contain the toxic waste. This assumption informed the siting of toxic waste landfills and waivers to regulations that were included in EPA's . For example, in 1978, the base of a major toxic waste landfill could be no closer than  five feet from , but this regulation and others could be waived. The waiver to the regulation concerning the distance between the base of a toxic waste landfill and groundwater allowed the base to be only a foot above ground water if the owner/operator of the facility could demonstrate to the EPA regional administrator that a  collection system could be installed and that there would be no hydraulic connection between the base of the landfill and groundwater. Citizens argued that the waivers to the siting regulations were discriminatory mechanisms facilitating the shift from scientific to political considerations concerning the siting decision and that in the South this would mean a discriminatory proliferation of dangerous waste management facilities in poor black and other minority communities. They also argued that the scientific consensus was that permanent containment could not be assured. As resistance to the siting of the PCB landfill in Warren County continued and studies revealed that EPA dry-tomb landfills were failing, EPA stated in its  that all landfills would eventually leak and should only be used as a stopgap measure.\nYears of research and empirical knowledge of the failures of the  Warren County PCB landfill led citizens of Warren County to  conclude  that the EPA's dry-tomb landfill design and regulations governing the disposal of toxic and hazardous waste were not based on sound science and adequate technology. Warren County's citizens concluded also that North Carolina's  was scientifically and constitutionally unacceptable because it authorized the siting of toxic, hazardous and nuclear waste facilities prior to public hearings, preempted local authority over the siting of the facilities, and authorized the use of force if needed.\nIn the aftermath of the Warren County protests, the 1984 Federal Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act focused on waste minimization and phasing out land disposal of hazardous waste as well as corrective action for releases of hazardous materials. Other measures included in the 1984 amendments included increased enforcement authority for EPA, more stringent hazardous waste management standards, and a comprehensive underground storage tank program.\nThe disposal of toxic waste continues to be a source of conflict in the U.S. Due to the hazards associated with toxic waste handling and disposal, communities often resist the siting of toxic waste landfills and other waste management facilities; however, determining where and how to dispose of waste is a necessary part of economic and environmental policy-making.\nThe issue of handling toxic waste has become a global problem as international trade has arisen out of the increasing toxic byproducts produced with the transfer of them to less developed countries. In 1995, the  began to notice the illicit dumping of toxic waste and assigned a  to examine the human rights aspect to this issue (Commission resolution 1995/81). In September 2011, the Human Rights Council decided to strengthen the mandate to include the entire life-cycle of hazardous products from manufacturing to final destination (aka ), as opposed to only movement and dumping of hazardous waste. The title of the Special Rapporteur has been changed to the \u201cSpecial Rapporteur on the implications for human rights of the environmentally sound management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes.\"(Human Rights Council 18/11). The Human Rights Council has further extended the scope of its mandates as of September 2012 due to the result of the dangerous implications occurring to persons advocating environmentally sound practices regarding the generation,management, handling, distribution and final disposal of hazardous and toxic materials to include the issue of the protection of the environmental human rights defenders.\n was a  (GIS) from the Division of Specialized Information Services of the  (NLM) that used maps of the United States to help users visually explore data from the 's (EPA)   and  programs.

Industries generating radioactive waste include , , , manufacturing, construction, coal and  and  reprocessing. Radioactive waste is regulated by government agencies in order to protect human health and the environment.\nIn modern nuclear plants over 96% of  is recycled back into uranium-based and . Radioactivity of the remaining 4%  naturally decreases over time, so it has to be isolated and confined in appropriate disposal facilities for a sufficient period until it no longer poses a threat. The time radioactive waste must be stored for depends on the type of waste and radioactive isotopes. Current approaches to radioactive waste storage have been segregation and storage for short-lived waste, near-surface disposal for low and some intermediate-level waste, and burial in a  or  for the high-level waste. \nA summary of the amounts of radioactive waste and management approaches for most developed countries are presented and reviewed periodically as part of the  (IAEA) . \nRadioactive waste typically comprises a number of : unstable configurations of elements that , emitting  which is harmful to humans and the environment. These isotopes emit different types and levels of radiation, which last for different periods of time.\nThe radioactivity of all radioactive waste weakens with time. All  contained in the waste have a  \u2014 the time it takes for half of the atoms to decay into another  \u2014 and eventually, all radioactive waste decays into non-radioactive elements (i.e., ). Since radioactive decay follows the half-life rule, the rate of decay is inversely proportional to the duration of decay. In other words, the radiation from a long-lived isotope like  will be much less intense than that of a short-lived isotope like . The two tables show some of the major radioisotopes, their half-lives, and their  as a proportion of the yield of fission of uranium-235.\nThe energy and the type of the  emitted by a radioactive substance are also important factors in determining its threat to humans. The chemical properties of the radioactive  will determine how mobile the substance is and how likely it is to spread into the environment and  humans. This is further complicated by the fact that many radioisotopes do not decay immediately to a stable state but rather to radioactive  within a  before ultimately reaching a stable state.\nNo fission products\nhave a half-life\nin the range of\n100\u2013210\u00a0k years ...\n... nor beyond 15.7\u00a0M years\n for superscript symbols\n\u20a1\u00a0 has thermal  cross section in the range of 8\u201350 barns\n\u0192\u00a0 \nm\u00a0 \n\u2116\u00a0 primarily a  (NORM)\n\u00fe\u00a0  (thermal neutron capture cross section greater than 3k barns)\n\u2020\u00a0 range 4\u201397\u00a0y: \n\u2021\u00a0 over 200,000\u00a0y: \nExposure to radioactive waste may cause health impacts due to ionizing radiation exposure. In , a dose of 1  carries a 5.5% risk of developing cancer, and regulatory agencies  even for low doses. Ionizing radiation can cause deletions in chromosomes. If a developing organism such as a  is irradiated, it is possible a  may be induced, but it is unlikely this defect will be in a  or a gamete-forming . The incidence of radiation-induced mutations in humans is small, as in most mammals, because of natural cellular-repair mechanisms, many just now coming to light. These mechanisms range from DNA,  and protein repair, to internal lysosomic digestion of defective proteins, and even induced cell suicide\u2014apoptosis\nDepending on the decay mode and the   (how the body processes it and how quickly), the threat due to exposure to a given activity of a  will differ. For instance  is a short-lived  and  emitter, but because it concentrates in the  gland, it is more able to cause injury than -137 which, being , is rapidly excreted through urine. In a similar way, the  emitting actinides and  are considered very harmful as they tend to have long  and their radiation has a high , making it far more damaging to tissues per amount of energy deposited. Because of such differences, the rules determining biological injury differ widely according to the radioisotope, time of exposure\nand sometimes also the nature of the chemical compound which contains the radioisotope.\nRadioactive waste comes from a number of sources. In countries with nuclear power plants, nuclear armament, or nuclear fuel treatment plants, the majority of waste originates from the nuclear fuel cycle and nuclear weapons reprocessing. Other sources include medical and industrial wastes, as well as naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM) that can be concentrated as a result of the processing or consumption of coal, oil and gas, and some minerals, as discussed below.\nWaste from the front end of the  is usually alpha-emitting waste from the extraction of uranium. It often contains radium and its decay products.\n (UO) concentrate from mining is a thousand or so times as radioactive as the  used in buildings. It is refined from  (UO), then converted to  gas (UF). As a gas, it undergoes  to increase the  content from 0.7% to about 4.4% (LEU). It is then turned into a hard  oxide (UO) for assembly as reactor fuel elements.\nThe main by-product of enrichment is  (DU), principally the  isotope, with a U-235 content of ~0.3%. It is stored, either as UF or as UO. Some is used in applications where its extremely high density makes it valuable such as  , and on at least  even a sailboat . It is also used with plutonium for making  (MOX) and to dilute, or , highly enriched uranium from weapons stockpiles which is now being redirected to become reactor fuel.\nThe back-end of the nuclear fuel cycle, mostly spent , contains  that emit beta and gamma radiation, and  that emit , such as  (half-life 245\u00a0thousand years),  (2.144\u00a0million years),  (87.7\u00a0years) and  (432 years), and even sometimes some neutron emitters such as  (half-life of 898 years for Cf-251). These isotopes are formed in .\nIt is important to distinguish the processing of uranium to make fuel from the  of used fuel. Used fuel contains the highly radioactive products of fission (see high level waste below). Many of these are neutron absorbers, called  in this context. These eventually build up to a level where they absorb so many neutrons that the chain reaction stops, even with the control rods completely removed. At that point the fuel has to be replaced in the reactor with fresh fuel, even though there is still a substantial quantity of  and  present. In the United States, this used fuel is usually \"stored\", while in other countries such as Russia, the United Kingdom, France, Japan and India, the fuel is reprocessed to remove the fission products, and the fuel can then be re-used. The fission products removed from the fuel are a concentrated form of high-level waste as are the chemicals used in the process. While these countries reprocess the fuel carrying out single plutonium cycles, India is the only country known to be planning multiple plutonium recycling schemes.\nThe use of different fuels in nuclear reactors results in different  (SNF) composition, with varying activity curves.\nLong-lived radioactive waste from the back end of the fuel cycle is especially relevant when designing a complete waste management plan for SNF. When looking at long-term , the actinides in the SNF have a significant influence due to their characteristically long half-lives. Depending on what a  is fueled with, the actinide composition in the SNF will be different.\nAn example of this effect is the use of  with . Th-232 is a fertile material that can undergo a neutron capture reaction and two beta minus decays, resulting in the production of fissile . The SNF of a cycle with thorium will contain U-233. Its radioactive decay will strongly influence the long-term  curve of the SNF around a million years. A comparison of the activity associated to U-233 for three different SNF types can be seen in the figure on the top right. The burnt fuels are thorium with reactor-grade plutonium (RGPu), thorium with weapons-grade plutonium (WGPu) and  (MOX, no thorium). For RGPu and WGPu, the initial amount of U-233 and its decay around a million years can be seen. This has an effect in the total activity curve of the three fuel types. The initial absence of U-233 and its daughter products in the MOX fuel results in a lower activity in region 3 of the figure on the bottom right, whereas for RGPu and WGPu the curve is maintained higher due to the presence of U-233 that has not fully decayed.  can remove the actinides from the spent fuel so they can be used or destroyed (see ).\nSince uranium and plutonium are  materials, there have been proliferation concerns. Ordinarily (in ), plutonium is . In addition to , which is highly suitable for building nuclear weapons, it contains large amounts of undesirable contaminants: , , and . These isotopes are extremely difficult to separate, and more cost-effective ways of obtaining fissile material exist (e.g., uranium enrichment or dedicated plutonium production reactors).\nHigh-level waste is full of highly radioactive , most of which are relatively short-lived. This is a concern since if the waste is stored, perhaps in , over many years the fission products decay, decreasing the radioactivity of the waste and making the plutonium easier to access. The undesirable contaminant Pu-240 decays faster than the Pu-239, and thus the quality of the bomb material increases with time (although its quantity decreases during that time as well). Thus, some have argued, as time passes, these deep storage areas have the potential to become \"plutonium mines\", from which material for nuclear weapons can be acquired with relatively little difficulty. Critics of the latter idea have pointed out the difficulty of recovering useful material from sealed deep storage areas makes other methods preferable. Specifically, the high radioactivity and heat (80\u00b0C in surrounding rock) greatly increases the difficulty of mining a storage area, and the enrichment methods required have high capital costs.\nPu-239 decays to  which is suitable for weapons and which has a very long half-life (roughly 10 years). Thus plutonium may decay and leave uranium-235. However, modern reactors are only moderately enriched with U-235 relative to U-238, so the U-238 continues to serve as a  agent for any U-235 produced by plutonium decay.\nOne solution to this problem is to recycle the plutonium and use it as a fuel e.g. in . In , the separated plutonium and uranium are contaminated by actinides and cannot be used for nuclear weapons.\nWaste from nuclear weapons decommissioning is unlikely to contain much beta or gamma activity other than  and . It is more likely to contain alpha-emitting actinides such as Pu-239 which is a fissile material used in bombs, plus some material with much higher specific activities, such as Pu-238 or Po.\nIn the past the neutron trigger for an  tended to be  and a high activity alpha emitter such as ; an alternative to polonium is . For reasons of national security, details of the design of modern bombs are normally not released to the open literature.\nSome designs might contain a  using Pu-238 to provide a long lasting source of electrical power for the electronics in the device.\nIt is likely that the fissile material of an old bomb which is due for refitting will contain decay products of the plutonium isotopes used in it, these are likely to include  from Pu-240 impurities, plus some U-235 from decay of the Pu-239; due to the relatively long half-life of these Pu isotopes, these wastes from radioactive decay of bomb core material would be very small, and in any case, far less dangerous (even in terms of simple radioactivity) than the Pu-239 itself.\nThe beta decay of  forms ; the in-growth of americium is likely to be a greater problem than the decay of Pu-239 and Pu-240 as the americium is a gamma emitter (increasing external-exposure to workers) and is an alpha emitter which can cause the generation of . The plutonium could be separated from the americium by several different processes; these would include  processes and aqueous/organic . A truncated  type extraction process would be one possible method of making the separation.\nNaturally occurring uranium is not fissile because it contains 99.3% of U-238 and only 0.7% of U-235.\nDue to historic activities typically related to radium industry, uranium mining, and military programs, numerous sites contain or are contaminated with radioactivity. In the United States alone, the  states there are \"millions of gallons of radioactive waste\" as well as \"thousands of tons of  and material\" and also \"huge quantities of contaminated soil and water.\" Despite copious quantities of waste, the DOE has stated a goal of cleaning all presently contaminated sites successfully by 2025. The ,  site for example had \"31 million pounds of uranium product\", \"2.5 billion pounds of waste\", \"2.75 million cubic yards of contaminated soil and debris\", and a \"223 acre portion of the underlying Great Miami Aquifer had uranium levels above drinking standards.\" The United States has at least 108 sites designated as areas that are contaminated and unusable, sometimes many thousands of acres. DOE wishes to clean or mitigate many or all by 2025, using the recently developed method of , however the task can be difficult and it acknowledges that some may never be completely remediated. In just one of these 108 larger designations, , there were for example at least \"167 known contaminant release sites\" in one of the three subdivisions of the 37,000-acre (150\u00a0km) site. Some of the U.S. sites were smaller in nature, however, cleanup issues were simpler to address, and DOE has successfully completed cleanup, or at least closure, of several sites.\nRadioactive  tends to contain  and  emitters. It can be divided into two main classes. In diagnostic  a number of short-lived gamma emitters such as  are used. Many of these can be disposed of by leaving it to decay for a short time before disposal as normal waste. Other isotopes used in medicine, with half-lives in parentheses, include:\n source waste can contain , ,  or gamma emitters. Gamma emitters are used in  while neutron emitting sources are used in a range of applications, such as  logging.\nSubstances containing natural radioactivity are known as  (Naturally occurring radioactive material). After human processing that exposes or concentrates this natural radioactivity (such as mining bringing coal to the surface or burning it to produce concentrated ash), it becomes technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive material (TENORM). A lot of this waste is -emitting matter from the decay chains of  and . The main source of radiation in the human body is -40 (), typically 17 milligrams in the body at a time and 0.4 milligrams/day intake. Most rocks, especially , have a low level of radioactivity due to the potassium-40, thorium and uranium contained.\nUsually ranging from 1  (mSv) to 13\u00a0mSv annually depending on location, average radiation exposure from natural radioisotopes is 2.0\u00a0mSv per person a year worldwide. This makes up the majority of typical total dosage (with mean annual exposure from other sources amounting to 0.6\u00a0mSv from medical tests averaged over the whole populace, 0.4\u00a0mSv from , 0.005\u00a0mSv from the legacy of past atmospheric nuclear testing, 0.005\u00a0mSv occupational exposure, 0.002\u00a0mSv from the , and 0.0002\u00a0mSv from the nuclear fuel cycle).\nTENORM is not regulated as restrictively as nuclear reactor waste, though there are no significant differences in the radiological risks of these materials.\n contains a small amount of radioactive uranium, barium, thorium and potassium, but, in the case of pure coal, this is significantly less than the average concentration of those elements in the . The surrounding strata, if shale or mudstone, often contain slightly more than average and this may also be reflected in the ash content of 'dirty' coals. The more active ash minerals become concentrated in the  precisely because they do not burn well. The radioactivity of fly ash is about the same as black  and is less than  rocks, but is more of a concern because a small amount of the fly ash ends up in the atmosphere where it can be inhaled. According to U.S.  reports, population exposure from 1000-MWe power plants amounts to 490  for coal power plants, 100 times as great as nuclear power plants (4.8 person-rem/year). (The exposure from the complete nuclear fuel cycle from mining to waste disposal is 136 person-rem/year; the corresponding value for coal use from mining to waste disposal is \"probably unknown\".)\nResidues from the  often contain radium and its decay products. The sulfate scale from an oil well can be very radium rich, while the water, oil and gas from a well often contain . The radon decays to form solid radioisotopes which form coatings on the inside of pipework. In an oil processing plant the area of the plant where  is processed is often one of the more contaminated areas of the plant as radon has a similar boiling point to propane.\nRadioactive elements are an industrial problem in some oil wells where workers operating in direct contact with the crude oil and  can be actually exposed to doses having negative health effects. Due to relatively high concentration of these elements in the brine, its disposal is also technological challenge. In the USA the brine is however exempt from the dangerous waste regulations and can be disposed of regardless of radioactive or toxic substances content sine 80's.\nDue to natural occurrence of radioactive elements such as  and  in , mining operations also result in production of waste and mineral deposits that are slightly radioactive. \nClassifications of radioactive waste varies by country. The IAEA, which publishes the Radioactive Waste Safety Standards (RADWASS), also plays a significant role. The proportion of various types of waste generated in the UK:\n\nUranium tailings are waste by-product materials left over from the rough processing of -bearing . They are not significantly radioactive. Mill tailings are sometimes referred to as , from the section of the  that defines them. Uranium mill tailings typically also contain   such as  and . Vast mounds of uranium mill tailings are left at many old mining sites, especially in , , and .\nAlthough mill tailings are not very radioactive, they have long half-lives. Mill tailings often contain radium, thorium and trace amounts of uranium.\nLow level waste (LLW) is generated from hospitals and industry, as well as the . Low-level wastes include , rags, , , filters, and other materials which contain small amounts of mostly short-lived radioactivity. Materials that originate from any region of an Active Area are commonly designated as LLW as a precautionary measure even if there is only a remote possibility of being contaminated with radioactive materials. Such LLW typically exhibits no higher radioactivity than one would expect from the same material disposed of in a non-active area, such as a normal office block. Example LLW includes wiping rags, mops, medical tubes, laboratory animal carcasses, and more. LLW waste makes 94% of all radioactive waste volume in the UK.\nSome high-activity LLW requires shielding during handling and transport but most LLW is suitable for shallow land burial. To reduce its volume, it is often compacted or incinerated before disposal. Low-level waste is divided into four classes: , , , and  ().\nIntermediate-level waste (ILW) contains higher amounts of radioactivity compared to low-level waste. \nIt generally requires shielding, but not cooling. \nIntermediate-level wastes includes ,  and metal  cladding, as well as contaminated materials from . It may be solidified in  or  or mixed with silica sand and  for disposal. As a general rule, short-lived waste (mainly non-fuel materials from reactors) is buried in shallow repositories, while long-lived waste (from fuel and ) is deposited in . U.S. regulations do not define this category of waste; the term is used in Europe and elsewhere. ILW makes ca 6% of all radioactive waste volume in the UK.\nHigh-level waste (HLW) is produced by nuclear reactors. The exact definition of HLW differs internationally. After a nuclear fuel rod serves one fuel cycle and is removed from the core, it is considered HLW. Fuel rods contain  and  generated in the . Spent fuel is highly radioactive and often hot. HLW accounts for over 95% of the total radioactivity produced in the process of nuclear  but it contributes to less than 1% of volume of all radioactive waste produced in the UK. Overall, 60-years long nuclear program in the UK  up until 2019 produced 2150 m of HLW. \nThe radioactive waste from spent fuel rods consist primarily of cesium-137 and strontium-90, but it may also include plutonium, which can be considered a transuranic waste. The half-lives of these radioactive elements can differ quite extremely. Some elements, such as cesium-137 and strontium-90 have half-lives of approximately 30 years. Meanwhile, plutonium has a half-life of that can stretch to as long as 24,000 years.\nThe amount of HLW worldwide is currently increasing by about 12,000  every year. \nA 1000- nuclear power plant produces about 27 tonnes of spent nuclear fuel (unreprocessed) every year. For comparison, the amount of ash produced by coal power plants in the US alone is estimated at 130'000'000 metric tons per year and fly ash is estimated to release 100x more radiation than an equivalent nuclear power plant. \nIn 2010, it was estimated that about 250,000 tons of nuclear HLW were stored globally. \nThis does not include amounts that have escaped into the environment from accidents or tests. \n is estimated to hold 17,000 tons of HLW in storage in 2015. \nAs of 2019, the  has over 90,000 tons of HLW. \nHLW have been shipped to other countries to be stored or reprocessed, and in some cases, shipped back as active fuel.\nThe ongoing controversy over  is a major constraint on the nuclear power's global expansion. \nMost scientists agree that the main proposed long-term solution is deep geological burial, either in a mine or a deep borehole.\nAs of 2019 no dedicated civilian high-level nuclear waste is operational as small amounts of HLW did not justify the investment before. Finland is in the advanced stage of the construction the  planned to open in 2025 at 400-450 m depth.  France is in the planning phase for 500 m deep Cigeo facility in Bure. Sweden plans a site in . Canada plans 680 m deep facility near Lake Huron in Ontario. Republic of Korea plans to open a site around 2028. The site in Sweden enjoys 80% support from local residents as of 2020.\nThe  is currently the only  high-level radioactive waste storage site in the United States.\nTransuranic waste (TRUW) as defined by U.S. regulations is, without regard to form or origin, waste that is contaminated with -emitting transuranic  with  greater than 20 years and concentrations greater than 100\u00a0/g (3.7\u00a0/kg), excluding high-level waste. Elements that have an atomic number greater than uranium are called transuranic (\"beyond uranium\"). Because of their long half-lives, TRUW is disposed more cautiously than either low- or intermediate-level waste. In the U.S., it arises mainly from  production, and consists of clothing, tools, rags, residues, debris and other items contaminated with small amounts of radioactive elements (mainly ).\nUnder U.S. law, transuranic waste is further categorized into \"contact-handled\" (CH) and \"remote-handled\" (RH) on the basis of the radiation dose rate measured at the surface of the waste container. CH TRUW has a surface dose rate not greater than 200  per hour (2\u00a0mSv/h), whereas RH TRUW has a surface dose rate of 200\u00a0mrem/h (2\u00a0mSv/h) or greater. CH TRUW does not have the very high radioactivity of high-level waste, nor its high heat generation, but RH TRUW can be highly radioactive, with surface dose rates up to 1,000,000 \u00a0mrem/h (10,000\u00a0mSv/h). The U.S. currently disposes of TRUW generated from military facilities at the  (WIPP) in a deep salt formation in .\nA future way to reduce waste accumulation is to phase out current reactors in favor of , which output less waste per power generated.  such as  in Russia are also able to consume  fuel that is manufactured from recycled spent fuel from traditional reactors.\nThe UK's  published a position paper in 2014 on the progress on approaches to the management of separated plutonium, which summarises the conclusions of the work that NDA shared with UK government.\n\nOf particular concern in nuclear waste management are two long-lived fission products, Tc-99 (half-life 220,000 years) and I-129 (half-life 15.7 million years), which dominate spent fuel radioactivity after a few thousand years. The most troublesome transuranic elements in spent fuel are Np-237 (half-life two million years) and Pu-239 (half-life 24,000 years). Nuclear waste requires sophisticated treatment and management to successfully isolate it from interacting with the . This usually necessitates treatment, followed by a long-term management strategy involving storage, disposal or transformation of the waste into a non-toxic form. Governments around the world are considering a range of waste management and disposal options, though there has been limited progress toward long-term waste management solutions.\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, several methods of disposal of radioactive waste were investigated by nuclear nations, which are\u00a0:\nIn the US, waste management policy completely broke down with the ending of work on the incomplete . At present there are 70 nuclear power plant sites where  is stored. A Blue Ribbon Commission was appointed by President Obama to look into future options for this and future waste. A  seems to be favored.  2018 -winner , has proposed using  to generate high-energy and low-duration laser pulses to transmute highly radioactive material (contained in a target) to significantly reduce its half-life, from thousands of years to only a few minutes.\nLong-term storage of radioactive waste requires the stabilization of the waste into a form which will neither react nor degrade for extended periods. It is theorized that one way to do this might be through . Currently at  the high-level waste ( first cycle ) is mixed with  and then calcined.  involves passing the waste through a heated, rotating tube. The purposes of calcination are to evaporate the water from the waste, and de-nitrate the fission products to assist the stability of the glass produced.\nThe 'calcine' generated is fed continuously into an induction heated furnace with fragmented . The resulting glass is a new substance in which the waste products are bonded into the glass matrix when it solidifies. As a melt, this product is poured into  cylindrical containers (\"cylinders\") in a batch process. When cooled, the fluid solidifies (\"vitrifies\") into the glass. After being formed, the glass is highly resistant to water.\nAfter filling a cylinder, a seal is  onto the cylinder head. The cylinder is then washed. After being inspected for external contamination, the steel cylinder is stored, usually in an underground repository. In this form, the waste products are expected to be immobilized for thousands of years.\nThe glass inside a cylinder is usually a black glossy substance. All this work (in the United Kingdom) is done using  systems. Sugar is added to control the  chemistry and to stop the formation of the volatile  containing . In the West, the glass is normally a  (similar to ), while in the former  it is normal to use a . The amount of fission products in the glass must be limited because some (, the other Pt group metals, and ) tend to form metallic phases which separate from the glass. Bulk vitrification uses electrodes to melt soil and wastes, which are then buried underground. In Germany a vitrification plant is in use; this is treating the waste from a small demonstration reprocessing plant which has since been closed down.\nVitrification is not the only way to stabilize the waste into a form that will not react or degrade for extended periods. Immobilization via direct incorporation into a phosphate based crystalline ceramic host is also used. The diverse chemistry of phosphate ceramics under various conditions demonstrate a versatile material that can withstand chemical, thermal and radioactive degradation over time. The properties of phosphates, particularly ceramic phosphates, of stability over a wide pH range, low porosity and minimization of secondary waste introduces possibilities for new waste immobilization techniques.\nIt is common for medium active wastes in the nuclear industry to be treated with  or other means to concentrate the radioactivity into a small volume. The much less radioactive bulk (after treatment) is often then discharged. For instance, it is possible to use a    to remove radioactive metals from aqueous mixtures. After the radioisotopes are absorbed onto the ferric hydroxide, the resulting sludge can be placed in a metal drum before being mixed with cement to form a solid waste form. In order to get better long-term performance (mechanical stability) from such forms, they may be made from a mixture of , or  , and , instead of normal  (made with Portland cement, gravel and sand).\nThe Australian  (synthetic rock) is a more sophisticated way to immobilize such waste, and this process may eventually come into commercial use for civil wastes (it is currently being developed for US military wastes). Synroc was invented by Prof Ted Ringwood (a ) at the . The Synroc contains  and cryptomelane type minerals. The original form of Synroc (Synroc C) was designed for the liquid high level waste (PUREX raffinate) from a . The main minerals in this Synroc are hollandite (BaAlTiO),  (CaZrTiO) and  (CaTiO). The zirconolite and perovskite are hosts for the . The  and  will be fixed in the perovskite. The  will be fixed in the hollandite.\nThe time frame in question when dealing with radioactive waste ranges from 10,000 to 1,000,000 years, according to studies based on the effect of estimated radiation doses.\nResearchers suggest that forecasts of health detriment for such periods should be examined critically.\n Practical studies only consider up to 100 years as far as effective planning and cost evaluations are concerned. Long term behavior of radioactive wastes remains a subject for ongoing research projects in .\n typically involves taking waste from a  and sealing it (along with an ) in a  cylinder, which is placed in a  cylinder which acts as a radiation shield. It is a relatively inexpensive method which can be done at a central facility or adjacent to the source reactor. The waste can be easily retrieved for reprocessing.\nThe process of selecting appropriate  for high level waste and spent fuel is now under way in several countries with the first expected to be commissioned some time after 2010. The basic concept is to locate a large, stable geologic formation and use mining technology to excavate a tunnel, or large-bore  (similar to those used to drill the  from England to France) to drill a shaft 500 metres (1,600\u00a0ft) to 1,000 metres (3,300\u00a0ft) below the surface where rooms or vaults can be excavated for disposal of high-level radioactive waste. The goal is to permanently isolate nuclear waste from the human environment. Many people remain uncomfortable with the immediate  of this disposal system, suggesting perpetual management and monitoring would be more prudent.\nBecause some radioactive species have half-lives longer than one million years, even very low container leakage and radionuclide migration rates must be taken into account. Moreover, it may require more than one half-life until some nuclear materials lose enough radioactivity to cease being lethal to living things. A 1983 review of the Swedish radioactive waste disposal program by the National Academy of Sciences found that country's estimate of several hundred thousand years\u2014perhaps up to one million years\u2014being necessary for waste isolation \"fully justified.\"\n of radioactive waste has been suggested by the finding that deep waters in the North Atlantic Ocean do not present an exchange with shallow waters for about 140 years based on oxygen content data recorded over a period of 25 years. They include burial beneath a stable , burial in a  zone that would slowly carry the waste downward into the , and burial beneath a remote natural or human-made island. While these approaches all have merit and would facilitate an international solution to the problem of disposal of radioactive waste, they would require an amendment of the .\nArticle 1 (Definitions), 7., of the 1996 Protocol to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, (the London Dumping Convention) states:\nThe proposed land-based subductive waste disposal method disposes of nuclear waste in a  zone accessed from land and therefore is not prohibited by international agreement. This method has been described as the most viable means of disposing of radioactive waste, and as the state-of-the-art as of 2001 in nuclear waste disposal technology.\nAnother approach termed Remix & Return would blend high-level waste with  and mill tailings down to the level of the original radioactivity of the , then replace it in inactive uranium mines. This approach has the merits of providing jobs for miners who would double as disposal staff, and of facilitating a cradle-to-grave cycle for radioactive materials, but would be inappropriate for spent reactor fuel in the absence of reprocessing, due to the presence of highly toxic radioactive elements such as plutonium within it.\n is the concept of disposing of high-level radioactive waste from nuclear reactors in extremely deep boreholes. Deep borehole disposal seeks to place the waste as much as 5 kilometres (3.1\u00a0mi) beneath the surface of the Earth and relies primarily on the immense natural geological barrier to confine the waste safely and permanently so that it should never pose a threat to the environment. The Earth's crust contains 120 trillion tons of thorium and 40 trillion tons of uranium (primarily at relatively trace concentrations of parts per million each adding up over the crust's 3 * 10 ton mass), among other natural radioisotopes. Since the fraction of nuclides decaying per unit of time is inversely proportional to an isotope's half-life, the relative radioactivity of the lesser amount of human-produced radioisotopes (thousands of tons instead of trillions of tons) would diminish once the isotopes with far shorter half-lives than the bulk of natural radioisotopes decayed.\nIn January 2013,   rejected UK central government proposals to start work on an underground storage dump for nuclear waste near to the . \"For any host community, there will be a substantial community benefits package and worth hundreds of millions of pounds\" said Ed Davey, Energy Secretary, but nonetheless, the local elected body voted 7\u20133 against research continuing, after hearing evidence from independent geologists that \"the fractured strata of the county was impossible to entrust with such dangerous material and a hazard lasting millennia.\"\n describes proposals to drill over one kilometer vertically, and two kilometers horizontally in the earth\u2019s crust, for the purpose of disposing of high-level waste forms such as , , or . After the emplacement and the retrievability period, drillholes would be backfilled and sealed. A series of tests of the technology were carried out in November 2018 and then again publicly in January 2019 by a U.S. based private company. The test demonstrated the emplacement of a test-canister in a horizontal drillhole and retrieval of the same canister. There was no actual high-level waste used in this test.\nThere have been proposals for reactors that consume nuclear waste and transmute it to other, less-harmful or shorter-lived, nuclear waste. In particular, the  was a proposed nuclear reactor with a nuclear fuel cycle that produced no transuranic waste and in fact, could consume transuranic waste. It proceeded as far as large-scale tests, but was then canceled by the US Government. Another approach, considered safer but requiring more development, is to dedicate  to the  of the left-over transuranic elements.\nAn isotope that is found in nuclear waste and that represents a concern in terms of proliferation is Pu-239. The large stock of plutonium is a result of its production inside uranium-fueled reactors and of the reprocessing of weapons-grade plutonium during the weapons program. An option for getting rid of this plutonium is to use it as a fuel in a traditional Light Water Reactor (LWR). Several fuel types with differing plutonium destruction efficiencies are under study.\nTransmutation was banned in the US in April 1977 by President Carter due to the danger of plutonium proliferation, but President Reagan rescinded the ban in 1981. Due to the economic losses and risks, construction of reprocessing plants during this time did not resume. Due to high energy demand, work on the method has continued in the . This has resulted in a practical nuclear research reactor called  in which transmutation is possible. Additionally, a new research program called ACTINET has been started in the  to make transmutation possible on a large, industrial scale. According to President Bush's Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) of 2007, the US is now actively promoting research on transmutation technologies needed to markedly reduce the problem of nuclear waste treatment.\nThere have also been theoretical studies involving the use of  as so called \"actinide burners\" where a fusion reactor  such as in a , could be \"doped\" with a small amount of the \"minor\" transuranic atoms which would be transmuted (meaning fissioned in the actinide case) to lighter elements upon their successive bombardment by the very high energy neutrons produced by the fusion of  and  in the reactor. A study at  found that only 2 or 3 fusion reactors with parameters similar to that of the  (ITER) could transmute the entire annual  production from all of the  presently operating in the United States fleet while simultaneously generating approximately 1  of power from each reactor.\nAnother option is to find applications for the isotopes in nuclear waste so as to  them.\nAlready, ,  and a few other isotopes are extracted for certain industrial applications such as  and . While re-use does not eliminate the need to manage radioisotopes, it can reduce the quantity of waste produced.\nThe Nuclear Assisted Hydrocarbon Production Method, Canadian patent application 2,659,302, is a method for the temporary or permanent storage of nuclear waste materials comprising the placing of waste materials into one or more repositories or boreholes constructed into an  formation. The thermal flux of the waste materials fracture the formation and alters the chemical and/or physical properties of hydrocarbon material within the subterranean formation to allow removal of the altered material. A mixture of hydrocarbons, hydrogen, and/or other formation fluids is produced from the formation. The radioactivity of high-level radioactive waste affords proliferation resistance to plutonium placed in the periphery of the repository or the deepest portion of a borehole.\n can run on U-238 and transuranic elements, which comprise the majority of spent fuel radioactivity in the 1,000\u2013100,000-year time span.\nSpace disposal is attractive because it removes nuclear waste from the planet. It has significant disadvantages, such as the potential for catastrophic failure of a , which could spread radioactive material into the atmosphere and around the world. A high number of launches would be required because no individual rocket would be able to carry very much of the material relative to the total amount that needs to be disposed of. This makes the proposal impractical economically and it increases the risk of at least one or more launch failures.\nTo further complicate matters, international agreements on the regulation of such a program would need to be established.\nCosts and inadequate reliability of modern rocket launch systems for space disposal has been one of the motives for interest in  systems such as , , and other proposals.\nSweden and Finland are furthest along in committing to a particular disposal technology, while many others reprocess spent fuel or contract with France or Great Britain to do it, taking back the resulting plutonium and high-level waste. \"An increasing backlog of plutonium from reprocessing is developing in many countries... It is doubtful that reprocessing makes economic sense in the present environment of cheap uranium.\"\nIn many European countries (e.g., Britain, Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland) the risk or dose limit for a member of the public exposed to radiation from a future high-level nuclear waste facility is considerably more stringent than that suggested by the International Commission on Radiation Protection or proposed in the United States. European limits are often more stringent than the standard suggested in 1990 by the International Commission on Radiation Protection by a factor of 20, and more stringent by a factor of ten than the standard proposed by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for  for the first 10,000 years after closure.\nThe U.S. EPA's proposed standard for greater than 10,000 years is 250 times more permissive than the European limit. The U.S. EPA proposed a legal limit of a maximum of 3.5  (350 ) each annually to local individuals after 10,000 years, which would be up to several percent of the exposure currently received by some populations in the highest natural background regions on Earth, though the U.S.  predicted that . Over a timeframe of thousands of years, after the most active short half-life radioisotopes decayed, burying U.S. nuclear waste would increase the radioactivity in the top 2000 feet of rock and soil in the  (10 million km) by approximately 1 part in 10 million over the cumulative amount of  in such a volume, but the vicinity of the site would have a far higher concentration of artificial radioisotopes underground than such an average.\nAfter serious opposition had arisen about plans and negotiations between  with Japan and the United States of America to build nuclear-waste facilities in Mongolia, Mongolia stopped all negotiations in September 2011. These negotiations had started after U.S. Deputy Secretary of Energy  visited Mongolia in September, 2010. Talks took place in Washington, D.C. between officials of Japan, the United States and Mongolia in February 2011. After this the  (UAE), which wanted to buy nuclear fuel from Mongolia, joined in the negotiations. The talks were kept secret, and although The  reported on them in May, Mongolia officially denied the existence of these negotiations. However, alarmed by this news, Mongolian citizens protested against the plans, and demanded the government withdraw the plans and disclose information. The Mongolian President  issued a presidential order on September 13 banning all negotiations with foreign governments or international organizations on nuclear-waste storage plans in Mongolia. The Mongolian government has accused the newspaper of distributing false claims around the world. After the presidential order, the Mongolian president fired the individual who was supposedly involved in these conversations.\nAuthorities in Italy are investigating a  mafia clan accused of trafficking and illegally dumping nuclear waste. According to a , a manager of the Italy's state energy research agency  paid the clan to get rid of 600 drums of toxic and radioactive waste from Italy, Switzerland, France, Germany, and the US, with  as the destination, where the waste was buried after buying off local politicians. Former employees of Enea are suspected of paying the criminals to take waste off their hands in the 1980s and 1990s. Shipments to Somalia continued into the 1990s, while the 'Ndrangheta clan also blew up shiploads of waste, including radioactive hospital waste, sending them to the sea bed off the  coast. According to the environmental group , former members of the 'Ndrangheta have said that they were paid to sink ships with radioactive material for the last 20 years.\nA few incidents have occurred when radioactive material was disposed of improperly, shielding during transport was defective, or when it was simply abandoned or even stolen from a waste store. In the Soviet Union, waste stored in  was blown over the area during a  after the lake had partly dried out. At , a low-level radioactive waste facility located in , containment trenches covered with dirt, instead of steel or cement, collapsed under heavy rainfall into the trenches and filled with water. The water that invaded the trenches became radioactive and had to be disposed of at the Maxey Flat facility itself. In other cases of radioactive waste accidents, lakes or ponds with radioactive waste accidentally overflowed into the rivers during exceptional storms. In Italy, several radioactive waste deposits let material flow into river water, thus contaminating water for domestic use. In France, in the summer of 2008 numerous incidents happened; in one, at the Areva plant in , it was reported that during a draining operation, liquid containing untreated uranium overflowed out of a faulty tank and about 75\u00a0kg of the radioactive material seeped into the ground and, from there, into two rivers nearby; in another case, over 100 staff were contaminated with low doses of radiation. There are ongoing concerns around deterioration of the nuclear waste site on the  of the  and a potential radioactive spill.\nScavenging of abandoned radioactive material has been the cause of several other cases of , mostly in , which may have less regulation of dangerous substances (and sometimes less general education about radioactivity and its hazards) and a market for scavenged goods and scrap metal. The scavengers and those who buy the material are almost always unaware that the material is radioactive and it is selected for its  or scrap value. Irresponsibility on the part of the radioactive material's owners, usually a hospital, university or military, and the absence of regulation concerning radioactive waste, or a lack of enforcement of such regulations, have been significant factors in radiation exposures. For an example of an accident involving radioactive scrap originating from a hospital see the .\nTransportation accidents involving spent nuclear fuel from power plants are unlikely to have serious consequences due to the strength of the .\nOn 15 December 2011, top government spokesman Osamu Fujimura of the Japanese government admitted that nuclear substances were found in the waste of Japanese nuclear facilities. Although Japan did commit itself in 1977 to these inspections in the safeguard agreement with the IAEA, the reports were kept secret for the inspectors of the . Japan did start discussions with the IAEA about the large quantities of enriched uranium and plutonium that were discovered in nuclear waste cleared away by Japanese nuclear operators. At the press conference Fujimura said: \"Based on investigations so far, most nuclear substances have been properly managed as waste, and from that perspective, there is no problem in safety management,\" But according to him, the matter was at that moment still being investigated.\nThe trefoil symbol used to indicate ionizing radiation.\n2007 ISO radioactivity danger symbol intended for IAEA Category 1, 2 and 3 sources defined as dangerous sources capable of death or serious injury.\nThe dangerous goods transport classification sign for radioactive materials\n"},

The causes of food waste or loss are numerous and occur at the stages of , , retailing and consuming.\nGlobal food loss and waste amount to between one-third and one-half of all food produced. Loss and wastage occur at all stages of the food  or . In low-income countries, most loss occurs during production, while in developed countries much food \u2013 about 100 kilograms (220\u00a0lb) per person per year \u2013 is wasted at the consumption stage.\nFood waste is food that is lost during any of the four stages of the food supply chain: (1) producers, (2) processors, (3) retailers, and (4) consumers. Precise definitions are contentious, often defined on a situational basis (as is the case more generally with definitions of ). , including international organizations, state governments and secretariats may use their own definitions.\nAmong other things, in what food waste consists of, how it is produced, and where or what it is discarded from or generated by. Definitions also vary because certain groups do not consider (or have traditionally not considered) food waste to be a waste material, due to its applications. Some definitions of what food waste consists of are based on other waste definitions (e.g. agricultural waste) and which materials do not meet their definitions.\nLost food may go to landfills, be put back into the food supply chain, or be put to other nonfood productive uses.\nUnder the UN's Save Food initiative, the FAO, UNEP, and stakeholders have agreed on the following definition of food loss and waste:\nImportant components of this definition include:\nIn the , food waste was defined as \"any food substance, raw or cooked, which is discarded, or intended or required to be discarded\" since 1975 until 2000 when the old  was repealed by Directive 2008/98/EC, which has no specific definition of food waste. The directive, 75/442/EEC, containing this definition was amended in 1991 (91/156) with the addition of \"categories of waste\" (Annex I) and the omission of any reference to national law.\nThe  defines food waste for the  as \"uneaten food and food preparation wastes from residences and commercial establishments such as grocery stores, restaurants, and produce stands, institutional cafeterias and kitchens, and industrial sources like employee lunchrooms\". The states remain free to define food waste differently for their purposes, though many choose not to. According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, Americans throw away up to 40% of food that is safe to eat.\nThe definitions by the UN and EU have come under criticism for including food that goes to nonfood productive use in their definitions of food waste. According to the authors of one study, this is flawed for two reasons: \"First, if recovered food is used as an input, such as animal feed, fertilizer, or biomass to produce output, then by definition it is not wasted. However, there might be economic losses if the cost of recovered food is higher than the average cost of inputs in the alternative, nonfood use. Second, the definition creates practical problems for measuring food waste because the measurement requires tracking food loss in every stage of the supply chain and its proportion that flows to nonfood uses.\" The authors of the study argue that only food that ends up in landfills should be counted as food waste.\nIn the US, food waste can occur at most stages of the  and in significant amounts. In , the amounts of food waste are unknown, but are likely to be insignificant by comparison, due to the limited stages at which waste can occur, and given that food is grown for projected need as opposed to a  demand. Nevertheless, on-farm losses in storage in developing countries, particularly in African countries, can be high although the exact nature of such losses is much debated.\nIn the food industry of the , the food supply of which is the most diverse and abundant of any country in the world, waste occurs from the beginning of food production chain. From planting, crops can be subjected to  and , which cause losses before harvest. Since natural forces (e.g. temperature and precipitation) remain the primary drivers of crop growth, losses from these can be experienced by all forms of outdoor agriculture. On average, farms in the United States lose up to six billion pounds of crops every year because of these unpredictable conditions. The use of  in harvesting can cause waste, as harvesters may be unable to discern between ripe and immature crops, or collect only part of a crop. Economic factors, such as regulations and standards for quality and appearance, also cause food waste; farmers often harvest selectively, preferring to leave crops not to standard in the field (where they can be used as fertilizer or animal feed), since they would otherwise be discarded later. This method of removing undesirable produce from harvest collection, distribution sites and grocery stores is called . The USDA defines culling as \u201cthe individual removal of genetically undesirable, inferior, weak, diseased, or infested plants from a planting in order to ensure the level of genetic purity or vigor of the crop\u201d.  However, usually when culling occurs at the production, food processing, retail and consumption stages, it is to remove or dispose of produce with a strange or imperfect appearance rather than produce that is spoiled or unsafe to eat. In urban areas, fruit and nut trees often go unharvested because people either don't realize that the fruit is edible or they fear that it is contaminated, despite research which shows that urban fruit is safe to consume.\nFood waste continues in the  stage, but the amounts of  involved are relatively unknown and difficult to estimate. Regardless, the variety of factors that contribute to food waste, both biological/environmental and , would limit the usefulness and reliability of general figures. In , considerable quantitative losses can be attributed to  and . This is a particular problem for countries that experience a combination of heat (around 30\u00a0\u00b0C) and ambient humidity (between 70 and 90 per cent), as such conditions encourage the reproduction of insect pests and micro-organisms. Losses in the ,  and edibility of crops, by extremes of temperature, humidity or the action of micro-organisms, also account for food waste.  Further losses are generated in the handling of food and by shrinkage in weight or volume.\nSome of the food waste produced by  can be difficult to reduce without affecting the quality of the finished product.  are able to claim foods which contradict standards before they reach markets. Although this can conflict with efforts to reuse food waste (such as in animal feed), safety regulations are in place to ensure the health of the consumer; they are vitally important, especially in the processing of  (e.g. meat and dairy products), as contaminated products from these sources can lead to and are associated with  and  hazards.\n protects food from damage during its transportation from farms and factories via warehouses to retailing, as well as preserving its freshness upon arrival. Although it avoids considerable food waste, packaging can compromise efforts to reduce food waste in other ways, such as by contaminating waste that could be used for animal feedstocks.\nIn 2013 the non-profit  (NRDC) performed research that they state suggests that the leading cause of food waste in America is due to uncertainty over food expiration dates, such as confusion in deciphering . Joined by Harvard Law, the NRDC produced a study called . This United States-based study looked at the intertwining laws which lead labeling to end up unclear and erratic. This uncertainty leads to consumers to toss food, most often because they think the food may be unsafe or misunderstand the labeling on the food completely. Lack of regulation on labeling can result in large quantities of food being removed from the market overall.\nRetail stores throw away large quantities of food. Usually, this consists of items that have reached either their  Food that has passed the best before, and sell-by date, and even some food that passed the use-by date is still edible at the time of disposal, but stores have widely varying policies to handle the excess food. Some stores put effort into preventing access to poor or homeless people, while others work with charitable organizations to distribute food. Retailers also contribute to waste as a result of their contractual arrangements with suppliers. Failure to supply agreed quantities renders farmers or processors liable to have their contracts cancelled. As a consequence, they plan to produce more than actually required to meet the contract, to have a margin of error. Surplus production is often simply disposed of.\nRetailers usually have strict cosmetic standards for produce, and if fruits or  or superficially bruised, they are often not put on the shelf. In the United States, an estimated six billion pounds of produce is wasted each year because of its appearance.  The USDA publishes guidelines used as a baseline assessment by produce distributors, grocery stores, restaurants and other consumers in order to rate the quality of food. These guidelines and how they rate are readily available on their website. For example, apples get graded by their size, color, wax residue, firmness, and skin appearance.  If an apples rank highly in these categories and show close to no superficial defects, they are rated as \u201cU.S. Extra Fancy\u201d or \u201cU.S. Fancy\u201d, these are the typical ratings sought out by grocery stores when purchasing their produce.  Any apples with suboptimal levels of appearance are ranked as either \u201cU.S. Number 1\u201d or \u201cUtility\u201d and are not normally purchased for retail, as recommended by produce marketing sources, despite being safe and edible.\nThe fish industry also contributes to the annual amount of food waste because of cosmetic standards that the fish are held up to. Nearly \"2.3 million tonnes of fish (are) discarded in the North Atlantic and the North Sea each year.\" Approximately 40 to 60 percent of \"all fish caught in Europe is discarded \u2013 either because they are the wrong size or species.\" Addressing this, there are many campaigns focused on raising retailer and consumer awareness about food that fails to meet certain standards for appearance.\nConsumers are directly and indirectly responsible for wasting a lot of food, which could for a large part be avoided if they were willing to accept suboptimal food (SOF) that deviates in sensory characteristics (odd shapes, discolourations) or has a best-before date that is approaching or has passed, but is still perfectly fine to eat. (nsumers in a tainable food supply chain) is a SUSFOOD ERA-net research project under the topic 'Understanding consumer behaviour to encourage a (more) sustainable food choice'. There are organizations around the country working to rescue and redistribute food to those in need. Many of these rely on volunteer support. Some of them are Feeding America, Food Recovery Network and Community Plates.\nThe 2011  study estimated the total of global food loss and waste to around one third of the edible parts of food produced for human consumption, amounting to about 1.3\u00a0billion tonnes (1.2810 long tons; 1.4310 short tons) per year.  As the following table shows, industrialized and developing countries differ substantially. In developing countries, it is estimated that 400\u2013500 calories per day per person are going to waste, while in developed countries 1,500 calories per day per person are wasted. In the former, more than 40% of losses occur at the postharvest and processing stages, while in the latter, more than 40% of losses occur at the retail and consumer levels. The total food waste by consumers in industrialized countries (222\u00a0million tonnes or 218,000,000 long tons or 245,000,000 short tons) is almost equal to the entire food production in  Africa (230\u00a0million tonnes or 226,000,000 long tons or 254,000,000 short tons).\nA 2013 report from the British  (IME) likewise estimated that 30\u201350% (or 1.2\u20132\u00a0billion tonnes or 1.1810\u20131.9710 long tons or 1.3210\u20132.2010 short tons ) of all food produced remains uneaten.\nEach year in New South Wales, more than 25 million meals are delivered by charity  from food that would otherwise be wasted. Each year, the Australian economy loses $20 billion in food Waste. This has a crucial environmental impact through the waste of resources used to produce, manufacture, package and distribute that food. \nIn addition, it is estimated that 7.6 million tonnes of CO is generated by the disposed food in landfills. It is also the cause of odour, leaching and potential generation for diseases. In march 2019, the Australian ministry of the environment shared the key findings of Australia\u2019s National food waste baseline, which will facilitate the tracking of the progress towards their goal to halve Australian food waste by 2030. \nMany initiatives were taken on by the Australian government in order to help achieve this goal. In fact, they financed $1.2 million in organizations that invest in renewable energies systems to store and transport food. They also funded more than $10 million for research on food waste reduction. Local governments have also implemented programs such as information sessions on storing food and composting, diversion of waste from restaurants and cafes from landfills to shared recycling facilities and donation of food to organizations that would otherwise be wasted. \u00a0\nIn Canada, 58% of all food is wasted, amounting to 35.5 million tonnes of food per annuum.  The value of this lost food is equivalent to CA$21 billion. Such quantities of food would be enough to feed all Canadians for five months. It is estimated that about one third of this waste could be spared and sent to those in need.  There are many factors that contribute so such large-scale waste. Manufacturing and processing food alone incur costs of CA$21 billion, or 4.82 million tons. Per household, it is estimated that $1,766 is lost in food loss and waste.  The Government of Canada identifies three main factors contributing to household waste: (1) buying too much food and not eating it before it spoils, (2) malfunctioning or poorly-designed packaging that does not deter spoilage rates or contamination, and (3) improper disposing of food \u2013 using garbage bins instead of those intended for organic waste. \nCanada, Mexico, and the United States are working together under the Commission for Environmental Cooperation in order to address the severe problem of food waste in North America.  \nCanada specifically is working in the following ways to reduce food waste: \nAccording to , over 700,000 tonnes per year of food is wasted every year in  in the entire food value chain from farm to fork. Due to the work of activist 's  movement, Denmark has achieved a national reduction in food waste by 25% in 5 years (2010\u20132015).\nIn France, approximately 1.3\u20131.9 million tonnes of food waste is produced every year, or between 20 and 30 kilograms per person per year.  Out of the 10 million tonnes of food that is either lost or wasted in the country, 7.1 million tonnes of food wasted in the country, only 11% comes from supermarkets.  Not only does this cost the French \u20ac16 billion per year, but also the negative impact on the environment is also shocking. In France, food waste emits 15.3 million tonnes of CO, which represents 3% of the country\u2019s total CO emission.  In response to this issue, France has become the first country in the world to pass a unanimous legislation that bans supermarkets from throwing away or destroying unsold food. Instead, supermarkets are expected to donate such food to charities and food banks.  In addition to donating food, many businesses claim to prevent food waste by selling soon-to-be wasted products at discounted prices.  in France has outlined eleven measures to achieve a food waste reduction by half by 2025. \nAccording to the research of , an average Hungarian consumer generates 68\u00a0kg food waste annually. 49% of this amount would be avoidable.\nAccording to a publication of  report it is estimated that in the Netherlands, between 30% and 50% of all food produced is lost or thrown away. In total, people in the Netherlands waste at least 9.5m tonnes of food per year, worth at least \u20ac4.4bn.\nIn , 788,600 tonnes (776,100 long tons; 869,300 short tons) of food was wasted in 2014. Of that, 101,400 tonnes (99,800 long tons; 111,800 short tons) were recycled.  Since Singapore has limited agriculture ability, the country spent about S$14.8\u00a0billion (US$10.6\u00a0billion) on importing food in 2014. US$1.4\u00a0billion of it ends up being wasted, or 13 percent.\nIn the UK, 6,700,000 tonnes (6,590,000 long tons; 7,390,000 short tons) per year of wasted food (purchased and edible food which is discarded) amounts to a cost of \u00a310.2\u00a0billion each year. This represents costs of \u00a3250 to \u00a3400 a year per household.\nEstimates of food waste in the United States range from 35 million tons to 103 million tons. In a study done by National Geographic in 2014, Elizabeth Royte indicated more than 30 percent of food in the United States, valued at $162\u00a0billion annually, isn't eaten. The  conducted a study in 2004, which indicated that 14 to 15% of  edible food is untouched or unopened, amounting to $43\u00a0billion worth of discarded, but edible, food. In 2010, the  has come forth with estimations from the  that approximates food waste in the United States to be equivalent to 141 trillion calories.\nAccording to the  (FAO), food waste is responsible for 8 percent of global human-made  emissions.\nThe FAO concludes that nearly 30 percent of all available agricultural land in the world - 1.4 billion hectares - is used for produced but uneaten food. The global blue  of food waste is 250\u00a0km, that is the amount of water that flows annually through the  or 3 times .\nResponse to the problem of food waste at all social levels has varied hugely, including campaigns from advisory and environmental groups, and concentrated media attention on the subject.\nOne way of dealing with food waste is to reduce its creation. Consumers can reduce spoilage by planning their food shopping, avoiding potentially wasteful spontaneous purchases, and storing foods properly (and also ).  Widespread educational campaigns have been shown to be an effective way to reduce food waste.  A British campaign called \u201c\u201d has raised awareness about preventative measures to address food waste for consumers. Through advertisements, information on food storage and preparation and in-store education, the UK observed a 21% decrease in avoidable household food waste over the course of 5 years. Another potential solution is for \"smart packaging\" which would indicate when food is spoiled more precisely than expiration dates currently do, for example with , plastic that changes color when exposed to oxygen, or gels that change color with time.\nAn initiative in  called Cambio Verde allows farmers to provide surplus produce (produce they would otherwise discard due to too low prices) to people that bring glass and metal to recycling facilities (to encourage further waste reduction). In Europe, the Food Surplus Entrepreneurs Network (FSE Network), coordinates a network of social businesses and nonprofit initiatives with the goal to spread best practices to increase the use of surplus food and reduction of food waste.\nIn areas where the waste collection is a public function, food waste is usually managed by the same governmental organization as other waste collection. Most food waste is combined with general waste at the source. Separate collections, also known as , have the advantage that food waste can be disposed of in ways not applicable to other wastes. In the United States, companies find higher and better uses for large commercial generators of food and beverage waste.\nFrom the end of the 19th century through the middle of the 20th century, many municipalities collected food waste (called \"garbage\" as opposed to \"trash\") separately. This was typically disinfected by steaming and fed to pigs, either on private farms or in municipal piggeries.\nSeparate curbside collection of food waste is now being revived in some areas. To keep collection costs down and raise the rate of food waste segregation, some local authorities, especially in Europe, have introduced \"alternate weekly collections\" of biodegradable waste (including, e.g., garden waste), which enable a wider range of recyclable materials to be collected at reasonable cost, and improve their collection rates. However, they result in a two-week wait before the waste will be collected. The criticism is that particularly during hot weather, food waste rots and stinks, and attracts . Waste container design is therefore essential to making such operations feasible. Curbside collection of food waste is also done in the U.S., some ways by combining food scraps and yard waste together. Several states in the U.S. have introduced a yard waste ban, not accepting leaves, brush, trimmings, etc. in landfills. Collection of food scraps and yard waste combined is then recycled and composted for reuse.\nFood waste from restaurants and catering companies can be shredded and the slurry used for production of  by anaerobic fermentation.  It has been suggested that degradation and long retention time in the transportation chain may alter the hazardous properties of the food waste slurry, in particular its ability to release poisonous .\nAs alternatives to , food waste can be  to produce soil and fertilizer, fed to animals or insects, or used to produce energy or . Some wasted fruit parts, ... can also be  to extract useful substances for the industry (i.e. succinic acid from orange peels, lycopene from tomato peels, ...).\nDumping food waste in a landfill causes odour as it decomposes, attracts flies and vermin, and has the potential to add  (BOD) to the leachate. The European Union  and Waste Regulations, like regulations in other countries, enjoin diverting organic wastes away from landfill disposal for these reasons. Starting in 2015, organic waste from New York City restaurants will be banned from landfills.\nIn countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom, food scraps constitute around 19% of the waste buried in landfills, where it biodegrades very easily and produces methane, a powerful greenhouse gas.\nMethane, or CH, is the second most prevalent greenhouse gas that is released into the air, also produced by landfills in the U.S. Although methane spends less time in the atmosphere (12 years) than CO, it's more efficient at trapping radiation. It is 25 times greater to impact climate change than CO in a 100-year period. Humans accounts over 60% of  globally.\nLarge quantities of fish, meat, dairy and grain are discarded at a global scale annually, when they can be used for things other than human consumption. The feeding of  to  such as pigs or chickens is, historically, the most common way of dealing with household food waste. The animals turn roughly two thirds of their ingested food into gas or fecal waste, while the last third is digested and repurposed as meat or dairy products. There are also different ways of growing produce and feeding  that could ultimately reduce waste.\nBread and other cereal products discarded from the human food chain could be used to feed chickens. Chickens have traditionally been given mixtures of waste  and  by-products in a mixture called . As well, giving table scraps to  is a large part of that movement's claim to sustainability, though not all backyard chicken growers recommend it.  and  have also been fed bakery waste for a long time.\nCertain food waste (such as flesh) can also be used as feed in . The maggots can then be fed to other animals. In China, some food waste is being processed by feeding it to cockroaches. Also,  larvae can be grown on food waste.\nFood waste can be  by , and reused to fertilize . Composting is the aerobic process completed by microorganisms in which the bacteria break down the food waste into simpler organic materials that can then be used in soil. By redistributing nutrients and high microbial populations, compost reduces water runoff and soil erosion by enhancing rainfall penetration, which has been shown to reduce the loss of sediment, nutrients, and pesticide losses to streams by 75\u201395%.\nTraditional composting uses microbes to perform the decomposition, a process that is most efficient using low, mid, and high temperature microbes (psychrophilic,  mesophilic, and thermophilic \u2013 respectively). The high temperatures required by the thermophilic microorganisms are hot enough to kill pathogens, making the product of this traditional composting satisfactory for use in soil according to the 's (EPA) standards. The traditional decomposition process requires a long length of time and additional energy expended to turn the material frequently and maintain the aerobic process. Composting by thermophilic microbes can lead to nutrient loss and the compost product is heterogeneous, with the potential for higher levels of contaminants which can be harmful if used in agriculture. An alternate method of composting is vermicomposting.\n is the practise of feeding scraps to worms who produce fertilized  as a byproduct. The process of composting using earth worms is completed in a short duration of time and requires no additional energy to turn and maintain aerobic processes, as these actions are already performed by the worms. In order to keep the worms alive, the environment has to be kept below 35\u00b0 Celsius, therein making this compost ineligible for use in agriculture according to the EPA standards. The product of vermicomposting is homogenous and generally contains lower levels of contaminants than traditional composting. Some look to integrate vermicomposting and traditional composting in an effort to maximize efficiency while producing a high quality organic product that can be used in agriculture.\nComposting food waste leads to a decrease in the quantity of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere. In landfills, organic food waste decomposes anaerobically, producing methane gas that is emitted into the atmosphere. When this biodegradable waste is composted, it decomposes aerobically and does not produce methane, but instead produces organic compost that can then be utilized in agriculture. Recently, the city of New York has begun to require that restaurants and food-producing companies begin to compost their leftover food. Another instance of composting progress is a Wisconsin-based company called WasteCap, who is dedicated towards aiding local communities create composting plans.\nMunicipal Food Waste (MFW) can be composted to create this product of organic fertilizer, and many municipalities choose to do this citing environmental protection and economic efficiency as reasoning.  Transporting and dumping waste in landfills requires both money and room in the landfills that have very limited available space. One municipality who chose to regulate MFW is San Francisco, who requires citizens to separate compost from trash on their own, instituting fines for non-compliance at $100 for individual homes and $500 for businesses. The city's economic reasoning for this controversial mandate is supported by their estimate that one business can save up to $30000 annually on garbage disposal costs with the implementation of the required composting. Composting is an economical and environmentally conscious step many homeowners could take to reduce their impact on landfill waste. Instead of food scraps and spoiled food taking up space in trashcans or stinking up the kitchen before the bag is full, it could be put outside and broken down by worms and added to garden beds.\n produces both useful gaseous products and a solid fibrous \"compostable\" material. Anaerobic digestion plants can provide energy from waste by burning the methane created from food and other organic wastes to generate electricity, defraying the plants' costs and reducing  emissions.The  states that the use of anaerobic composting allows for large amounts of food waste to avoid the landfills. Instead of producing these greenhouse gasses into the environment from being in a landfill, the gasses can alternatively be harnessed in these facilities for reuse.\nSince this process of composting produces high volumes of biogas, there are potential safety issues such as explosion and poisoning. These interactions require proper maintenance and  is utilized. Certain U.S. states, such as Oregon, have implemented the requirement for permits on such facilities, based on the potential danger to the population and surrounding environment.\nFood waste coming through the sanitary sewers from  is treated along with other  and contributes to .\nCommercially, food waste in the form of  coming from commercial kitchens\u2019 sinks,  and floor drains is collected in holding tanks called  to minimize flow to the sewer system. This often foul-smelling waste contains both organic and inorganic waste (, etc.) and may also contain hazardous  gases. It is referred to as fats, oils, and grease (FOG) waste or more commonly \"brown grease\" (versus \"yellow grease\", which is fryer oil that is easily collected and processed into biodiesel) and is an overwhelming problem, especially in the US, for the aging sewer systems. Per the US EPA, sanitary sewer overflows also occur due to the improper discharge of FOGs to the collection system. Overflows discharge 3\u00a0billion US gallons (11,000,000\u00a0m) \u2013 10\u00a0billion US gallons (38,000,000\u00a0m) of untreated wastewater annually into local waterways, and up to 3,700 illnesses annually are due to exposure to contamination from sanitary sewer overflows into recreational waters.\nNearly all global produce, eaten or disposed of is grown using . Irrigated water represents the largest sector of water withdraws worldwide, with as much as 90% of total water withdraws being allocated towards agricultural usage. Food which goes uneaten can account for vast quantities of water waste, with food waste being the largest area the average US citizen contributes to water waste.\n"},

Toxic or  are often imported by  from developed countries. \nThe  Report , describes the amount of solid waste produced in a given country. Specifically, countries which produce more solid waste are more economically developed and more industrialized. The report explains that \"[g]enerally, the higher the economic development and rate of urbanization, the greater the amount of solid waste produced.\u201d Therefore, countries in the Global North, which are more economically developed and urbanized, produce more solid waste than Global South countries.\nCurrent international trade flows of waste follow a pattern of waste being produced in the Global North and being exported to and disposed of in the Global South. Multiple factors affect which countries produce waste and at what magnitude, including geographic location, degree of , and level of integration into the global economy.\n\nNumerous scholars and researchers have linked the sharp increase in waste trading and the negative impacts of waste trading to the prevalence of .  With the major economic transition towards neoliberal economic policy in the 1980s, the shift towards  policy has facilitated the sharp increase in the global waste trade. , Chair of Cultural Studies at McMaster University, gives his definition of neoliberal economic policy: \u201cNeoliberalism ...removes economics and markets from the discourse of social obligations and social costs. ...As a policy and political project, neoliberalism is wedded to the privatization of public services, selling off of state functions, deregulation of finance and labor, elimination of the welfare state and unions, liberalization of trade in goods and capital investment, and the marketization and  of society.\u201d Given this economic platform of privatization, neoliberalism is based on expanding free-trade agreements and establishing open-borders to international trade markets. , a  economic policy in which trade is completely , leaving no tariffs, quotas, or other restrictions on international trade, is designed to further developing countries\u2019 economies and integrate them into the global economy. Critics claim that although free-market trade liberalization was designed to allow any country the opportunity to reach economic success, the consequences of these policies have been devastating for Global South countries, essentially crippling their economies in a servitude to the Global North. Even supporters such as the , \u201cprogress of integration has been uneven in recent decades\u201d \nSpecifically, developing countries have been targeted by trade liberalization policies to import waste as a means of . The guiding neoliberal economic policy argues that the way to be integrated into the global economy is to participate in trade liberalization and exchange in international trade markets. Their claim is that smaller countries, with less infrastructure, less wealth, and less manufacturing ability, should take in hazardous wastes as a way to increase profits and stimulate their economies.\nCurrent supporters of global waste trade argue that importing waste is an economic transaction which can benefit countries with little to offer the . Countries which do not have the production capacity to manufacture high quality products can import waste to stimulate their economy.\n, former President of Harvard University and Chief Economist of the World Bank, issued a confidential memo arguing for global waste trade in 1991. The memo stated:\n\"I think the economic logic behind dumping a load of toxic waste in the lowest wage country is impeccable and we should face up to that\u2026 I\u2019ve always thought that countries in Africa are vastly under polluted; their air quality is probably vastly inefficiently low compared to Los Angeles\u2026 Just between you and me shouldn't the World Bank be encouraging more migration of the dirty industries to the Least Developed Countries?\"This position, which is mainly motivated by economics and financial profit in particular, demonstrates the main argument for global waste trade. The Cato Institute published an article supporting global waste trade suggesting that \u201cthere is little evidence that hazardous wastes, which are often chronic carcinogens, contribute to death rates in developing countries.\u201d Elaborating on this point, the article argues that \u201cpeople in developing countries would rationally accept increased exposure to hazardous pollutants in exchange for opportunities to increase their productivity\u2014and, hence, their income.\u201d\nOverall, the argument for global waste trade rests largely upon a perception that developing countries need to further their economic development. Supporters suggest that in engaging in global waste trade, developing countries of the Global South will expand their economies and increase profits.\nCritics of global waste trade claim that lack of regulation and failed policies have allowed developing nations to become toxic dump yards for hazardous waste. The ever-increasing amounts of hazardous waste being shipped to developing countries increases the disproportionate risk that the people in these nations face. Critics of the effects of the global waste trade emphasize the enormous amount of hazardous wastes that people in poorer countries must deal with. They highlight the fact that most of the world\u2019s hazardous wastes are produced by Western countries (the United States and Europe), yet the people who suffer  from these wastes are from poorer countries that did not produce the waste.\nPeter Newell, Professor of Development Studies, argues that \u201cenvironmental inequality reinforces and, at the same time reflects, other forms of hierarchy and exploitation along lines of class, race and gender.\u201d Arguing that the detrimental effects of hazardous waste trade affect the disadvantaged more than others, critics of global waste trade suggest that the implications of dumping hazardous waste has significant consequences for , women, and low-income people in particular.\n\nCritiquing the global waste trade for reproducing inequality on a global scale, many activists, organizers, and environmentalists from regions affected in the Global South have vocalized their disappointment with global waste trade policies. Evo Morales, former President of Bolivia, argues against the current economic system forcing the exploitation of his country and people. He claims:\"If we want to save the planet earth, to save life and humanity, we have a duty to put an end to the capitalist system. Unless we put an end to the capitalist system, it is impossible to imagine that there will be equality and justice on this planet earth. This is why I believe that it is important to put an end to the exploitation of human beings and to the pillage of natural resources, to put an end to destructive wars for markets and raw materials, to the plundering of energy, particularly fossil fuels, to the excessive consumption of goods and to the accumulation of waste. The capitalist system only allows us to heap up waste. Jean Francois Kouadio, an African native living near a toxic dump site in the Ivory Coast, explains his experience with the effects of toxic substances lingering throughout his community. With major Western corporations dumping their toxic wastes in the Ivory Coast, Kuoadio has lost two children to the effects of toxic wastes. He describes the loss of his second daughter Ama Grace, and how the doctors \"said she suffered from acute glycemia caused by the toxic waste.\"\nIn addition to critics from the Global South, researchers and scholars in the West have begun critiquing the uneven distribution of negative effects these hazardous waste dumpings are causing. , Professor at the University of Michigan, argues how Women of Color in the United States are disproportionately affected by these policies: \"Women of color have been at the forefront of the struggle to bring attention to the issues that are devastating minority communities \u2013 issues such as hazardous waste disposal; exposure to toxins; ...Their communities, some of the most degraded environments ... are repositories of the waste products of capitalist production and excessive consumption. As a result, they have been in the vanguard of the struggle for environmental justice; they are the founders of environmental groups, grassroots activists, researchers, conference organizers, workshop leaders, lobbyists, and campaign and community organizers.\"T.V. Reed, Professor of English and American Studies at Washington State University, argues that the correlation between historical colonialism and toxic colonialism is based on perceptions of indigenous land as \u2018waste.\u2019 He argues that Western cultures have deemed indigenous land as \u201cunderdeveloped\u201d and \u201cempty,\u201d and that the people inhabiting it are therefore less \u201ccivilized.\u201d Using the historical premises of colonialism, toxic colonialism reproduces these same arguments by defining Global South land as expendable for Western wastes.\n, defined as the process by which \u201cunderdeveloped states are used as inexpensive alternatives for the export or disposal of hazardous waste pollution by developed states,\u201d is the core critique against the global waste trade. Toxic colonialism represents the  policy which continues to maintain  today through unfair . Toxic colonialism uses the term colonialism because \u201cthe characteristics of colonialism, involving , , and cultural  are intimately associated within the new realm of toxic waste colonialism.\u201d \nElectronic waste, also known as e-waste, refers to discarded electrical or electronic devices. A rapidly growing surplus of electronic waste around the world has resulted from quickly evolving technological advances, changes in media (tapes, software, MP3), falling prices, and . An estimated 50 million tons of e-waste are produced each year, the majority of which comes from the United States and Europe. Most of this electronic waste is shipped to developing countries in Asia and Africa to be processed and recycled.\nVarious studies have investigated the  of this e-waste upon the people who live and work around electronic waste dumps.  , , and chemicals leak from these discarded products into surrounding waterways and groundwater,  the local people. People who work in these dumps, local children searching for items to sell, and people living in the surrounding communities are all exposed to these deadly toxins.\nOne city suffering from the negative results of the hazardous waste trade is , which has been called the electronic waste dump of the world. It may be the world's largest e-waste dump, with workers dismantling over 1.5 million pounds of junked computers, cell phones and other electronic devices per year.\n is the  produced when incinerators burn waste in order to dispose of it. Incineration has many  effects which include the release of various hazardous gases, , and .\nAn example of incinerator ash being dumped onto the Global South from the Global North in an unjust trade exchange is the . Carrying 14,000 tons of ash from an incinerator in Philadelphia, the cargo ship, Khian Sea, was to dispose of its waste. However, upon being rejected by The Dominican Republic, Panama, Honduras, Bermuda, Guinea Bissau, and the Dutch Antilles, the crew finally dumped a portion of the ash near Haiti. After changing the name of the ship twice to try and conceal the original identity, Senegal, Morocco, Yemen, Sri Lanka, and Singapore still banned the ship\u2019s entry. Upon consistent rejections, the ash is believed to have been disposed of in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Following this disaster of handling hazardous waste, the Haitian government banned all waste imports leading a movement to recognize all of the disastrous consequences of this global waste trade. Based on the Khian Sea waste disposal incident and similar events, the  was written to resist what is known to developing countries as \u2018toxic colonialism.\u2019 It was open for signature in March 1989 and went into effect in May 1992. The U.S. has signed the treaty, but has yet to ratify it.\n is the excess and unusable waste from hazardous chemicals, mainly produced by large factories. It is extremely difficult and costly to dispose of. It poses many problems and health risks upon exposure, and must be carefully treated in toxic waste processing facilities.\nOne example of chemical waste being exported from the Global North onto the Global South was the event of an Italian business man seeking to avoid European economic regulations. Allegedly exporting 4,000 tons of toxic waste, containing 150 tons of , or PCBs, the Italian businessman made $4.3 million in shipping hazardous waste to Nigeria. The Fordham Environmental Law Review published an article explaining the impacts of the toxic waste imposed on Nigeria in further detail:\n\"Mislabelling the garbage as fertilizers, the Italian company deceived a retired/illiterate timber worker into agreeing to store the poison in his backyard at the Nigerian river port of  for as little as 100 dollars a month. These toxic chemicals were exposed to the hot sun and to children playing nearby. They leaked into the Koko water system resulting in the death of nineteen villagers who ate contaminated rice from a nearby farm.\" This is just one example of how the traditional trade flow, from developed Western countries has severely, unfairly, and disproportionately impacted developing countries in the Global South.\nAnother danger to developing countries is the growing issue of , which is occurring mainly in Asia. Industrialized countries seeking to retire used vessels find it cheaper to send these ships to Asia for dismantling.  and  are seen as the two hubs of shipbreaking in Asia. One of the main issues lies in the fact that these ships which are now too aged to continue, were constructed at a time with less environmental regulation. In an environmental fact sheet, researchers demonstrate the immense impact this new toxic trade sector has on workers and the environment. For one, the older ships contain health-damaging substances such as , , , , , and . In addition, shipbreaking workers in China and in other developing countries traditionally lack proper equipment or protective gear when handling these toxic substances.\nThe trade in plastic waste has been identified as the main cause of marine litter.  Countries importing the waste plastics often lack the capacity to process all the material.  As a result, the United Nations has imposed a ban on waste plastic trade unless it meets certain criteria.\nThe global waste trade has had negative effects for many people, particularly in poorer, developing nations. These countries often do not have safe recycling processes or facilities, and people process the toxic waste with their bare hands. Hazardous wastes are often not properly disposed of or treated, leading to poisoning of the surrounding environment and resulting in illness and death in people and animals. Many people have experienced illnesses or death due to the unsafe way these hazardous wastes are handled.\nThe hazardous waste trade has disastrous effects upon the environment and natural ecosystems. Various studies explore how the concentrations of persistent organic pollutants have poisoned the areas surrounding the dump sites, killing numerous birds, fish, and other wildlife. There are heavy metal chemical concentrations in the air, water, soil, and sediment in and around these toxic dump areas, and the concentration levels of heavy metals in these areas are extremely high and toxic.\nThe hazardous waste trade has serious damaging effects upon the health of humans. People living in developing countries may be more vulnerable to the dangerous effects of the hazardous waste trade, and are particularly at risk from developing health problems. The methods of disposal of these toxic wastes in developing countries expose the general population (including future generations) to the highly toxic chemicals. These toxic wastes are often disposed of in open landfills, burned in incinerators, or in other dangerous processes. Workers wear little to no protective gear when processing these toxic chemicals, and are exposed to these toxins through direct contact, inhalation, contact with soil and dust, as well as oral intake of contaminated locally produced food and drinking water. Health problems resulting from these hazardous wastes affect humans by causing cancers, diabetes, alterations in neurochemical balances, hormone disruptions from , skin alterations, , kidney damage, , , , , , and many other fatal diseases. The improper disposal of these hazardous wastes creates fatal health problems, and is a serious public health risk.\nThere have been various international responses to the problems associated with the global waste trade and multiple attempts to regulate it for over thirty years. The hazardous waste trade has proven difficult to regulate as there is so much waste being traded, and laws are often difficult to enforce. Furthermore, there are often large loopholes in these international agreements that allow countries and corporations to dump hazardous wastes in dangerous ways. The most notable attempt to regulate the hazardous waste trade has been the .\nThe Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal, usually known as the , is an international treaty that plays a crucial role in regulating the transnational movement of hazardous wastes. The Basel Convention was created in 1989 and attempts to regulate the hazardous waste trade, specifically to prevent the dumping of hazardous waste from more developed countries into less developed countries. The Basel Convention was developed following a series of high-profile cases in which large amounts of toxic waste were dumped into less developed countries, poisoning the people and environment. The Convention seeks to reduce the creation of hazardous wastes, and to control and reduce its trade across borders.\nThe Convention was opened for signatures on 22 March 1989, and officially entered into force on 5 May 1992. As of May 2014, 180 states and the European Union are parties to the Convention. Haiti and the United States have signed the Convention but not ratified it.\nThe  (ENFORCE) is an agency staffed by relevant experts to promote compliance with the Basel Convention. It is an international body created to deal with transboundary issues of the international hazardous waste trade. Because the issue of the transnational hazardous waste trade crosses many borders and affects many nations, it has been important to have a multinational, multilateral organization presiding over these affairs. The members of ENFORCE include one representative from each of the five United Nations regions that are parties to the Convention as well as five representatives from the Basel Convention regional and coordinating centers, based on equitable geographical representation. Members of organizations such as the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP), International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL), NGOs working to prevent and stop illegal traffic such as the Basel Action Network (BAN), and many other organizations are also eligible to become members of ENFORCE.\nIn 1999 the Basel Convention passed the Protocol on Liability and Compensation that sought to improve regulatory measures and better protect people from hazardous waste. The Protocol on Liability and Compensation attempts to \u201cassign appropriate liability procedures when the transboundary movements of hazardous wastes result in damages to human health and the environment\u201d. The Protocol \u201cimposes strict liability for damages in situations involving Parties to the Basel Convention, but only while they maintain control of the hazardous waste through their respective notifying, transporting, or disposing entities.\u201d It seeks to regulate and ensure countries\u2019 and corporations\u2019 compliance with the Basel Convention laws. However, this Protocol remains unsigned by most countries, so its applicability is limited.\nIn an effort to protect themselves against unfair hazardous waste dumping, the African, Caribbean, and Pacific States (ACP) signed the Lome IV Convention, which is a supplement to the Basel Convention and prohibits the \u201cexport of hazardous wastes from the European Community to ACP States.\u201d This Convention is one attempt by developing countries to protect themselves from Western countries exporting their waste to poorer nations through the hazardous waste trade. When the Lom\u00e9 IV Convention expired in 2000, the ACP countries and the European countries entered into a new agreement known as the Cotonou Agreement, which \u201crecognizes the existence of disproportionate risks in developing countries and desires to protect against inappropriate hazardous waste shipments to these countries.\u201d\nIn 1991 multiple developing nations in Africa met to discuss their dissatisfaction with the Basel Convention in regulating the dumping of hazardous waste into their countries, and designed a ban on the import of hazardous wastes into their countries called the . The Bamako Convention is different from the Basel Convention in that Bamako \u201cessentially bans the import of all hazardous waste generated outside of the OAU [the Organization of African Unity] for disposal or recycling and deems any import from a non-Party to be an illegal act.\u201d However, these countries could not effectively implement the stipulations of the Convention and could not prevent the dump of toxic wastes due to limited resources and a lack of powerful enforcement. Therefore, the application of the Bamako Convention was very limited.\n, expert on the hazardous waste trade, claims that despite local and international attempts to regulate the hazardous waste trade, the \u201ccurrent international agreements, both the widespread, legally binding agreements and the ad hoc agendas among smaller groups of countries, have not been as successful at eliminating toxic waste colonialism as proponents would have hoped.\u201d She explains that there are various loopholes in the current system that allow toxic waste to continue being dumped, and toxic colonialism to go unchecked. Some of the problems with these international agreements include continued illegal shipments and unclear definitions of terms.\nPratt explains that despite attempts to regulate illegal dumping, \u201c[o]ftentimes hazardous waste is simply moved under false permits, bribes, improper labels, or even the pretext of 'recycling,' which is a growing trend.\u201d Companies often export their hazardous wastes to poorer countries through illegal smuggling. Attempts to regulate this market have been hindered by a lack of ability to monitor the trade, as many countries do not have any authoritative legislative bodies in place to prevent or punish the illegal trafficking of hazardous wastes. Furthermore, Pratt explains that without coordinated international methods to enforce the regulations, it is extremely difficult for countries to \"control the illegal trade of hazardous waste, due to the disparity between enforcement resources and regulation uniformity.\u201d  Developing nations still bear the brunt of this illegal activity the most, and often do not have the resources or capability to protect themselves.\nAnother issue with the Basel Convention and other international agreements to regulate the waste trade is the difficulty of establishing clear, uniform definitions regarding wastes. These overly broad and ambiguous definitions cause problems with the international agreements, as different parties interpret the language of the agreements differently and thus act accordingly. For example, the \u201c\u2018lack of distinction between \u2018waste\u2019 and \u2018products\u2019 in the convention and its vague criteria for \u2018hazardous\u2019 allowed the continued export of 'hazardous waste\u2019 under the label of commodities or raw materials, despite the fact that these wastes still present environmental and health risks to developing countries.\u201d\n"},

Efforts are being made to recycle and reduce this waste.\nThe Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal, usually known simply as the Basel Convention, is an international treaty that was designed to reduce the movements of hazardous waste between nations, and specifically to prevent transfer of hazardous waste from developed to less developed countries.\nOf the 172 parties to the Convention, Afghanistan, Haiti, and the United States have signed the Convention but have not yet ratified it.\nThe  (UNCTAD) tends to support the repair and recycling trade. Mining to produce the same metals, to meet demand for finished products in the west, also occurs in the same countries, and UNCTAD has recommended that restrictions against recycling exports be balanced against the environmental costs of recovering those materials from mining. Hard rock mining produces 45% of all toxins produced by all industries in the United States.\n contends that residue problems are so significant that the exports of all used electronics should be banned.\nThe e-Waste Association of South Africa (eWASA) was established in 2008 to manage the establishment of a sustainable environmentally sound e-waste management system for the country. Since then the non-profit organization has been working with manufacturers, vendors and distributors of electronic and electrical goods and e-waste handlers (including re-furbishers, dismantlers and recyclers) to manage e-waste effectively.\nMany Asian countries have legislated, or will do so, for electronic waste recycling.\n,  and  ensure manufacturer responsibility by demanding that they recycle 75% of their annual production.\nChinese laws are primarily concerned with eliminating the import of e-waste.  has ratified the  as well as the Basel Ban Amendment, officially banning the import of e-waste. In October 2008, The  also approved a \"draft regulation on the management of electronic waste.\" This regulation is intended to promote the continued use of resources through recycling and to monitor the end-of-life treatment of electronics. Under the new regulations, recycling of electronics by the consumer is mandated. It also requires the recycling of unnecessary materials discarded in the manufacturing process.\nIndia has emerged as fifth largest e-waste producer in world.Telecom equipments account for 12% of e-waste.\nSome European countries implemented laws prohibiting the disposal of electronic waste in landfills in the 1990s. \"This created an e-waste processing industry in Europe.\"\nIn , the first electronic waste recycling system was implemented in 1991, beginning with collection of old refrigerators. Over the years, all other electric and electronic devices were gradually included in the system. Legislation followed in 1998, and since January 2005 it has been possible to return all electronic waste to the sales points and other collection points free of charge. There are two established producer responsibility organizations: SWICO, mainly handling information, communication, and organization technology, and SENS, responsible for electrical appliances. The total amount of recycled electronic waste exceeds 10\u00a0kg per capita per year.\nAdditionally, the  has implemented several directives and regulations that place the responsibility for \"recovery, reuse and recycling\" on the manufacturer.\nThe  (WEEE Directive), as it is often referred to, has now been transposed in national laws in all member countries of the European Union. It was designed to make equipment manufacturers financially or physically responsible for their equipment at the end of its life, under a policy known as  (EPR). \"Users of electrical and electronic equipment from private households should have the possibility of returning WEEE at least free of charge\", and manufacturers must dispose of it in an environmentally friendly manner, by ecological disposal, reuse, or refurbishment. EPR is seen as a useful policy as it internalizes the end-of-life costs and provided a competitive incentive for companies to design equipment with fewer costs and liabilities when it reached its end of life. However, the application of the WEEE Directive has been criticized for implementing the EPR concept in a collective manner, and thereby losing the competitive incentive of individual manufacturers to be rewarded for their green design.[32] Since August 13, 2005, electronics manufacturers have become financially responsible for compliance to the WEEE Directive. Under the directive, each country recycles at least 4\u00a0kg of electronic waste per capita per year. Furthermore, the Directive should \"decrease e-waste and e-waste exports.\". In December 2008 a draft revision to the Directive proposed a market-based goal of 65%, which is 22\u00a0kg per capita in the case of the United Kingdom. A decision on the proposed revisions could result in a new WEEE Directive by 2012.\nThe Directive on the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (2002/95/EC), commonly referred to as the  (RoHS Directive), was also adopted in February 2003 by the European Union. The RoHS Directive took effect on July 1, 2006, and is required to be enforced and become law in each member state. This directive restricts the use of six  in the manufacture of various types of electronic and electrical equipment.\nThe  enacted in 2006 regulates the manufacture, disposal and trade of batteries in the European Union.\nIn February 2004, a fee similar to the one in California was added to the cost of purchasing new televisions, computers, and computer components in , the first of its kind in .  also implemented an electronics recycling fee in February 2007, followed by  in August 2007,  in February 2008,  in April 2009, and  in October 2012.  In 2007,  issued the Proposed Electrical and Electronic Equipment Stewardship Regulation by which the sale of regulated products is forbidden unless covered by the stewardship program. \"Products covered under this legislation include TVs, computers, laptops, and scanners.\" Recycling regulation passed in Ontario in October 2004, requires producers to \"either develop product stewardship plans or comply with a product stewardship program for specific products.\"\n\nThe Export and Import of Hazardous Waste and Hazardous Recyclable Material Regulations (EIHWHRMR) operates with a few basic premises, one of which being that electronic waste is either \"intact\" or \"not intact\".  The various annexes define hazardous waste in Canada, and also deem any waste that is \"...considered or defined as hazardous under the legislation of the country receiving it and is prohibited by that country from being imported or conveyed in transit\" to be covered under Canadian regulation and therefore subject to prior informed consent procedures.\nThe loophole in the regulations that allows tons of e-waste to be exported from Canada is the use of the definition of \"intact\" vs \"functional\".  A non-functioning electronic device that is intact can be exported under the current legislation.  What can't be exported is a non-functioning but no longer intact electronic device.  The principal problem being, the non-functioning electronic device is at high risk of being disassembled in some far away e-waste dumping ground.  The Canadian government's use of a unique interpretation of the Basel Convention obligations \"intact\" and \"not intact\" opens the door to uncontrolled e-waste exports as long as the device is intact.  See Canadian fact sheet and associated links.\nSince Canada ratified the Basel Convention on August 28, 1992, and as of August 2011, Environment Canada's Enforcement Branch has initiated 176 investigations for violations under EIHWHRMR, some of which are still in progress.  There have been 19 prosecutions undertaken for non-compliance with the provisions of the EIHWHRMR some of which are still before the courts.\nIsrael adopted a national e-waste law that went into effect March 1, 2014. By 2021, the law demands that electronic companies must recycle at least 50% of the weight of the electronics they sell. In addition, these companies are required to accept old electronics from consumers free of charge. Israel\u2019s e-waste laws have resulted in much greater participation in recycling. One of Israel\u2019s main companies, M.A.I., an electronics recycling corporation, has reported that they have recycled 5000 tons of electronic waste in 2014, which already exceeds their personal requirement of recycling 4700 tons.\nEPR laws in Latin America are present but could use improvement in terms of the \u201cconsistency regarding criteria for the development of new EPR programs that has impeded the broad development of EPR laws, such as post evaluation programs, overall cost of waste management, reduction in the use of resources and decrease of the public sector burden\u201d . However, one aspect that differentiates their laws from those currently present in the U.S. is that they are quickly moving away from voluntary laws and working towards implementing more direct/demanding policies. Countries such as \u201cColombia, Costa Rica, and Chile have been the first in the region to introduce EPR as a policy approach that seeks to address the problems of pollution and overflowing landfills by implementing alternatives for waste management\u201d .\nGiven the rise of waste production during the past decade, solid waste management has recently become a central concern for Chile\u2019s government. In 2009, the Chilean National Environmental Commission identified Chile as \u201cone of the countries with the highest rates of waste generation in Latin America\u201d . They\u2019ve since been working to implement a law, with the help of the National Environment Commission (CONAMA), that would add regulatory power over waste production. In August 2013, the Chilean congress approved a law that established a framework for waste management, EPR and the encouragement of recycling.\nIn 2013, Colombia implemented an EPR law that ultimately focused on enforcing guidelines for managing electronic waste. Additionally, the country has developed a number of \u201cpost-consumer programs for used batteries, medicine, computers and printers, fluorescent light bulbs, used tires and pesticide containers\u201d . Today, Colombia has a legal framework for EPR in place.\nUpon its implementation in 2006, the Mercosur Policy Agreement mandated Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay to anchor EPR laws as environmental policies . Brazil enacted a National Policy to reduce solid waste which ultimately acted as an EPR and as a way to reduce both solid and hazardous waste.\nElectronic waste has been on the agenda of the Australian Federal Government since the mid-1990s.  The Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council (now replaced by the Environment Protection and Heritage Council (EPHC)) was the first body to identify electrical and electronic waste as a concern.  In 2002, the EPHC again declared that e-waste needed action.  The Electrical Equipment Product Stewardship Sub-Group examined the issue and decided that computer and television waste were 'wastes of concern'.  Since that time the television and computer industry has been working with the EPHC to identify a suitable way to manage end-of-life televisions and computers.\nIn November 2008 the EPHC committed to the development of a national solution to the issue of managing television and computer waste.  This action culminated in the release of a package of documents designed to enable public consultation on the various options for managing end-of-life televisions and computers on 16 July 2009.  The main document in the package is the Consultation Regulatory Impact Statement:  Televisions and Computers.  The paper canvasses various options for managing end-of-life units and analyses the costs and benefits of each.  The Consultation Paper does not have a preferred option.  The preferred option will be developed by government through the public consultation process prior to the next meeting of the EPHC on 5 November 2009 in  where State and Federal Minister will adopt a position.\nA series of public meetings were held in , Perth,  and  to receive feedback to the government's proposals.  The meetings occurred in late July and early August 2009.\nIn November 2009 the National Waste Policy was agreed by governments across Australia and officially endorsed by the Council of Australian Governments in August 2010.  The  introduced new legislation and provided a framework for developing legislatively backed product stewardship for Australia. Shortly thereafter the National Television and Computer Recycling Scheme (NTCRS) was introduced, which mandated the first targets for electronics recycling in Australia.\nThe NTCRS has a strong focus on providing free access to the Australian public for e-waste recycling, with services being rolled out progressively across all Australian States in 2012/13. With an initial focus on televisions, computers and computer peripherals the NTCRS is aims to significantly increase recycling rates for electronics in Australia, from an estimated 17.00% in 2010 to 30.00% in 2012/13 and up to 80.00% by 2021/22.\nProduct Stewardship Australia (PSA) is a not-for-profit organisation established by the television industry to lead the way in developing recycling programs for e-waste in Australia, particularly televisions. PSA works closely with both state and federal governments along with other industry associations to advance  in Australia. PSA has contributed to the development of the .\n"},

Landfill gas (LFG) is generated by degradation of the biodegradable waste fraction, and is influenced by waste physicochemical composition and environmental variables. Studies have shown that the actual rate of gas production in a landfill is a function of waste composition (organic content), age (or time since placement), climate variables, moisture content, particle size, compaction and buffering capacity. LFG mainly consists of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and numerous trace components. Methane is the second most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas after CO2 and is responsible for approximately 40% of global warming over the past 150 years.  Further, for the past 25 years, global anthropogenic methane emissions have exceeded those from natural sources.  Emissions from landfill sites account for 30% of the total anthropogenic methane emissions in Europe, 34% of those in the US, and 10% of anthropogenic methane emissions worldwide. Landfill gas emissions are one of the largest anthropogenic sources of methane especially because of food waste.  Globally, if food waste couple be represented as its own country, it would be the third largest greenhouse gas emitter, behind China and the U.S.  It has become important to reduce food waste related emissions by distinguishing between waste arising at two different stages in the food system: pre-consumer waste (from the manufacturing, processing, distribution and retailing of food) and consumer waste (arising in households, after purchase). A distinction is also made between two different types of emission; embedded emissions (generated during the production of food that is wasted) and waste disposal (from the processes of disposing waste food).  \n"},

A  is a solid, , or  material that displays either a \u201cHazardous Characteristic\u201d or is specifically \u201clisted\u201d by name as a hazardous waste. There are four characteristics chemical wastes may have to be considered as hazardous. These are Ignitability, , Reactivity, and Toxicity. This type of hazardous waste must be categorized as to its identity, constituents, and hazards so that it may be safely handled and managed.  Chemical waste is a broad term and encompasses many types of materials. Consult the , Product Data Sheet or Label for a list of constituents. These sources should state whether this chemical waste is a waste that needs special disposal.\nIn the laboratory, chemical wastes are usually segregated on-site into appropriate waste , and disposed by a specialist contractor in order to meet safety, health, and legislative requirements.\nInnocuous aqueous waste (such as solutions of ) may be poured down the sink. Some chemicals are washed down with excess water.

The reason being, when combined acids with these type of compounds, violent  can occur possibly causing , and in some cases \n should be separated from , , , , and . This is because when combined  with these type of compounds, inflammable, and sometimes  compounds can occur.\nWhen disposing hazardous laboratory chemical waste, chemical compatibility must be considered. For safe disposal, the container must be chemically compatible with the material it will hold. Chemicals must not react with, weaken, or dissolve the container or lid.  or  should not be stored in .  should not store in .  () should not store or transport in lightweight  containers such as milk jugs. Moreover, the Chemical Compatibility Guidelines should be considered for more detailed information.\nPackaging, labelling, storage are the three requirements for disposing chemical waste.\nFor packaging, chemical liquid waste containers should only be filled up to 75% capacity to allow for  and to reduce potential spills which could occur from moving overfilled containers. Container material must be compatible with the stored  . Finally, wastes must not be packaged in containers that improperly identify other nonexisting hazards.\nIn addition to the general packaging requirements mentioned above, incompatible materials should never be mixed together in a single container. Wastes must be stored in containers compatible with the chemicals stored as mentioned in the container compatibility section.  safety cans should be used to collect and temporarily store large volumes (10\u201320 litres) of  organic waste , precipitates,  or other non-fluid wastes should not be mixed into safety cans.\nLabel all containers with the group name from the chemical waste category and an itemized list of the contents. All chemicals or anything contaminated with chemicals posing a significant hazard. All waste must be appropriately packaged.\nWhen storing chemical wastes, the containers must be in good condition and should remain closed unless waste is being added.  must be stored safely prior to removal from the laboratory and should not be allowed to accumulate. Container should be sturdy and leakproof, also has to be labeled. All liquid waste must be stored in leakproof containers with a screw- top or other secure lid. , mis-sized caps,  and other loose fitting lids are not acceptable. If necessary, transfer waste material to a container that can be securely closed. Keep waste containers closed except when adding waste. Secondary containment should be in place to capture spills and leaks from the primary container, segregate incompatible , such as  and .\n is a Geographic Information System (GIS) from the Division of Specialized Information Services of the  (NLM) that uses maps of the United States to help users visually explore data from the 's (EPA)   and .

There have been many studies conducted to try and prove the effects of chemicals in our oceans. In Canada, many of the studies concentrated on the Atlantic provinces, where fishing and aquaculture are an important part of the economy. \nIn New Brunswick, a study was done on the  in an attempt to identify the effects of toxic and chemical waste on life beneath the ocean, specifically the waste from salmon farms. Sea urchins were used to check the levels of metals in the environment. It is advantageous to use green sea urchins, , because they are widely distributed, abundant in many locations, and easily accessible. By investigating the concentrations of metals in the green sea urchins, the impacts of chemicals from  activity could be assessed and detected. Samples were taken at 25-metre intervals along a transect in the direction of the main tidal flow. The study found that there was impacts to at least 75\u00a0m based on the intestine metal concentrations. So based on this study it is clear that the metals are contaminating the ocean and negatively affecting aquatic life.\nAnother issue regarding chemical waste is the potential risk of surface and groundwater contamination by the heavy metals and  leached from uranium waste-rock piles (UWRP) A Radionuclide is an atom that has excess nuclear energy, making it unstable. Uranium waste-rock piles refers to , which is the process of extraction of uranium ore from the ground. An example of such threats is in Saskatchewan, Uranium mining and ore processing (milling) can pose a threat to the environment. In open pit mining, large amounts of materials are excavated and disposed of in waste-rock piles. Waste-rock piles from the  industry can contain several heavy metals and contaminants that may become mobile under certain conditions. Environmental contaminants may include , higher concentrations of radionuclides, and non-radioactive metals/metalloids (i.e. As, Mo, Ni, Cu, Zn).\nThe leachability of heavy metals and radionuclide from UWRP plays a significant role in determining their potential environmental risks to surrounding surface and groundwater. Substantial differences in the solid-phase partitioning and chemical leachability of Ni and U were observed in the investigated UWRP lithological materials and background organic-rich lake sediment. For Instance, in the uranium-mining district of Northern Saskatchewan, Canada, the sequential extraction results showed that a significant amount of Ni () was present in the non-labile residual fraction, while Uranium was mostly distributed in the moderately labile fractions. Although Nickel was much less labile than Uranium, the observed Nickel exceeded Uranium concentrations in . The observed Nickel and Uranium concentrations were relatively high in the underlying organic-rich lake sediment. Expressed as the percentage of total metal content, potential leachability decreased in the order U > Ni. Data suggest that these elements could potentially migrate to the water table below the UWRP. Detailed information regarding the solid-phase distribution of  in the UWRP is critical to understand the potential for their environmental transport and mobility.\nImage of Uranium risk map may be found here: \n\n"},

It may also include waste associated with the generation of biomedical waste that visually appears to be of medical or laboratory origin (e.g., packaging, unused bandages, infusion kits, etc.), as well research laboratory waste containing biomolecules or organisms that are mainly restricted from environmental release. As detailed below, discarded  are considered biomedical waste whether they are contaminated or not, due to the possibility of being contaminated with blood and their propensity to cause injury when not properly contained and disposed of. Biomedical waste is a type of biowaste.\nBiomedical waste may be solid or liquid. Examples of infectious waste include discarded , sharps, unwanted  and stocks, identifiable body parts (including those as a result of ), other human or animal tissue, used  and dressings, discarded gloves, other medical supplies that may have been in contact with blood and , and laboratory waste that exhibits the characteristics described above. Waste sharps include potentially contaminated used (and unused discarded) needles, , lancets and other devices capable of penetrating skin.\nBiomedical waste is generated from biological and medical sources and activities, such as the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of diseases. Common generators (or producers) of biomedical waste include , , , ,  , offices of , , and , , and  or . In healthcare facilities (i.e., hospitals, clinics, doctor's offices, veterinary hospitals and ), waste with these characteristics may alternatively be called medical or clinical waste.\nBiomedical waste is distinct from normal trash or general waste, and differs from other types of , such as chemical, radioactive, universal or . Medical facilities generate waste hazardous  and  materials. While such wastes are normally not infectious, they require proper disposal. Some wastes are considered  such as tissue samples preserved in .\nDisposal of this waste is an  concern, as many medical wastes are classified as  or  and could potentially lead to the spread of . The most common danger for humans is the infection which also affects other living organisms in the region. Daily exposure to the waste (landfill) leads to accumulation of harmful substances or microbes in the person's body.\nA 1990 report by the United State Country concluded that the general public is not likely to be adversely affected by biomedical waste generated in the traditional healthcare setting. They found, however, that biomedical waste from those settings may pose an injury and exposure risks via occupational contact with medical waste for doctors, nurses, and janitorial, laundry and refuse workers. Further, there are opportunities for the general public to come into contact medical waste, such as needles used illicitly outside healthcare settings, or biomedical waste generated via home health care.\nBiomedical waste must be properly managed and disposed of to protect the environment, general public and workers, especially healthcare and sanitation workers who are at risk of exposure to biomedical waste as an occupational hazard. Steps in the management of biomedical waste include generation, accumulation, handling, storage, treatment, transport and disposal.\nThe development and implementation of a national waste management policy can improve biomedical waste management in health facilities in a country\nDisposal occurs off-site, at a location that is different from the site of generation. Treatment may occur on-site or off-site. On-site treatment of large quantities of biomedical waste usually requires the use of relatively expensive equipment, and is generally only cost effective for very large hospitals and major universities who have the space, labour and budget to operate such equipment. Off-site treatment and disposal involves hiring of a biomedical waste disposal service (also called a truck service) whose employees are trained to collect and haul away biomedical waste in special containers (usually cardboard boxes, or reusable plastic bins) for treatment at a facility designed to handle biomedical waste.\nBiomedical waste should be collected in containers that are  and sufficiently strong to prevent breakage during handling. Containers of biomedical waste are marked with a  symbol. The container, marking, and labels are often red.\nDiscarded sharps are usually collected in specialized boxes, often called .\nSpecialized equipment is required to meet  29 CFR 1910.1450 and  40 CFR 264.173. standards of safety.  Minimal recommended equipment include a  and primary and secondary waste containers to capture potential overflow.  Even beneath the fume hood, containers containing chemical contaminants should remain closed when not in use.  An open funnel placed in the mouth of a waste container has been shown to allow significant evaporation of chemicals into the surrounding atmosphere, which is then inhaled by laboratory personnel, and contributes a primary component to the threat of completing the .  To protect the health and safety of laboratory staff as well as neighboring civilians and the environment, proper waste management equipment, such as the  in Europe and the  in the U.S., should be utilized in any department which deals with chemical waste. It is to be dumped after treatment.\nStorage refers to keeping the waste until it is treated on-site or transported off-site for treatment or disposal.  There are many options and containers for storage.  Regulatory agencies may limit the time for which waste can remain in storage.  Handling is the act of moving biomedical waste between the point of generation, accumulation areas, storage locations and on-site treatment facilities. Workers who handle biomedical waste must observe \nThe goals of biomedical waste treatment are to reduce or eliminate the waste's hazards, and usually to make the waste unrecognizable. Treatment should render the waste safe for subsequent handling and disposal. There are several treatment methods that can accomplish these goals.It include secregating the bio waste\nBiomedical waste is often . An efficient incinerator will destroy pathogens and sharps. Source materials are not recognizable in the resulting ash. Alternative thermal treatment can also include technologies such as gasification and pyrolysis including energy recovery with similar waste volume reductions and pathogen destruction. \u00a0\nAn  may also be used to treat biomedical waste. An autoclave uses steam and pressure to  the waste or reduce its microbiological load to a level at which it may be safely disposed of. Many healthcare facilities routinely use an autoclave to sterilize medical supplies. If the same autoclave is used to sterilize supplies and treat biomedical waste,  must be used to prevent the waste operations from contaminating the supplies. Effective administrative controls include operator training, strict procedures, and separate times and space for processing biomedical waste.\nMicrowave disinfection can also be employed for treatment of Biomedical wastes. Microwave irradiation is a type of non-contact heating technologies for disinfection. Microwave chemistry is based on efficient heating of materials by microwave dielectric heating effects. When exposed to microwave frequencies, the dipoles of the water molecules present in cells re-align with the applied electric field. As the field oscillates, the dipoles attempts to realign itself with the alternating electric field and in this process, energy is lost in the form of heat through molecular friction and dielectric loss. Microwave disinfection is a recently developed technology which provides advantage over old existing technologies of autoclaves as microwave based disinfection has less cycle time, power consumption and it requires minimal usage of water and consumables as compared to autoclaves.\nFor liquids and small quantities, a 1\u201310% solution of  can be used to disinfect biomedical waste. Solutions of sodium hydroxide and other chemical disinfectants may also be used, depending on the waste's characteristics. Other treatment methods include heat,  and the use of microwaves.\nFor autoclaves and microwave systems, a shredder may be used as a final treatment step to render the waste unrecognizable. Some autoclaves have built in shredders.\nIn the UK, clinical waste and the way it is to be handled is closely regulated. Applicable legislation includes the  (Part II), , and the , as well as the Special Waste Regulations in Scotland.  A scandal erupted in October 2018 when it emerged that , which had contracts for managing clinical waste produced by the NHS in Scotland and England, was in breach of the environmental permits at four of its six sites by having more waste on site than their permit allows and storing waste inappropriately.  17  in Yorkshire terminated their contracts immediately.  The company sued for compensation.  Amputated limbs were said to be among 350 tonnes of clinical waste stockpiled instead of incinerated in .  The company maintains that the problem is caused by a reduction in incineration capacity, and the re-classification of clinical waste as \u201coffensive\u201d, which meant more needed incineration. The government's contingency plans include installing temporary storage units at hospitals, but the company say that this is more dangerous than allowing them to exceed their permitted allowances.   The company still has contracts with 30 other trusts in England, and a waste disposal contract with NHS England for primary care and pharmacy.\nIn the United States, biomedical waste is usually regulated as medical waste. In 1988 the U.S. federal government passed The  which allowed the  to establish rules for management of medical waste in some parts of the country.  After the Act expired in 1991, responsibility to regulate and pass laws concerning the disposal of medical waste returned to the individual states.  The states vary in their regulations from none to very strict.\nIn addition to on-site treatment or pickup by a biomedical waste disposal firm for off-site treatment, a mail-back disposal option allows generators of waste to return it to the manufacturer.  For instance, waste medicines and equipment can be returned.  The waste is shipped through the U.S. postal service. While available in all 50 U.S. states, mail-back medical waste disposal is limited by very strict postal regulations (i.e., collection and shipping containers must be approved by the postal service for use).\nThe Bio-medical Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 1998 and further amendments were passed for the  regulation of bio-medical waste management. On 28 th Mar 2016 Biomedical Waste Management Rules 2016 were also notified by Central Govt. Each state's Pollution Control Board or Pollution control Committee will be responsible for implementing the new legislation.\nIn India, though there are a number of different disposal methods, the situation is desultory and most are harmful rather than helpful. If  are present, the material needs to be incinerated or put into an autoclave. Although this is the proper method, most medical facilities fail to follow the regulations. It is often found that biomedical waste is dumped into the ocean, where it eventually washes up on shore, or in landfills due to improper sorting or negligence when in the medical facility. Improper disposal can lead to many diseases in animals as well as humans. For example, animals, such as cows in , India, are consuming the infected waste and eventually, these infections can be transported to humans who  consume their meat or milk. Large number of unregistered clinics and institutions also generate bio-medical waste which is not controlled.\nDue to the competition to improve quality and so as to get accreditation from agencies like ISO, , , many private organizations have initiated proper bio-medical waste disposal but still the gap is huge.\nMany studies took place in , India regarding the knowledge of workers in facilities such as hospitals, nursing homes, or home health. It was found that 26% of doctors and 43% of paramedical staff were unaware of the risks related to biomedical wastes. After extensively looking at the different facilities, many were undeveloped in the area regarding biomedical waste. The rules and regulations in India work with The Bio-medical Waste (Management and Handling) Rules from 1998, yet a large number of health care facilities were found to be sorting the waste incorrectly.\nUpdating this article around 26 March 2020. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has been very stringent on the application of the BMW 2016 over the past 12 months. There are now over 200 licensed Common Bio Medical Waste Treatment and Disposal Facilities (CBWTDF) or Common Treatment Facility (CTF) in the country. The rules have been updated over the years. You can find the BMW 2016 act and the subsequent amendments at this site \"\". The training of Health Care Facility staff and the awareness of the Hazards of Bio Medical waste is still a challenge in most of the country. The compliance is being enforced through penalties and via awareness. The CTF are operational in most Tier 1 cities and Tier 2 cities of India and compliance is high today because of NGT. But lack of awareness lead to issues of improper segregation. In Tier 2 and 3 cities the general waste is also mixed with Bio Medical waste.\nThe latest guidelines for segregation of bio-medical waste recommend the following color coding:\nThe  environmental disaster of 1987\u20131988 raised awareness about medical waste as medical syringes washed ashore in Connecticut, New Jersey, and New York. A similar situation occurred in 2013 at Island Beach State Park in New Jersey, and brought about the Floatables Action Plan. The syringes endangered marine species and posed a threat to humans who visited the beach. The crises spurred scientists and lawmakers to create mechanisms, policies, and laws so that health care providers would process their bio-waste in an environmentally friendly way.\nImproper management of health care waste can have both direct and indirect health consequences for health personnel, community members and on the environment. Indirect consequences in the form of toxic emissions from inadequate burning of medical waste, or the production of millions of used syringes in a period of three to four weeks from an insufficiently well planned mass immunization campaign.\nBiomedical waste is not limited to medical instruments; it includes medicine, waste stored in red biohazard bags, and materials used for patient care, such as cotton and bandaids. The most serious effect that biomedical waste has on our seas is the discharge of poisons into the waters that could then be consumed by ocean life creatures. Toxins would interject into the food chain and eventually reach humans who consume sea creatures. Human exposure to such toxins can stunt human growth development and cause birth defects.\nThe high volume of plastic use in the medical field also poses a dangerous threat to the environment. According to North and Halden, 85% of disposable plastic materials make up all medical equipment. Our current reliance on plastic materials is rooted in their unique capabilities to be lightweight, cost-effective, and durable while preserving the sterility of medical equipment. In addition to the serious health implications of releasing harmful toxins in the environment from medical waste deposits, introducing this volume of single-use plastics can catalyze the compounding health detriments caused by macro and microplastics.\nThe three type of medical waste incinerators are controlled air, excess air, and . Controlled air is also known as starved-air incineration, two-stage incineration, or modular combustion. This is the process of which waste is fed to a combustion chamber and combustion air begins to dry and facilitates volatilization of the waste. As a result,  and other excess gases are released into the atmosphere.\nThe second type of incineration is the excess air process. This is similar to the controlled air process, such as the waste being dried, ignited, and combusted by heat provided by the primary chamber burner. However, the main difference is that moisture and volatile components in the waste are vaporized.\nIn a rotary kiln, the process is similar to the two mention above, however, it is more versatile in terms of being able to mix wet and dry waste components and viewed by many waste engineers as being the most environmentally friendly.\nPost incineration process, toxic  residue is produced and is often disposed at . These landfills are not protected by any barrier and the residue has the potential of reaching  that is often exposed to human use. The combustion of  material releases toxic gases that escapes and joins breathable air. Human and animal exposure to such gases can cause long term breathing and health issues. The rotation of toxic air does not only impact human well-being, but also of animals and plants.  caused by the incinerators depletes the , causes crop and forest damage, and increases . Constant exposure to such toxins and chemicals in the air could be deemed detrimental to trees and plants could eventually lead to extinction of certain plants in specific areas. Pollution and chemical leaks also effect the fruits of trees and would cause them to be poisonous and therefore, inedible.\nCalifornia created the Medical Waste Management Program (Program), which regulates the generation, handling, storage, treatment, and disposal of medical waste by providing oversight for the implementation of the Medical Waste Management Act. Precautions have been taken in California which permits and inspects all medical waste offsite treatment facilities and medical waste transfer stations. In order to dispose waste, the department recommends the following process to make controlled substance waste nonretrievable. Pills containing a controlled substance are crushed before placing the residue into a pharmaceutical waste container.  Controlled substance that is remaining in a syringe is wasted into a pharmaceutical waste container before disposing of the syringe in a sharps container.  Expired medications should be returned through a reverse distributor.\nReusable RMW or sharps containers reduce the amount of plastic sent to landfills and CO2 emissions.\nNon-incineration treatment includes four basic processes: thermal, chemical, irradiative, and biological. The main purpose of the treatment technology is to  waste by destroying . Modern technology invented mechanics that would allow medical professionals and hospitals to dispose medical waste in an environmentally friendly way; such as: , , , chemical methods, and . These alternatives are also highly versatile and can be used for all different types of waste.\nAn autoclave, similar to a pressure cooker, uses high-temperature steam to penetrate waste material and kill micro-organisms. Autoclave treatment has been recommended for microbiology and biotechnology waste, waste sharps, soiled and solid wastes. Microwave irradiation is based on the principle of generation of high frequency waves. These waves cause the particles within the waste material to vibrate, generating heat and killing the pathogens from within. A simple yet effective method is : 1%  can kill thriving bacteria. Plasma pyrolysis is an environment-friendly mechanism, which converts organic waste into commercially useful byproducts. The intense heat generated by the plasma enables it to dispose all types of waste including , biomedical waste and  in a safe and reliable manner. Gasification can offer carbon sequestration and energy generation, reducing the carbon footprint of biomedical waste treatment.\nInitiative from corporations and hospitals is essential to creating a healthier environment, however, there are various methods in which involves action from the general population and would contribute to a clean air environment. By creating surveillance groups within hospitals, everyone would be held accountable for misconduct and improper disposal of waste. Consequences could be implemented where individuals would be required to pay a fine, or face unpaid suspension from work. Companies and governmental organization should also initiate non-routine checkups and searches, this would place pressure on hospitals to ensure that waste is properly disposed all year round. Voluntary clean-ups would involve hospital staff in assuring that medical waste is not littered around the hospital or thrown into regular garbage bins.\n"},

Application of slurries to land overlying  can result in direct contamination or, more commonly, elevation of nitrogen levels as  or nitrate.\nThe disposal of any wastewater containing animal waste upstream of a drinking water intake can pose serious health problems to those drinking the water because of the highly resistant spores present in many animals that are capable of causing disabling disease in humans. This risk exists even for very low-level seepage via shallow surface drains or from rainfall run-off.\nSome animal slurries are treated by mixing with straws and  at high temperature to produce a bacteriologically sterile and friable manure for soil improvement.\nPiggery waste is comparable to other animal wastes and is processed as for general animal waste, except that many piggery wastes contain elevated levels of  that can be toxic in the natural environment.

The production of silage often involves the use of an acid conditioner such as  or . The process of silage making frequently produces a yellow-brown strongly smelling liquid which is very rich in simple , , short-chain organic acids and silage conditioner. This liquor is one of the most polluting organic substances known. The volume of silage liquor produced is generally in proportion to the moisture content of the ensiled material.\nSilage liquor is best treated through prevention by wilting crops well before silage making. Any silage liquor that is produced can be used as part of the food for pigs.\nThe most effective treatment is by containment in a slurry lagoon and by subsequent spreading on land following substantial dilution with slurry. Containment of silage liquor on its own can cause structural problems in concrete pits because of the acidic nature of silage liquor.\nAlthough milk is an important food product, its presence in wastewaters is highly polluting because of its organic strength, which can lead to very rapid  of receiving waters.  wastes also contain large volumes of wash-down water, some animal waste together with cleaning and  chemicals.\nMilking parlour wastes are often treated in  with human sewage in a local  plant. This ensures that disinfectants and cleaning agents are sufficiently diluted and amenable to treatment. Running milking wastewaters into a farm slurry lagoon is a possible option although this tends to consume lagoon capacity very quickly. Land spreading is also a treatment option. \nWastewater from slaughtering activities is similar to milking parlour waste (see above) although considerably stronger in its organic composition and therefore potentially much more polluting.\nAs for milking parlour waste (see above).\nWashing of  produces large volumes of water contaminated by soil and vegetable pieces.

This report started a paradigm shift in which global actors soon began to engage in initiatives that vowed to focus on sustainable development.\nFive years after the report was launched the UN Earth\u2019s Summitt in Rio adopted the . Five years later this policy developed into the creation of the , a plan in which rich nations pledged to reduce . All countries that partook in the UNFCCC also signed onto the Kyoto Protocol. Unfortunately progress towards sustainability stalled when the Kyoto Protocol was never ratified by the United States, and other nations consequently ignored their pledges to the agreement.\nRecently, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a report that says \u201curgent and unprecedented changes are needed to reach the target\u201d of keeping the global temperature at moderate levels. They state that countries MUST follow the  pledge to keep temperatures between 1.5 degrees Celsius and 2 degrees Celsius, otherwise the earth faces the complete eradication of corals and the melting of the . The Panel continues to explain that a rise in temperatures would also trigger catastrophic results in the form of intense , unpredictable weather, and food shortages. \u00a0In order to prevent this outcome governments would need to require a \u201csupercharged roll-back of emissions courses that have built up over the past 250 years.\u201d In order to do so developments in land use and technological changes are necessary. Carbon  would have to be cut by 45% by 2030 and come down to 0 by 2050. Although this would require carbon prices to be three to four times higher, the consequences of  at this rate would be far more severe. The world is currently on course to reaching 3 degrees Celsius of global warming, and scientists have 12 years to impose significant changes to prevent this from happening. This shift towards  demands for a workforce that is more heavily dedicated to studying sustainable development. Individuals studying sustainable development will likely be focused on reducing the climate in which catastrophic global warming would take place.\nSustainability studies is a degree which emphasizes an interdisciplinary approach. Since it covers a wide variety of topics from multiple perspectives, it can lead into multiple avenues for a future career such as:\nThe salary range for a professional involved in sustainability studies is based on the average salaries of those involved in  and . This starting salary ranged from 75 000 on the low end, to 93 000. Chief sustainability executives can earn an average of 167 000.\n"},

This new field of science was officially introduced with a \"Birth Statement\" at the World Congress \"Challenges of a Changing Earth 2001\" in Amsterdam organized by the  (ICSU), the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (), the  and the  (WCRP). \nThe field reflects a desire to give the generalities and broad-based approach of \"\" a stronger analytic and scientific underpinning as it \"brings together scholarship and practice, global and local perspectives from north and south, and disciplines across the natural and social sciences, engineering, and medicine\". Ecologist  proposes that it can be usefully thought of as \"neither 'basic' nor 'applied' research but as a field defined by the problems it addresses rather than by the disciplines it employs\" and that it \"serves the need for advancing both knowledge and action by creating a dynamic bridge between the two\".\nThe field is focused on examining the interactions between human, environmental, and engineered systems to understand and contribute to solutions for complex challenges that threaten the future of humanity and the integrity of the life support systems of the planet, such as climate change, , pollution and land and water degradation.\nSustainability science, like  itself, derives some impetus from the concepts of  and . Sustainability science provides a critical framework for sustainability while  provides the evidence-based quantitative data needed to guide .\nConsensual definition of sustainability science is as elusive as the definition of \"sustainability\" or \"sustainable development\". In an overview presented on its website in 2008 the Sustainability Science Program at  described the field in the following way, stressing its :\n'Sustainability science' is problem-driven, interdisciplinary scholarship that seeks to facilitate the design, implementation, and evaluation of effective interventions that foster shared prosperity and reduced poverty while protecting the environment. It is defined by the problems it addresses rather than the disciplines it employs. It thus draws as needed from multiple disciplines of the natural, social, medical and engineering sciences, from the professions, and from the knowledge of practice. and colleagues, in 2003, suggested, more specifically, that sustainability science is: \n...\u00a0the cultivation, integration, and application of knowledge about Earth systems gained especially from the holistic and historical sciences (such as geology, ecology, climatology, oceanography) coordinated with knowledge about human interrelationships gained from the social sciences and humanities, in order to evaluate, mitigate, and minimize the consequences, regionally and worldwide, of human impacts on planetary systems and on societies across the globe and into the future\u00a0\u2013 that is, in order that humans can be knowledgeable Earth stewards.\nIt has been noted that the new paradigm ...\u00a0must encompass different magnitudes of scales (of time, space, and function), multiple balances (dynamics), multiple actors (interests) and multiple failures (systemic faults).Others take a much broader view of sustainability science, emphasizing the need to analyze the root causes of the fundamental unsustainability of the prevailing economic system, such as the emphasis on growth as key to solving political and social problems and advancing society's well-being. In a 2012 article entitled \"Sustainability Science Needs to Include Sustainable Consumption,\" published in Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development, Halina Brown argues that sustainability science must include the study of the sociology of material consumption and the structure of consumerist society, the role of technology in aggravating the unsustainable social practices, as well as in solving the problems they create, the macroeconomic theories that presuppose economic growth as a necessary condition for advancing societal well-being, and others.\nThe case for making research and development an important component of sustainable development strategies was embraced by many international scientific organizations in the mid-1980s, promoted by the Brundtland Commission's report  in 1987, and noted in the  plan that emerged from the  in 1992 and further developed at the , held in Johannesburg in 2002.\nThe topics of the following sub-headings indicate recurring themes that are addressed in the literature of sustainability science. In 2010 a compendium of basic papers in this new discipline was published as , edited by , with a preface by William Clark. The 2012 Commentary by Halina Brown extensively expands the scope of that seminal publication. This is work in progress. The 2012 Encyclopedia of Sustainability Science and Technology was created as a collaboration of over 1000 scientists to provide peer-reviewed entries covering sustainability research and policy evaluations of technology.\nKnowledge structuring has been identified as an essential first step in the effort to acquire a comprehensive view of sustainability issues which are both complex and interconnected. This is needed as a response to the requirements of academia, industry and government.\nThe key research and data for sustainability are sourced from many scientific disciplines, topics and organisations. A major part of knowledge structuring will entail building up the tools that provide an \"overview\" of what is known. Sustainability science can construct and coordinate a framework within which the vast amount of data can be easily accessed.\nThe attempt, by sustainability science, to understand the integrated \"whole\" of planetary and human systems requires cooperation between scientific, social and economic disciplines, public and private sectors, academia and government. In short it requires a massive global cooperative effort and one major task of sustainability science is to assist integrated cross-disciplinary coordination.\n\n is the study of the Earth and all fields of Earth sciences. Geoscience is a broad term that includes various disciplines such as: , , , , and . \nGeologists are very crucial to the sustainability movement. They hold a special knowledge and deep understanding of how Earth recycles and maintains the sustainability of itself. To gain a better understanding of how sustainability and geology are closely related, there is the definition: the notable changes in geologic processes that land between how Earth was before humans existed and currently exist. Therefore, the relationship between these two sciences is not a new idea but also an old concept. They are very similar in that they have many limitations due to gradual changes. However, there is an issue between this relationship. Geologists don\u2019t always find themselves centered with sustainable thoughts. One of the reasons for this is that many geologists can\u2019t agree on the issue with the Anthropocene Epoch debate which focuses on how humans can adapt to the environmental changes in comparison to how these changes are neglected. Regardless of Geologists not always finding themselves centered with this thinking, society has made an effort to link the two by creating Sustainable Development Goals. These goals however, do not overlap with many of the jobs that geologists perform. \nGeology is a science that is critical in understanding many of modern societies environmental challenges. This science is important to understand because it has a major role to play in deciding if humans can live sustainably on Earth. Having a lot to do with energy, water, climate change, and natural hazards, geology can be used to interpret and solve a wide variety of problems.  However, few geologists make any contributions towards a more sustainable future. Many geologists end up working for oil and gas or mining companies which are typically not focused on sustainability. In order to be more sustainably minded, geologists must collaborate with many and all types of Earth sciences. For example, if geologists collaborated with sciences like ecology, zoology, physical geography, biology, and environmental sciences as well as engineers they could gain a better understanding of the impact their work could have on the environment. By working with more fields of study and broadening their knowledge of the environment geologists and their work could be more environmentally conscious. \nTo ensure that sustainability and geology can maintain their relationship, it is essential that schools globally make an effort to add geology into curriculum . and society incorporates the international development goals. A misconception many people have is that geology is the study of rocks however it is much more complex. Geology is the study of the Earth, how Earth works, and what it means for life on Earth. Understanding the Earth and its natural processes opens many doors for understanding how humans affect the Earth and ways to protect it. In order to allow more people to understand this field of study, more schools must begin to advertise this known information. When more people hold this knowledge, it will then be easier to incorporate the international development goals and continue to better the Earth\nIn recent years, more and more university degree programs have developed formal curricula which address issues of sustainability science and global change:\n"},

The SDGs, set in 2015 by the  and intended to be achieved by the year 2030, are part of UN  70/1, the 2030 Agenda.\nThe Sustainable Development Goals are: \nThe goals are broad based and interdependent. The 17 sustainable development goals each has a list of targets which are  with indicators. In an effort to make the SDGs successful, data on the 17 goals has been made available in an easily-understood form. A variety of tools exist to track and visualize progress towards the goals.\nIn 1972, governments met in Stockholm, Sweden for the , to consider the rights of the family to a healthy and productive environment. In 1983, the United Nations created the  (later known as the Brundtland Commission), which defined sustainable development as \"meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs\". In 1992, the first  (UNCED) or Earth Summit was held in , where the first agenda for Environment and Development, also known as , was developed and adopted.\nIn 2012, the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (UNCSD), also known as , was held as a 20-year follow up to UNCED. Colombia proposed the idea of the SDGs at a preparation event for Rio+20 held in Indonesia in July 2011. In September 2011, this idea was picked up by the  64th NGO Conference in Bonn, Germany. The outcome document proposed 17 sustainable development goals and associated targets. In the run-up to Rio+20 there was much discussion about the idea of the SDGs. At the Rio+20 Conference, a resolution known as \"The Future We Want\" was reached by member states. Among the key themes agreed on were poverty eradication, energy, water and sanitation, health, and human settlement.\nThe Rio+20 outcome document mentioned that \"at the outset, the OWG [Open Working Group] will decide on its methods of work, including developing modalities to ensure the full involvement of relevant stakeholders and expertise from civil society, Indigenous Peoples, the scientific community and the United Nations system in its work, in order to provide a diversity of perspectives and experience\".\nIn January 2013, the 30-member UN General Assembly Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals was established to identify specific goals for the SDGs. The Open Working Group (OWG) was tasked with preparing a proposal on the SDGs for consideration during the 68th session of the General Assembly, September 2013 \u2013 September 2014. On 19 July 2014, the OWG forwarded a proposal for the SDGs to the Assembly. After 13 sessions, the OWG submitted their proposal of 8 SDGs and 169 targets to the 68th session of the General Assembly in September 2014. On 5 December 2014, the UN General Assembly accepted the 's Synthesis Report, which stated that the agenda for the post-2015 SDG process would be based on the OWG proposals.\n, the  from 2007 to 2016, has stated in a November 2016 press conference that: \"We don\u2019t have plan B because there is no planet B.\" This thought has guided the development of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\nThe  was a process from 2012 to 2015 led by the  to define the future global development framework that would succeed the . The SDGs were developed to succeed the  (MDGs) which ended in 2015. The gaps and shortcomings of MDG Goal 8 (To develop a global partnership for development) led to identifying a problematic \"donor-recipient\" relationship. Instead, the new SDGs favor collective action by all countries.\nThe UN-led process involved its 193  and global . The resolution is a broad intergovernmental agreement that acts as the . The SDGs build on the principles agreed upon in Resolution A/RES/66/288, entitled \"The Future We Want\". This was a non-binding document released as a result of  held in 2012.\nNegotiations on the  began in January 2015 and ended in August 2015. The negotiations ran in parallel to United Nations negotiations on financing for development, which determined the financial means of implementing the ; those negotiations resulted in adoption of the  in July 2015. A final document was adopted at the UN Sustainable Development Summit in September 2015 in .\nOn 25 September 2015, the 193 countries of the UN General Assembly adopted the 2030 Development Agenda titled \"Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\". This agenda has 92 paragraphs. Paragraph 59 outlines the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and the associated 169 targets and 232 indicators.\nThere are 169 targets for the 17 goals. Each target has between 1 and 3 indicators used to measure progress toward reaching the targets. In total, there are 232 approved indicators that will measure compliance. The  has been asked to provide easy to understand lists of targets, facts and figures for each of the 17 SDGs. The 17 goals listed below as sub-headings use the 2-to-4 word phrases that identify each goal. Directly below each goal, in quotation marks, is the exact wording of the goal in one sentence. The paragraphs that follow present some information about a few targets and indicators related to each goal.\n has been cut by more than half since 1990. Still, around 1 in 10 people live on less than the target figure of 1.25 per day. A very low poverty threshold is justified by highlighting the need of those people who are worst off. SDG 1 is to end extreme poverty globally by 2030.\nThat target may not be adequate for human  and basic needs, however. It is for this reason that changes relative to higher poverty lines are also commonly tracked. Poverty is more than the lack of income or resources: People live in poverty if they lack basic services such as healthcare, security, and education. They also experience hunger, social , and exclusion from decision-making processes. One possible alternative metric is the .\nChildren make up the majority \u2013 more than half \u2013 of those living in extreme poverty. In 2013, an estimated 385 million children lived on less than US$1.90 per day. Still, these figures are unreliable due to huge gaps in data on the status of children worldwide. On average, 97 percent of countries have insufficient data to determine the state of impoverished children and make projections towards SDG Goal 1, and 63 percent of countries have no data on child poverty at all.\nWomen face potentially life-threatening risks from early  and frequent pregnancies. This can result in lost hope for an education and for a better income. Poverty affects age groups differently, with the most devastating effects experienced by children. It affects their education, health, nutrition, and security, impacting emotional and spiritual development.\nAchieving Goal 1 is hampered by lack of economic growth in the poorest countries of the world, growing inequality, increasingly , and the impacts of .\nGoal 2 states that by 2030 we should end hunger and all forms of malnutrition. This would be accomplished by doubling agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers (especially women and indigenous peoples), by ensuring , and by progressively improving land and soil quality. Agriculture is the single largest employer in the world, providing livelihoods for 40% of the global population. It is the largest source of income for poor rural households. Women make up about 43% of the agricultural labor force in , and over 50% in parts of Asia and Africa. However, women own only 20% of the land.\nOther targets deal with maintaining genetic diversity of seeds, increasing access to land, preventing trade restriction and distortions in world agricultural markets to limit extreme food price volatility, eliminating waste with help from the International Food Waste Coalition, and ending malnutrition and undernutrition of children.\nGlobally, 1 in 9 people are undernourished, the vast majority of whom live in developing countries. Undernutrition causes wasting or severe wasting of 52 million children worldwide, and contributes to nearly half (45%) of deaths in children under five \u2013 3.1 million children per year. Chronic malnutrition, which affects an estimated 155 million children worldwide, also stunts children's brain and physical development and puts them at further risk of death, disease, and lack of success as adults. As of 2017, only 26 of 202 UN member countries are on track to meet the SDG target to eliminate undernourishment and malnourishment, while 20 percent have made no progress at all and nearly 70 percent have no or insufficient data to determine their progress.\nA report by the  (IFPRI) of 2013 stated that the emphasis of the SDGs should not be on ending poverty by 2030, but on eliminating hunger and under-nutrition by 2025. The assertion is based on an analysis of experiences in China, Vietnam, Brazil, and Thailand. Three pathways to achieve this were identified: 1) agriculture-led; 2) social protection- and nutrition- intervention-led; or 3) a combination of both of these approaches.\nA study published in  concluded that it is unlikely there will be an end to  by 2030.\nSignificant strides have been made in increasing life expectancy and reducing some of the common killers associated with  and . Between 2000 and 2016, the worldwide under-five mortality rate decreased by 47 percent (from 78 deaths per 1,000 live births to 41 deaths per 1,000 live births). Still, the number of children dying under age five is extremely high: 5.6 million in 2016 alone. Newborns account for a growing number of these deaths, and poorer children are at the greatest risk of under-5 mortality due to a number of factors. SDG Goal 3 aims to reduce under-five mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births. But if current trends continue, more than 60 countries will miss the SDG neonatal mortality target for 2030. About half of these countries would not reach the target even by 2050.\nGoal 3 also aims to reduce maternal mortality to less than 70 deaths per 100,000 live births. Though the maternal mortality ratio declined by 37 percent between 2000 and 2015, there were approximately 303,000 maternal deaths worldwide in 2015, most from preventable causes. In 2015, maternal health conditions were also the leading cause of death among girls aged 15\u201319. Data for girls of greatest concern \u2013 those aged between 10-14 - is currently unavailable. Key strategies for meeting SDG Goal 3 will be to reduce adolescent pregnancy (which is strongly linked to gender equality), provide better data for all women and girls, and achieve universal coverage of skilled birth attendants.\nSimilarly, progress has been made on increasing access to clean water and sanitation and on reducing , , , and the spread of .  From 2000\u20132016, new HIV infections declined by 66 percent for children under 15 and by 45 percent among adolescents aged 15\u201319. However, current trends mean that 1 out of 4 countries still won't meet the SDG target to end AIDS among children under 5, and 3 out of 4 will not meet the target to end AIDS among adolescents.  Additionally, only half of women in developing countries have received the health care they need, and the need for  is increasing exponentially as the population grows. While needs are being addressed gradually, more than 225 million women have an unmet need for .\nGoal 3 aims to achieve universal health coverage, including access to essential medicines and vaccines. It proposes to end the preventable death of newborns and children under 5 and to end epidemics such as AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and water-borne diseases, for example. 2016 rates for the third dose of the pertussis vaccine (DTP3) and the first dose of the  (MCV1) reached 86 percent and 85 percent, respectively. Yet about 20 million children did not receive DTP3 and about 21 million did not receive MCV1. Around 2 in 5 countries will need to accelerate progress in order to reach SDG targets for immunization.\nAttention to health and well-being also includes targets related to the prevention and treatment of , deaths and injuries from  and from hazardous chemicals and air,  and soil pollution and contamination.\nMajor progress has been made in access to education, specifically at the  level, for both boys and girls. The number of out-of-school children has almost halved from 112 million in 1997 to 60 million in 2014. Still, at least 22 million children in 43 countries will miss out on pre-primary education unless the rate of progress doubles.\nAccess does not always mean quality of education or completion of primary school. 103 million youth worldwide still lack basic literacy skills, and more than 60 percent of those are women.  In one out of four countries, more than half of children failed to meet minimum math proficiency standards at the end of primary school, and at the lower secondary level, the rate was 1 in 3 countries. Target 1 of Goal 4 is to ensure that, by 2030, all girls and boys complete free, equitable, and quality primary and secondary education.\nAdditionally, progress is difficult to track: 75 percent of countries have no or insufficient data to track progress towards SDG Goal 4 targets for learning outcomes (target 1), early childhood education (target 2), and effective learning environments. Data on learning outcomes and pre-primary school are particularly scarce; 70 percent and 40 percent of countries lack adequate data for these targets, respectively. This makes it hard to analyze and identify the children at greatest risk of being left behind. A 2019 study used computer modeling to estimate educational attainment for men and women from 2000\u20132017, mapping the results for each country to help identify areas lagging behind.\nAccording to the UN, \"gender equality is not only a fundamental human right, but a necessary foundation for a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable world.\" Providing women and girls with equal access to education, health care, decent work, and representation in political and economic decision-making processes will nurture sustainable economies and benefit societies and humanity at large. A record 143 countries guaranteed equality between men and women in their constitutions as of 2014. However, another 52 had not taken this step. In many nations, gender discrimination is still woven into the fabric of legal systems and social norms. Even though SDG5 is a stand-alone goal, other SDGs can only be achieved if the needs of women receive the same attention as the needs of men. Issues unique to women and girls include traditional practices against all women and girls in the public and private spheres, such as female genital mutilation.\n has declined over the past decades, yet there is no region that is currently on track to eliminate the practice and reach SDG targets by 2030. If current trends continue, between 2017 and 2030, 150 million girls will be married before they turn 18. Though child marriages are four times higher among the poorest than the wealthiest in the world, most countries need to accelerate progress among both groups in order to reach the SDG Goal 5 target to eliminate child marriage by 2030.\nAchieving gender equality will require enforceable legislation that promotes empowerment of all women and girls and requires secondary education for all girls. The targets call for an end to gender discrimination and for empowering women and girls through technology Some have advocated for \"listening to girls\". The assertion is that the SDGs can deliver transformative change for girls only if girls are consulted. Their priorities and needs must be taken into account. Girls should be viewed not as beneficiaries of change, but as agents of change. Engaging women and girls in the implementation of the SDGs is crucial.\nThe  has insisted on the transformational role  that boards can play in that regard, predicting that 2018 could be a pivotal year, as \"more than ever before, many UK and European Union  speak enthusiastically about flexing their  muscles for the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals, including SDG5, and to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.\"\nThe  (SDG6) has eight targets and 11 indicators that will be used to monitor progress toward the targets. Most are to be achieved by the year 2030. One is targeted for 2020.\nThe first three targets relate to drinking  and . Worldwide, 6 out of 10 people lack safely managed sanitation services, and 3 out of 10 lack safely managed  services. Safe drinking  and hygienic  protect people from disease and enable societies to be more productive economically. Attending school and work without disruption is critical to successful education and successful employment. Therefore, toilets in schools and work places are specifically mentioned as a target to measure. \"Equitable sanitation\" calls for addressing the specific needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations, such as the elderly or people with disabilities. Water sources are better preserved if open defecation is ended and sustainable sanitation systems are implemented.\nEnding  will require provision of toilets and sanitation for 2.6 billion people as well as  of the users. This will require cooperation between governments, civil society, and the private sector.\nThe main indicator for the sanitation target is the \"Proportion of population using safely managed sanitation services, including a hand-washing facility with soap and water\". However, as of 2017, two-thirds of countries lacked baseline estimates for SDG indicators on hand washing, safely managed drinking water, and sanitation services. From those that were available, the Joint Monitoring Programme () found that 4.5 billion people currently do not have . To meet SDG targets for sanitation by 2030, nearly one-third of countries will need to accelerate progress to end open defecation, including Brazil, China, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Pakistan.\nThe  (SuSanA) has made it its mission to achieve SDG6. SuSanA's position is that the SDGs are highly interdependent. Therefore, the provision of clean water and sanitation for all is a precursor to achieving many of the other SDGs.\nTargets for 2030 include access to affordable and reliable energy while increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix. This would involve improving energy efficiency and enhancing international cooperation to facilitate more open access to clean energy technology and more investment in clean energy infrastructure. Plans call for particular attention to infrastructure support for the ,  and land-locked .\nAs of 2017, only 57 percent of the global population relies primarily on clean fuels and technology for cooking, falling short of the 95 percent target.\n development economists have argued that the twin considerations of long-term economic growth and infrastructure investment were not prioritized enough. The fact they were designated as the number 8 and number 9 objective respectively was considered a rather \"mediocre ranking [which] defies common sense\".\nFor the least developed countries, the economic target is to attain at least a 7 percent annual growth in gross domestic product (GDP). Achieving higher productivity will require diversification and upgraded technology along with innovation, entrepreneurship, and the growth of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Some targets are for 2030; others are for 2020. The target for 2020 is to reduce youth unemployment and operationalize a global strategy for youth employment. Implementing the Global Jobs Pact of the  is also mentioned.\nBy 2030, the target is to establish policies for sustainable tourism that will create jobs. Strengthening domestic financial institutions and increasing Aid for Trade support for developing countries is considered essential to economic development. The Enhanced Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical Assistance to Least Developed Countries is mentioned as a method for achieving sustainable economic development.\nManufacturing is a major source of employment. In 2016, the least developed countries had less \"manufacturing value added per capita\". The figure for Europe and North America amounted to US$4,621, compared to about $100 in the least developed countries. The manufacturing of high products contributes 80 percent to total manufacturing output in industrialized economies but barely 10 percent in the least developed countries.\nMobile-cellular signal coverage has improved a great deal. In previously \"unconnected\" areas of the globe, 85 percent of people now live in covered areas. Planet-wide, 95 percent of the population is covered.\nTarget 10.1 is to \"sustain income growth of the bottom 40 per cent of the population at a rate higher than the national average\". This goal, known as 'shared prosperity', is complementing SDG 1, the eradication of extreme poverty, and it is relevant for all countries in the world.\nTarget 10.3 is to reduce the transaction costs for migrant remittances to below 3 percent. The target of 3 percent was established as the cost that international migrant workers would pay to send money home (known as ). However, post offices and money transfer companies currently charge 6 percent of the amount remitted. Worse, commercial banks charge 11 percent. Prepaid cards and mobile money companies charge 2 to 4 percent, but those services were not widely available as of 2017 in typical \"remittance corridors.\"\nThe target for 2030 is to ensure access to safe and . The indicator named to measure progress toward this target is the proportion of urban population living in  or . Between 2000 and 2014, the proportion fell from 39 percent to 30 percent. However, the absolute number of people living in slums went from 792 million in 2000 to an estimated 880 million in 2014. Movement from rural to urban areas has accelerated as the population has grown and better housing alternatives are available.\nThe targets of Goal 12 include using  production methods and reducing the amount of waste. By 2030, national  rates should increase, as measured in tons of material recycled. Further, companies should adopt sustainable practices and publish sustainability reports.\nTarget 12.1 calls for the implementation of the 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production. This framework, adopted by member states at the , is a global commitment to accelerate the shift to sustainable consumption and production in developed and developing countries. In order to generate the collective impact necessary for such a shift, programs such as the  have formed different implementation methods to help achieve Goal 12.\nThe UN discussions and negotiations identified the links between the post-2015 SDG process and the  process that concluded in Addis Ababa in July 2015 and the  Climate Change conference in Paris in December 2015.\nIn May 2015, a report concluded that only a very ambitious climate deal in Paris in 2015 could enable countries to reach the sustainable development goals and targets.\nThe report also states that tackling climate change will only be possible if the SDGs are met. Further, economic development and climate change are inextricably linked, particularly around , , and energy. The UN encourages the  to take initiative in this effort to minimize .\nThis renewed emphasis on climate change mitigation was made possible by the partial  convergence that developed in 2015\u20132016, notably at the UN  summit (Paris) and ensuing  conference (Hangzhou).\nAt a 2017 UN Press Briefing, Global CEO Alliance (GCEOA) Chairman James Donovan described the Asia-Pacific region, which is a region particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, as needing more  (PPPs) to successfully implement its sustainable development initiatives.\nIn 2018, the International Panel of Climate Change (IPCC), the United Nations body for assessing the science related to climate change, published a special report \" It outlined the impacts of a 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C global temperature rise above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways, and highlighted the possibility of avoiding a number of such impacts by limiting global warming to 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C compared to 2\u00a0\u00b0C, or more. The report mentioned that this would require global net human-caused emissions of  to fall by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, reaching \"net zero\" around 2050, through \u201crapid and far-reaching\u201d transitions in land, energy, industry, buildings, transport, and cities. This special report was subsequently discussed at . Despite being requested by countries at the , the report was not accepted by four countries \u2013 the US, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Kuwait, which only wanted to \"note\" it, thereby postponing the resolution to the next  session in 2019.\nSustainable Development Goal 14 aims \u201cto conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development.\u201d Effective strategies to mitigate adverse effects of increased  are needed to advance the sustainable use of oceans. As areas of protected  expand, there has been an increase in ocean science funding, essential for preserving . The deterioration of coastal waters has become a global occurrence, due to  and coastal eutrophication (overflow of nutrients in water), where similar contributing factors to climate change can affect oceans and negatively impact marine biodiversity. \u201cWithout concerted efforts, coastal eutrophication is expected to increase in 20 per cent of large marine ecosystems by 2050.\u201d\nThe Preparatory Meeting to the  convened in New York, US, in February 2017, to discuss the implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14. International law, as reflected in the  (UNCLOS), stressed the need to include governance instruments to consider \u201canthropogenic activities taking place outside of the ocean\u201d. Concerns regarding ocean health in destructive fishing practices and marine pollution were discussed, in looking at the role of local communities of  (SIDS) and  (LDCs) to not forget that oceans are a large part of their economies. The targets include preventing and reducing marine pollution and acidification, protecting marine and , and . The targets also call for an increase in scientific knowledge of the oceans.\nAlthough many participating United Nations legislative bodies comes together to discuss the issues around marine environments and SDG 14, such as at the United Nations Ocean Conference, it is important to consider how SDG 14 is implemented across different Multilateral Environmental Agreements, respectively. As climate, biodiversity and land degradation are major parts of the issues surrounding the deterioration of marine environments and oceans, it is important to know how each Rio Convention implements this SDG.\n cover 71 percent of the Earth's surface. They are essential for making the planet livable. ,  and climate are all regulated by  and . Over 3 billion people depend on marine life for their livelihood. Oceans absorb 30 percent of all  produced by humans. The oceans contain more than 200,000 identified species, and there might be thousands of species that are yet to be discovered. Oceans are the world's largest sources of protein. However, there has been a 26 percent increase in  since the . A full 30 percent of  have been destroyed, and 30 percent of the world's  are .  has reached shocking levels; each minute, 15 tons of plastic are released into the oceans. 20 percent of all  have been destroyed irreversibly, and another 24 percent are in immediate risk of collapse. Approximately 1 million sea birds, 100 000 marine mammals, and an unknown number of fish are harmed or die annually due to marine pollution caused by humans. It has been found that 95 percent of  in Norway have plastic parts in their guts.  are another form of marine pollution.\nIndividuals can help the oceans by reducing their  and their use of plastics. Nations can also take action. In Norway, for instance, citizens, working through a web page called finn.no, can earn money for picking up plastic on the beach. Several countries, including Kenya and Tanzania, have  for retail purchases. Improving the oceans contributes to , as it gives low-income families a source of income and healthy food. Keeping beaches and ocean water clean in less developed countries can attract tourism, as stated in Goal 8, and reduce poverty by providing more employment.\nCharacterized by , invasions, hybridizations and reductions in the abundance of species, marine biodiversity is currently in global decline. \u201cOver the past decades, there has been an exponential increase in human activates in and near oceans, resulting in negative consequences to our marine environment.\u201d Made evident by the degradation of  and changes in  processes, the declining health of the oceans has a negative effect on people, their livelihoods and entire economies, with local communities which rely on ocean resources being the most affected. Poor decisions in  can compromise , local livelihood, and resource sustainability goals. \u201cThe sustainable management of our oceans relies on the ability to influence and guide human use of the marine environment.\u201d As conservation of marine resources is critical to the well-being of local fishing communities and their livelihoods, related management actions may lead to changes in human behavior to support conservation programs to achieve their goals. Ultimately, governments and international agencies act as gatekeepers, interfering with needed stakeholder participation in decision making. The way to best safeguard life in oceans is to implement effective management strategies around marine environments.\n is used as a way of protecting the world's oceans. Oceans cover three quarters of the Earth's surface and impact global climate systems through functions of carbon dioxide absorption from the atmosphere and oxygen generation. The increase in levels of  leading to changes in climate negatively affects the world's oceans and marine coastal communities. The resulting impacts of rising sea levels by 20 centimeters since the start of the 20th century and the increase of ocean acidity by 30% since the  has contributed to the melting of  through the thermal expansion of sea water.\nSustainable Development Goal 14 has been incorporated into the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD).\nThis goal articulates targets for preserving biodiversity of forest, desert, and mountain eco-systems, as a percentage of total land mass. A \"land degradation-neutral world\" can be reached by restoring degraded forests and land lost to drought and flood. Goal 15 calls for more attention to preventing invasion of  and more protection of . Forests have a prominent role to play in the success of Agenda 2030, notably in terms of ecosystem services, livelihoods, and the green economy; but this will require clear priorities to address key tradeoffs and mobilize synergies with other SDGs.\nThe Mountain Green Cover Index monitors progress toward target 15.4, which focuses on preserving mountain ecosystems. The index is named as the indicator for target 15.4. Similarly, the Red Index (Red List Index or RLI) will fill the monitoring function for biodiversity goals by documenting the trajectory of endangered species. Animal extinction is a growing problem.\nReducing , , , and  are clear global goals. The International Community values  and  and calls for stronger judicial systems that will enforce laws and work toward a more peaceful and just society. By 2017, the UN could report progress on detecting victims of trafficking. More women and girls than men and boys were victimized, yet the share of women and girls has slowly declined (see also ). In 2004, 84 percent of victims were females and by 2014 that number had dropped to 71 percent. Sexual exploitation numbers have declined, but forced labor has increased.\nOne target is to see the end to sex trafficking, forced labor, and all forms of violence against and torture of children. However, reliance on the indicator of \"crimes reported\" makes monitoring and achieving this goal challenging. For instance, 84 percent of countries have no or insufficient data on violent punishment of children. Of the data available, it is clear that violence against children by their caregivers remains pervasive: Nearly 8 in 10 children aged 1 to 14 are subjected to violent discipline on a regular basis (regardless of income), and no country is on track to eliminate violent discipline by 2030.\nSDG 16 also targets universal legal identity and , ensuring the right to a name and nationality, , recognition before the law, and access to justice and social services. With more than a quarter of children under 5 unregistered worldwide as of 2015, about 1 in 5 countries will need to accelerate progress to achieve universal birth registration by 2030.\nIncreasing  is seen as vital to achieving each of the 16 previous goals. Goal 17 is included to assure that countries and organizations cooperate instead of compete. Developing multi-stakeholder partnerships to share knowledge, expertise, technology, and financial support is seen as critical to overall success of the SDGs. The goal encompasses improving north\u2013south and  cooperation, and  which involve civil societies are specifically mentioned.\nIn 2019 five progress reports on the 17 SDGs appeared. Three came from the  (UNDESA), one from the  and one from the . According to a review of the five reports in a synopsis, the allocation of the Goals and themes by the , the allocation was the following:\nIn explanation of the findings, the Basel Institute of Commons and Economics said Biodiversity, Peace and Social Inclusion were \"left behind\" by quoting the official SDGs motto \"Leaving no one behind\".\nThree sectors need to come together in order to achieve sustainable development. These are the economic, socio-political, and environmental sectors in their broadest sense. This requires the promotion of  and transdisciplinary research across different sectors, which can be difficult, particularly when major governments fail to support it.\nAccording to the UN, the target is to reach the community farthest behind. Commitments should be transformed into effective actions requiring a correct perception of target populations. However, numerical and non-numerical data or information must address all vulnerable groups such as children, elderly folks, , , , , and .\nThere is widespread consensus that progress on all of the SDGs will be stalled if women's empowerment and gender equality are not prioritized holistically \u2013 by policy makers as well as private sector executives and board members.\nStatements from diverse sources, such as the  (OECD),  and the  have noted that investments in women and girls have positive impacts on economies. National and global development investments often exceed their initial scope.\nEducation for sustainable development (ESD) is explicitly recognized in the SDGs as part of Target 4.7 of the SDG on education. UNESCO promotes the  (GCED) as a complementary approach. At the same time, it is important to emphasize ESD's importance for all the other 16 SDGs. With its overall aim to develop cross-cutting sustainability competencies in learners, ESD is an essential contribution to all efforts to achieve the SDGs. This would enable individuals to contribute to sustainable development by promoting societal, economic and political change as well as by transforming their own behavior.\nMassive open online courses (MOOCs) are free open education offered through online platforms. The (initial) philosophy of MOOCs was to open up quality  to a wider audience. As such, MOOCs are an important tool to achieve Goal 4 (\"Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all\"). At the same time, MOOCs also contribute to Goal 5, in that they are gender neutral and can give women and girls improved access to education.\n is expected to play a crucial part in the progressive advancement of the SDG agenda: \nIn 2017, 2018 and early 2019, the  held a series of ESG-focused discussions with pension board members (trustees) and senior investment executives from across  nations in ,  (with the UK Association of Member-Nominated Trustees, AMNT),   and  \u2013 notably on the sidelines of the 73rd session of the . Many pension investment executives and board members confirmed they were in the process of adopting or developing SDG-informed investment processes, with more ambitious investment governance requirements \u2013 notably when it comes to Climate Action, Gender Equity and Social Fairness: \u201cthey straddle key Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including, of course, Gender Equality (SDG 5) and Reduced Inequality (SDG 10) [\u2026] Many pension trustees are now playing for keeps\u201d.\nThe notion of \"SDG Driven Investment\" gained further ground amongst institutional investors in the second semester of 2019, notably at the   Pensions Roundtable held in , 26 August 2019, and the  held in Washington, DC, on 19 August 2019.\nImplementation of the SDGs started worldwide in 2016. This process can also be called \"Localizing the SDGs\". All over the planet, individual people, universities, governments and institutions and organizations of all kinds work on several goals at the same time. In each country, governments must translate the goals into national legislation, develop a plan of action, establish budgets and at the same time be open to and actively search for partners. Poor countries need the support of rich countries and coordination at the international level is crucial.\nThe independent campaign \"Project Everyone\" has met some resistance. In addition, several sections of civil society and governments felt the SDGs ignored \"\" even though it was the most important aspect of the agreement.\nA 2018 study in the journal  found that while \"nearly all African countries demonstrated improvements for children under 5 years old for stunting, wasting, and underweight... much, if not all of the continent will fail to meet the Sustainable Development Goal target\u2014to end malnutrition by 2030\".\nThere have been two books produced one by each of the co-chairs of the negotiations to help people to understand the Sustainable Development Goals and where they came from: \"Negotiating the Sustainable Development Goals: A transformational agenda for an insecure world\" written by Ambassador ,  and Jimena Leiva as well as \"Transforming Multilateral Diplomacy: The Inside Story of the Sustainable Development Goals\" by , David O'Connor and Pamela Chasek.\nThe online publication  was launched in June 2018 and presents data across all available indicators. It relies on the  database and is also based at the . The publication has global coverage and tracks whether the world is making progress towards the SDGs. It aims to make the data on the 17 goals available and understandable to a wide audience.\nThe website \"allows people around the world to hold their governments accountable to achieving the agreed goals\". The SDG-Tracker highlights that the world is currently (early 2019) very far away from achieving the goals.\nThe Global  is the first publication to track countries' performance on all 17 Sustainable Development Goals. The annual publication, co-produced by Bertelsmann Stiftung and SDSN, includes a ranking and dashboards that show key challenges for each country in terms of implementing the SDGs. The publication features trend analysis to show how countries performing on key SDG metrics have changed over recent years in addition to an analysis of government efforts to implement the SDGs.\n193 governments including the United States ratified the SDGs. However, the UN reported minimal progress after three years within the 15-year timetable of this project. Funding remains trillions of dollars short. The United States stand last among the G20 nations to attain these Sustainable Development Goals and 36th worldwide.\nThe UK's approach to delivering the Global SDGs is outlined in , developed by the . In 2019, the Bond network analyzed the UK's global progress on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  The Bond report highlights crucial gaps where attention and investment are most needed. The report was compiled by 49 organizations and 14 networks and working groups.\nBaltic nations, via the , have created the .\nThe  has observed that the UK and   have been at the forefront of ESG-driven (Environmental, Social and Governance) asset allocation at home and abroad and  of \"SDG-centric\" investment practices.\nThe  established the  to attain sustainable development goals. In March 2018 Haryana became the first state in India to have its annual budget focused on the attainment of SDG with a 3-year action plan and a 7-year strategy plan to implement sustainable development goals when , Finance Minister of , unveiled a  (equivalent to 120\u00a0billion, US$1.7\u00a0billion or \u20ac1.6\u00a0billion in 2019) annual 2018-19 budget.\nAlso, NITI Aayog starts the exercise of measuring India and its States\u2019 progress towards the SDGs for 2030, culminating in the development of the first SDG India Index - Baseline Report 2018\nBangladesh publishes the Development Mirror to track progress towards the 17 goals.\nThe Sustainable development process in  has a more meaningful purpose than economic growth alone. The nation's holistic goal is the pursuit of  (GNH), a term coined in 1972 by the Fourth King of Bhutan, , which has the principal guiding philosophy for the long term journey as a nation. Therefore, the SDGs find a natural and spontaneous place within the framework of GNH sharing a common vision of prosperity, peace, and harmony where no one is left behind. Just as GNH is both an ideal to be pursued and a practical tool so too the SDGs inspire and guide sustainable action.\nGuided by the development paradigm of GNH, Bhutan is committed to achieving the goals of SDGs by 2030 since its implementation in September 2015. In line with Bhutan's commitment to the implementation of the SDGs and sustainable development, Bhutan has participated in the Voluntary National Review in the 2018 High-Level Political Forum. \nAs the country has progressed in its 12th  (2019-2023), the national goals have been aligned with the SDGs and every agency plays a vital role in its own ways to collectively achieving the committed goals of SDGs.\nUN agencies which are part of the  decided to support an independent campaign to communicate the new SDGs to a wider audience. This campaign, \"Project Everyone,\" had the support of corporate institutions and other international organizations.\nUsing the text drafted by diplomats at the UN level, a team of communication specialists developed icons for every goal. They also shortened the title \"The 17 Sustainable Development Goals\" to \"/17#GlobalGoals,\" then ran workshops and conferences to communicate the Global Goals to a global audience.\nAn early concern was that 17 goals would be too much for people to grasp and that therefore the SDGs would fail to get a wider recognition. That without wider recognition the necessary momentum to achieve them by 2030 would not be archived. Concerned with this, British film-maker  started the organization in 2015 called Project Everyone with the aim to bring the goals to everyone on the planet. Curtis approached Swedish designer  who rebranded them as The Global Goals and created the 17 iconic visuals with clear short names as well as a logotype for the whole initiative. The communication system is available for free. In 2018 Jakob Trollb\u00e4ck and his company The New Division  went on to extend the communication system to also include the 169 targets that describe how the goals can be achieved.\nThe annual \"Le Temps Presse\" festival in  utilizes cinema to sensitize the public, especially young people, to the Sustainable Development Goals. The origin of the festival was in 2010 when eight directors produced a film titled \"8,\" which included eight short films, each featuring one of the . After 2.5 million viewers saw \"8\" on YouTube, the festival was created. It now showcases young directors whose work promotes social, environmental and human commitment. The festival now focuses on the Sustainable Development Goals.\nThe  is an annual  organized by  and supported by the SDGs' Partnership Platform. Held for the first time in 2019, the festival is expected to take place every year in September in , , Norway.\nThe benefits of engaging the affected public in decision making that affects their livelihoods, communities, and environment have been widely recognized. The  is a United Nations convention passed in 2001, explicitly to encourage and promote effective public engagement in environmental decision making. Information transparency related to social media and the engagement of youth are two issues related to the Sustainable Development Goals that Convention has addressed.\nThe Rockefeller Foundation asserts that \"The key to financing and achieving the SDGs lies in mobilizing a greater share of the $200+ trillion in annual private capital investment flows toward development efforts, and philanthropy has a critical role to play in catalyzing this shift.\" Large-scale funders participating in a Rockefeller Foundation-hosted design thinking workshop (June 2017: Scaling Solutions) were realistic.  They concluded that \"while there is a moral imperative to achieve the SDGs, failure is inevitable if there aren't drastic changes to how we go about financing large scale change\".\n estimated that alleviating poverty and achieving the other sustainable development goals will require about US$2\u20133 trillion per year for the next 15 years which they called \"pure fantasy\". Estimates for providing clean water and sanitation for the whole population of all continents have been as high as US$200 billion. The World Bank says that estimates need to be made country by country, and reevaluated frequently over time.\nIn 2014,  estimated the annual costs to achieving the UN Goals at $2.5 trillion per year.\nIn 2017 the UN launched the Inter-agency Task Force on Financing for Development (UN IATF on FfD) that invited to a public dialogue. In a policy paper, delivered by the Basel Institute of Commons and Economics, that conducts the , a UN SDG Partnership Initiative, the following figures on both the costs and the major sources to finance the SDGs have been published by the UN IATF on FfD:\nSource: Sachs, J., Schmidt-Traub, G., Kroll, C., Lafortune, G., Fuller, G. (2019): Sustainable Development Report 2019. New York: Bertelsmann Stiftung and Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN).\nThe SDGs have been criticized for setting contradictory goals and for trying to do everything first, instead of focusing on the most urgent or fundamental priorities. The SDGs were an outcome from a UN conference that was not criticized by any major  (NGO). Instead, the SDGs received broad support from many NGOs.\nSome of the goals compete with each other. For example, seeking high levels of quantitative  can make it difficult to attain , inequality reduction, and sustainability objectives. Similarly, increasing employment and wages can work against reducing the .\nContinued global economic growth of 3 percent (Goal 8) may not be reconcilable with ecological sustainability goals, because the required rate of absolute global  is far higher than any country has achieved in the past. Anthropologists have suggested that, instead of targeting aggregate GDP growth, the goals could target  use per capita, with \"substantial reductions in high\u2010income nations.\"\nA commentary in  in 2015 argued that 169 targets for the SDGs is too many, describing them as \"sprawling, misconceived\" and \"a mess\". The goals are said to ignore local context. All other 16 goals might be contingent on achieving SDG 1, ending poverty, which should have been at the top of a very short list of goals. In addition, Bhargava (2019) has emphasized the inter-dependence between the numerous sub-goals and the role played by population growth in developing countries in hampering their operationalization.\nOn the other hand, nearly all stakeholders engaged in negotiations to develop the SDGs agreed that the high number of 17 goals was justified because the agenda they address is all-encompassing.\nEnvironmental constraints and  are underrepresented within the SDGs. For instance, the paper \"Making the Sustainable Development Goals Consistent with Sustainability\" points out that the way the current SDGs are structured leads to a negative correlation between environmental sustainability and SDGs. This means, as the environmental sustainability side of the SDGs is underrepresented, the resource security for all, particularly for lower-income populations, is put at risk. This is not a criticism of the SDGs , but a recognition that their environmental conditions are still weak.\nA commentary in  in 2015 said that the SDGs are \"a mess\" compared to the eight MDGs used previously.\nBhargava, A.

ECOSOC passed resolution 1346 supporting the idea. General Assembly Resolution 2398 in 1969 decided to convene a conference in 1972 and mandated a set of reports from the UN secretary-general suggesting that the conference focus on \"stimulating and providing guidelines for action by national government and international organizations\" facing environmental issues. Preparations for the conference were extensive, lasting 4 years, including 114 governments, and costing over $30,000,000.\nThe  and other  nations boycotted the conference due to the lack of inclusion of , which was not allowed to participate as it was not a full member of the UN.\nAt the conference itself, divisions between developed and developing countries began to emerge. The Chinese delegation proved hostile to the United States at the conference, issuing a 17-point memorandum condemning , as well as around the world. This stance emboldened other developing countries, which made up 70 of the 122 countries attending. Multiple countries including , , and  issued statements that were anti-colonial in nature, further worrying the United States delegation. So harsh was the criticism that , at that time secretary of the interior, remarked  \"I wish the Russians were here\", to divert the attention of the Chinese criticisms.\nIn 1972, environmental governance was not seen as an international priority, particularly for the Global South. Developing nations supported its creation of the UNEP, not because they supported environmental governance, but because of its headquarters' location in , , as the UNEP would be the first UN agency to be based in a developing country.\nThe meeting agreed upon a ; an Action Plan with 109 recommendations, and a Resolution.\nPrinciples of the Stockholm Declaration:\nOne of the seminal issues that emerged from the conference is the recognition for poverty alleviation for protecting the environment. The Indian Prime Minister  in her seminal speech in the conference brought forward the connection between ecological management and .\nThe Stockholm Conference motivated countries around the world to monitor environmental conditions as well as to create environmental ministries and agencies. Despite these institutional accomplishments, including the establishment of UNEP, the failure to implement most of its action programme has prompted the UN to have follow-up conferences.  The succeeding United Nations Conference on Environment and Development convened in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 (the Rio Earth Summit), the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg and the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) all take their starting point in the declaration of the Stockholm Conference.  \nSome argue that this conference, and more importantly the scientific conferences preceding it, had a real impact on the environmental policies of the  (that later became the ). For example, in 1973, the EU created the Environmental and Consumer Protection Directorate, and composed the first Environmental Action Program. Such increased interest and research collaboration arguably paved the way for further understanding of global warming, which has led to such agreements as the  and the , and has given a foundation of modern environmentalism.\n Works related to  at Wikisource\n"},

Increasing  pollutes clean water supplies and much of the world still does not have access to clean, safe . In the industrial world  has slowed absolute usage rates but increasingly water is being transported over vast distances from water-rich natural areas to population-dense urban areas and energy-hungry  is becoming more widely used. Greater emphasis is now being placed on the improved management of blue (harvestable) and green (soil water available for plant use) water, and this applies at all scales of water management.\nLoss of biodiversity stems largely from the habitat loss and fragmentation produced by the human appropriation of land for development, forestry and agriculture as  is progressively converted to man-made capital. Land-use change is fundamental to the operations of the  because alterations in the relative proportions of land dedicated to , , , ,  and  have a marked effect on the global water, carbon and nitrogen  and this can negatively impact both natural and human systems. At the local human scale major sustainability benefits accrue from the pursuit of  and .\nSince the , human use has reduced the world's forest cover by about 47%. Present-day forests occupy about a quarter of the world's ice-free land with about half of these occurring in the tropics In temperate and  regions forest area is gradually increasing (with the exception of Siberia), but  in the tropics is of major concern.\nForests moderate the local climate and the global water cycle through their light reflectance () and . They also conserve , protect , preserve soil and , provide fuel and , and purify the air. These free  are not given a market value under most current economic systems, and so forest conservation has little appeal when compared with the economic benefits of  and clearance which, through  and organic  returns carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The United Nations  (FAO) estimates that about 90% of the carbon stored in land vegetation is locked up in trees and that they sequester about 50% more carbon than is present in the atmosphere. Changes in land use currently contribute about 20% of total global carbon emissions (heavily logged Indonesia and Brazil are a major source of emissions).  can be mitigated by sequestering carbon in  schemes, plantations and timber products. Also wood biomass can be utilized as a renewable  fuel. The FAO has suggested that, over the period 2005\u20132050, effective use of tree planting could absorb about 10\u201320% of man-made emissions \u2013 so monitoring the condition of the world's forests must be part of a global strategy to mitigate emissions and protect ecosystem services. However, climate change may pre-empt this FAO scenario as a study by the  in 2009 concluded that the stress of a 2.5C (4.5F) temperature rise above pre-industrial levels could result in the release of vast amounts of carbon so the potential of forests to act as carbon \"sinks\" is \"at risk of being lost entirely\".\nFeeding more than six billion human bodies takes a heavy toll on the Earth's resources. This begins with the appropriation of about 38% of the Earth's land surface and about 20% of its net primary productivity. Added to this are the resource-hungry activities of industrial agribusiness \u2013 everything from the crop need for irrigation water, synthetic  and  to the resource costs of food packaging,  (now a major part of global trade) and retail.  is essential to life. But the list of environmental costs of  is a long one: topsoil depletion,  and conversion to desert from constant tillage of annual crops; overgrazing; ; ; ; high levels of  use; reliance on inorganic fertilisers and synthetic organic ; reductions in  by the mass use of ; water ;  of waterbodies by run-off and ; social problems including the decline of family farms and weakening of .\nAll of these environmental problems associated with  and  are now being addressed through such movements as ,  and more sustainable business practices.\nAlthough  can be monitored simply as loss of species, effective conservation demands the protection of species within their natural habitats and ecosystems. Following human migration and population growth, species  have progressively increased to a rate unprecedented since the . Known as the  this current human-induced extinction of species ranks as one of the world's six mass . Some scientific estimates indicate that up to half of presently existing species may become extinct by 2100. Current extinction rates are 100 to 1000 times their prehuman levels with more than 10% birds and mammals threatened, about 8% of plants, 5% of fish and more than 20% of freshwater species.\nThe 2008  warns that long-term droughts and extreme weather put additional stress on key habitats and, for example, lists 1,226 bird species as threatened with extinction, which is one-in-eight of all bird species. The  also identifies 44 tree species in Central Asia as under threat of extinction due to  and human development and threatening the region's forests which are home to more than 300 wild ancestors of modern domesticated fruit and nut cultivars.\nIn many parts of the industrial world land clearing for agriculture has diminished and here the greatest threat to biodiversity, after , has become the destructive effect of .  Increasingly efficient global transport has facilitated the spread of  across the planet. The potential danger of this aspect of  is starkly illustrated through the spread of human diseases like  , ,  and , but invasive plants and animals are also having a devastating impact on native . Non-indigenous organisms can quickly occupy disturbed land and natural areas where, in the absence of their natural , they are able to thrive. At the global scale this issue is being addressed through the  but there is improved international  legislation to minimise the transmission of pathogens and invasive organisms. Also, through  legislation there is control the trade in rare and threatened species. Increasingly at the local level public awareness programs are alerting communities, gardeners, the nursery industry, collectors, and the pet and aquarium industries, to the harmful effects of potentially invasive species.\nThe environmental sustainability problem has proven difficult to solve. The modern  has attempted to solve the problem in a large variety of ways. But little progress has been made, as shown by severe  overshoot and lack of sufficient progress on the  problem.

Sustainable infrastructure is the development of water, sewer, roads, and other infrastructure systems that meet the needs of current and future generations in a socially, economically and environmentally sustainable manner. Communities of Tomorrow brings industry firms together with researchers to collaboratively develop new infrastructure solutions to existing or future problems with the ultimate goal to commercialize them.  It's about building greener and longer lasting infrastructure, such as roads and water systems, to offer the global marketplace.\nThe Swiss  (GIB) supports various stakeholders, such as governments, banks and cities, in the designing, implementing and financing sustainable urban infrastructure projects at all stages of the project cycle. Currently, GIB has developed, in cooperation with the French bank , the SuRe\u00ae Standard \u2013 The Standard for Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure, which is a global voluntary ISEAL standard. GIB has also developed the SuRe\u00ae SmartScan, a simplified version of the SuRe\u00ae Standard that serves as a self-assessment tool for sustainable infrastructure projects.

It represents a change in how a society thinks about the use of natural resources and . By looking at a product's entire lifecycle new opportunities can be found to reduce environmental impacts, conserve resources, and reduce costs.\nU.S. and global consumption of materials increased rapidly during the last century. According to the Annex to the G7 Leaders\u2019 June 8, 2015 Declaration, global raw material use rose during the 20th century at about twice the rate of population growth. For every 1 percent increase in gross domestic product, raw material use has risen by 0.4 percent. This increasing consumption has come at a cost to the environment, including , , overly stressed fisheries and . Materials management is also associated with an estimated 42 percent of total U.S.  emissions. Failure to find more productive and sustainable ways to extract, use and manage materials, and change the relationship between material consumption and growth, has grave implications for our economy and society.\nSustainable Materials Management (SMM) represents a framework to sustainably manage materials and products throughout the entire lifecycle, from resource extraction, design and manufacturing, resource productivity, consumption and end-of-life management.\nTraditional patterns of material consumption in the United States follow a Cradle-to-Grave pattern of raw material extraction, product manufacturing, distribution to consumers, use by consumers, and disposal; coined by  author Annie Leonard as the \"take-make-waste\" linear economy and commonly referred to as the , these familiar waste management practices are being revised to bring about sustainable management of resources. SMM represents a shift in how materials are used and valued with a focus on the environmental impact of material use and environmental protection throughout the entire lifecycle of a product. SMM has been adopted as a regulatory approach to manage materials by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and many other governments around the world.\nSustainable Materials Management is a broad approach that overlaps and supplements many programs and concepts being adopted by governments and business around the world including , ,    , sustainable , , , the , the , UNEP's Sustainable Production and Consumption and Sustainable Resource Management programs, and OECD's Sustainable Materials Management framework.\nThere are several similar and overlapping efforts to define and conceptualize a closed loop lifecycle of product and materials management, with many of these efforts being spearheaded by government agencies, entrepreneurs, scientists and non-governmental organizations. While similar to SMM, these product lifecycle models focus largely on the end-of-life management of materials while SMM focuses on the impacts materials, products and services have on the environment such as , , ,  and  as well as  and .\n\nThe Product Stewardship Institute defines  as: \"the act of minimizing the health, safety, environmental, and social impacts of a product and its packaging throughout all lifecycle stages, while also maximizing economic benefits. The manufacturer, or producer, of the product has the greatest ability to minimize adverse impacts, but other stakeholders, such as suppliers, retailers, and consumers, also play a role. Stewardship can be either voluntary or required by law\".British Columbia (BC) has an extensive product stewardship network administered by BC Recycles and composed of BC producers and brand owners who are required by law to collect and divert end-of-life products and packaging.\nThe U.Ks  (WRAP) defines the  as being an alternative to the traditional take, make, waste economy to one that keeps resources in use as long as possible, extracts the maximum value from the materials while they are in use, then recovers the materials to generate new products at the end of the service life.\nThe  works to accelerate the transition to a circular economy by working with businesses, academia and governments throughout the world to develop an economy that is restorative and regenerative by design and seeks to keep products, components and materials at their highest use and value at all times, distinguishing between biological and technical cycles.\n\nThe Dictionary of Sustainable Management defines  as \"A phrase invented by Walter R. Stahel in the 1970s and popularized by William McDonough and Michael Braungart in their 2002 book of the same name. This framework seeks to create production techniques that are not just efficient but are essentially waste free. In cradle-to-cradle production, all material inputs and outputs are seen either as technical or biological nutrients. Technical nutrients can be recycled or reused with no loss of quality and biological nutrients composted or consumed. By contrast cradle-to-grave refers to a company taking responsibility for the disposal of goods it has produced, but not necessarily putting products\u2019 constituent components back into service.\" In closed loop recycling, a material is captured at the end of life and introduced back into the manufacturing process to make a new product \nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) formed in 1960 and currently comprising 35 member countries including the United States, Canada, Mexico, Japan and 23 countries in the European Union, works to foster economic prosperity and end poverty by promoting economic growth and financial stability for governments around the world while also taking into account the implications that economic and social growth have on the environment.\nSince the 1980s, the OECD has worked to promote policies that prevent, reduce and manage waste in ways that mitigate environmental impacts. It has become clear over time that increasing economic activity and materials consumptions calls for a systematic materials based approach to managing waste, one that seeks to incorporate materials back into the manufacturing process at the end of their life, in what is commonly referred to as a \u201ccradle to cradle\u201d approach to materials management as opposed to the traditional \u201ccradle to grave\u201d waste management approach. Around 2001 the OECD began to address many countries\u2019 interest in viewing waste as a resource that can be used as inputs for new products and many countries and governments have begun adopting sustainable materials management policies.\n\nIn 2012, the OECD put out a Green Growth Policy Brief on Sustainable Materials Management. In it they define SMM as\u201c\u2026an approach to promote sustainable materials use, integrating actions targeted at reducing negative environmental impacts and preserving  throughout the life-cycle of materials, taking into account economic efficiency and social equity\u201d.The OECD working definition includes the following notes on the definition of SMM:\nSustainable Production and Consumption (UNEP)\nSustainable Resource Management (UNEP)\n\nThe US EPA has adopted Sustainable Materials Management as a regulatory framework for managing materials. In June 2009 the EPA put out a report that functioned as a road map to SMM in the U.S. titled . In this report, EPA defines SMM as \u201c... an approach to serving human needs by using/reusing resources productively and sustainably throughout their life cycles, generally minimizing the amount of materials involved and all associated environmental impacts\u201d.The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) sets the legislative basis for SSM in the United States, establishing a preference for resource conservation over disposal.  In 2010, the Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery shifted focus from just  efforts to adopt a broader sustainable materials management approach. The new approach includes the two original waste management mandates of RCRA: 1) to protect human health and the environment from waste and 2) to conserve resources, and adds in three additional goals: 1) to \u201cReduce waste and increase the efficient and sustainable use of resources\u201d, 2) \u201cPrevent exposures to humans and ecosystems from the use of hazardous chemicals\u201d 3) \u201cManage wastes and clean up chemical releases in a safe, environmentally sound manner\u201d.\nIn 2015 EPA published the report .

The decision to hold the conference was made by UN General Assembly Resolution A/RES/64/236 on 24 December 2009. It was intended to be a high-level conference, including heads of state and government or other representatives and resulting in a focused political document designed to shape global environmental policy.\nDuring the final three days of the Conference, from 20 to 22 June 2012, world leaders and representatives met for intense meetings which culminated in finalizing the non-binding document, \"The World We Want\" which opens with \"We the Heads of State and Government and high-level representatives\", having met at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 20 to 22 June 2012, with the full participation of civil society, renew our commitment to sustainable development and to ensuring the promotion of an economically, socially and environmentally sustainable future for our planet and for present and future generations.\"\nIn 1992, the first conference of its kind, the  (), commonly referred to as the Rio Conference or Earth Summit, succeeded in raising public awareness of the need to integrate environment and development. The conference drew 109 heads of state to , , to address what were dubbed urgent problems of environmental protection and socio-economic development. The Earth Summit influenced subsequent UN conferences, including Rio+20 and set the global green agenda. \"The World Conference on Human Rights, for example, focused on the right of people to a healthy environment and the right to development; controversial demands that had met with resistance from some Member States until the Earth Summit.\"\nMajor outcomes of the conference include the  (UNFCCC) \u2014a climate-change agreement that led to the , , the  (CBD) and the  (UNCCD).

This stage ended with the January 2012 publication of the draft document, \"The Future We Want\" The 1st Preparatory Committee was held from 16\u201318 May 2010, immediately after the conclusion of the eighteenth session and the first meeting of the nineteenth session of the . The 1st Intersessional\u2014which was not a negotiation session \u2013 featured panel discussions, from academia, non-governmental organizations as well as Delegates and UN system representatives\u2014was held from 10\u201311 January 2011 at UN Headquarters, . The 2nd Preparatory Committee was held from 7\u20138 March 2011, at  in New York, immediately following the Intergovernmental Policy Meeting for the 19th Session of the .

Th three-day intense meetings with hundreds of \"heads of states from around the world\" met in Rio de Janeiro after the 3rd Preparatory Meeting had concluded.\nAccording to a 13 June 2012  article, the \"giant, 10-day-long\" Conference underway in Rio de Janeiro which would end on June 22, 2012, was \"expected to draw 50,000 participants, including delegates, environmental activists, business leaders, and indigenous groups.\" For the final three days of the conference, \"about 130 heads of state from around the world were expected to be present.\"\nBilled as the biggest UN event ever organized\u2014with 15,000 soldiers and police guarding about 130 heads of state and government, from 192 countries, and the more than 45,000 individuals gathered in \u2014the 10-day mega-conference was intended to be a high-level international gathering organized to re-direct and renew global political commitment to the three dimensions of sustainable development: economic growth, social improvement and environmental protection; focusing on reducing poverty while promoting  jobs growth, clean energy and more fair, sustainable uses of resources; goals first established at Earth Summit in 1992. \n\nThe conference centered around Agenda 21, the outcome document from Earth Summit 1992. That document was considered revolutionary in that it essentially created the term sustainable development and created the global environmental agenda for the next 20 years. The representatives of participating governments gathered in Rio to discuss what was then the draft text of the outcome document.\nRio+20 sought to secure affirmations for the political commitments made at past Earth Summits and set the global environmental agenda for the next 20 years by assessing progress towards the goals set forth in Agenda 21 and implementation gaps therein, and discussing new and emerging issues.\n The UN wanted Rio to endorse a UN \"green economy roadmap\", with environmental goals, targets and deadlines, whereas developing countries preferred establishing new \"sustainable development goals\" to better protect the environment, guarantee food and power to the poorest, and alleviate poverty.\nRio+20 attracted many protests, and more than 500 parallel events, exhibitions, presentations, fairs and announcements as a wide range of diverse groups struggled to take advantage of the conference in order to gain international attention. The British online newspaper, The Guardian reported that, \"Downtown Rio de Janeiro was partly shut-down as an estimated 50,000 protesters, some of whom were naked, took to the streets.\"\nFrom 20 to 22 June 2012, world leaders and representatives met for intense meetings which culminated in finalizing the non-binding document, \"The Future We Want: Outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 20\u201322 June 2012\", which opens with, \"We the Heads of State and Government and high-level representatives\", having met at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 20 to 22 June 2012, with the full participation of civil society, renew our commitment to sustainable development and to ensuring the promotion of an economically, socially and environmentally sustainable future for our planet and for present and future generations.\"\n\nThe first draft of the document was released in January 2012 as a result of preliminary intergovernmental discussions and negotiations that had taken place since May 2010.\nA streamlined version of \"The Future We Want\", was released on April 2012 following the second phase of negotiations.\nAt the Rio+20 Conference in June 2012, the heads of state of the 192 governments in attendance, renewed their political commitment to sustainable development and declared their commitment to the promotion of a sustainable future through the 49-page nonbinding document,  \"The Future We Want: Outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 20\u201322 June 2012.\" The dates June 20 to 22 reflect the three-day meeting of world leaders, the culmination of Rio+20.\nThe document largely reaffirms previous action plans like Agenda 21.  \nThe document, \"The Future We Want,\" called for the development of  (SDGs), a set of measurable targets aimed at promoting sustainable development globally. It is thought that the SDGs [would] pick up where the Millennium Development Goals leave off and address criticism that the original Goals fail to address the role of the environment in development.\"\nThere were eight key recommendations regarding the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) , which included strengthening its governance to potentially become, a \"leading global environmental authority\", through universal membership, increasing its financial resources and strengthening its engagement in key UN coordination bodies.\nAccording to a 23 June 2012  article, nations agreed to explore alternatives to GDP as a measure of wealth that take environmental and social factors into account in an effort to assess and pay for 'environmental services' provided by nature, such as carbon sequestration and habitat protection.\nRecognition that \"fundamental changes in the way societies consume and produce are indispensable for achieving global sustainable development.\" EU officials suggest it could lead to a shift of taxes so workers pay less and polluters and landfill operators pay more.\nThe document calls the need to return ocean stocks to sustainable levels \"urgent\" and calls on countries to develop and implement science-based management plans.\nAll nations reaffirmed commitments to phase out fossil fuel subsidies.\nIn addition to the outcome text, there were over 400 voluntary commitments for sustainable development made by Member States.\nAt the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment, 40 African countries agreed to implement \"The Future We Want.\"\nA few key global leaders\u2014mostly G20 leaders and namely  ,  , and  \u2014did not attend the conference and blamed their absence on the ongoing . Their collective absence was seen as a reflection of their administrations' failure to prioritize sustainability issues. \"In not attending, the prime minister is sending out a powerful signal that the UK government does not see sustainability as a priority\", Joan Walley, chair of the UK environmental audit committee said to The Guardian.\namong others\nActivists took initiative at Rio+20 by staging numerous protests.

Firstly, they poked at  , claiming she has given in to the global North's corporate hand.  Rousseff's controversy has arisen over her steadfast desire to further industrialize Brazil, and its economy. Additionally, the crowds assembled for a ritual and symbolic \"tearing up\" of the plenary's negotiated text, conveying their disapproval.\nThousands of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) gathered at the Flamengo Park in Rio. They criticized the draft negotiating text, particularly for its failure to mention planetary boundaries or nuclear energy, in light of the  in . Organizations, such as  and the , as well as members of indigenous communities, activists and artists participated. The Danish artist , the leader of the group , and the Group 92 used his Freedom to Pollute sculptures to focus on global warming and its resulting increased flow of refugees. About 20,000 flyers about Freedom to Pollute were distributed during  and a related television program was produced in .\nThere were some demonstrations protesting the participation of the President of Iran  along with the Iranian delegation. The controversy of Iranian attendance at the summit surrounds the fact that Iran has serious environmental issues, which it has refused to address, continuing human rights violations and is refusing to cooperate with the  over its contentious nuclear program. Ahmadinejad was met with demonstrations, attended by thousands of people, on his 20 June arrival in Rio, \nwith some protesters waving banners with the slogan \"Ahmadinejad go home\".\nDuring RIO +20 event and preparatory events  included Civil Societies invited to organize side events, promote the RIO event, submit literature and help the Rio secretariat with translation work. The logo and promotion of RIO +20 was available in languages used in . Civil societies also translated the logo image and literature in other local and National languages.\nEcology and Environment Inc., a New York-based Environmental Engineering and Consultation company partnered with UNCSD to create Project Earth Network, an online platform where schools around the world could showcase their remarkable environmental projects. In coordination with the Rio+20 event, the platform hosted a World Environment Day Global School Contest in which 7th graders at the International School of Ulaanbaatar (ISU) in Mongolia were declared the Global Winners for their awareness campaign on the environmental impact of plastic shopping bags, including research on plastic bag manufacturing processes, development of videos documenting plastic bag waste, and a school presentation at which reusable cloth shopping bags were sold to approximately 50 percent of the community.\nSarasota, Fla.'s Brookside Middle School won in the World Environment Day contest's North American sub-category for its mangrove propagule growth project while International School of Brussels in Belgium won the European sub-category, for their creation of a sustainable food source and composting program. The Middle-Eastern sub-category winner was , a seventh grader from  in Oman for his organization, '' which helped promote sustainable awareness across the region through interactive projects. Hridith Sudev later went on to become an inventor and the organization has become a global environmental presence. The World Environment Day contest followed an Earth Day \"Green Schools\" contest regionally focused toward 6th to 12th grade students in the Western New York area.\nThe idea behind the platform was to encourage sustainability in students across the world. Despite the huge response, the platform was taken down two years later due to technical and economic constraints but has since remained as a positive legacy through the activities of students who were first recognized by the network.\n\n"},

Sustainable forest management has to keep the balance between three main pillars: ,  and . Successfully achieving sustainable forest management will provide integrated benefits to all, ranging from safeguarding local livelihoods to protecting the biodiversity and ecosystems provided by forests, reducing rural poverty and mitigating some of the effects of climate change.\nThe \"\" adopted at the  (United Nations Conference on Environment and Development) in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 captured the general international understanding of  forest management at that time.  A number of sets of  have since been developed to evaluate the achievement of SFM at the global, regional, country and management unit level. These were all attempts to codify and provide for independent assessment of the degree to which the broader objectives of sustainable forest management are being achieved in practice. In 2007, the  adopted the .  The instrument was the first of its kind, and reflected the strong international commitment to promote implementation of sustainable forest management through a new approach that brings all stakeholders together.\nA definition of SFM was developed by the  (FOREST EUROPE), and has since been adopted by the  (FAO). It defines sustainable forest management as:\nThe stewardship and use of  and forest lands in a way, and at a rate, that maintains their biodiversity, productivity, regeneration capacity, vitality and their potential to fulfill, now and in the future, relevant ecological, economic and social functions, at local, national, and global levels, and that does not cause damage to other ecosystems.In simpler terms, the concept can be described as the attainment of balance \u2013 balance between society's increasing demands for forest products and benefits, and the preservation of forest health and diversity. This balance is critical to the survival of forests, and to the prosperity of forest-dependent communities.\nFor forest managers, sustainably managing a particular forest tract means determining, in a tangible way, how to use it today to ensure similar benefits, health and productivity in the future. Forest managers must assess and integrate a wide array of sometimes conflicting factors \u2013 commercial and non-commercial values, environmental considerations, community needs, even global impact \u2013 to produce sound forest plans. In most cases, forest managers develop their forest plans in consultation with citizens, businesses, organizations and other interested parties in and around the forest tract being managed. The tools and visualization have been recently evolving for better management practices.\nThe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, at the request of Member States, developed and launched the  in 2014, an online collection of tools best practices and examples of their application to support countries implementing sustainable forest management.\nBecause forests and societies are in constant flux, the desired outcome of sustainable forest management is not a fixed one. What constitutes a sustainably managed forest will change over time as values held by the public change.\nCriteria and indicators are tools which can be used to conceptualise, evaluate and implement sustainable forest management. Criteria define and characterize the essential elements, as well as a set of conditions or processes, by which sustainable forest management may be assessed. Periodically measured indicators reveal the direction of change with respect to each criterion.\nCriteria and indicators of sustainable forest management are widely used and many countries produce national reports that assess their progress toward sustainable forest management.  There are nine international and regional criteria and indicators initiatives, which collectively involve more than 150 countries. Three of the more advanced initiatives are those of the Working Group on Criteria and Indicators for the Conservation and Sustainable Management of Temperate and Boreal Forests (also called the ), , and the . Countries who are members of the same initiative usually agree to produce reports at the same time and using the same indicators. Within countries, at the management unit level, efforts have also been directed at developing local level criteria and indicators of sustainable forest management. The , the  and researchers at the  have developed a number of tools and techniques to help forest-dependent communities develop their own local level criteria and indicators. Criteria and Indicators also form the basis of third-party forest certification programs such as the 's  and the  Standard.\nThere appears to be growing international consensus on the key elements of sustainable forest management.  Seven common thematic areas of sustainable forest management have emerged based on the criteria of the nine ongoing regional and international criteria and indicators initiatives.  The seven thematic areas are:\nThis consensus on common thematic areas (or criteria) effectively provides a common, implicit definition of sustainable forest management.  The seven thematic areas were acknowledged by the international forest community at the fourth session of the  and the 16th session of the Committee on Forestry. These thematic areas have since been enshrined in the  as a reference framework for sustainable forest management to help achieve the purpose of the instrument.\nOn January 5, 2012, the Montr\u00e9al Process, Forest Europe, the International Tropical Timber Organization, and the , acknowledging the seven thematic areas, endorsed a  to improve global forest-related data collection and reporting and avoiding the proliferation of monitoring requirements and associated reporting burdens.\nThe  has been prominent on the agenda of the  (CBD) since 1995 . The  definition of the Ecosystem Approach and a set of principles for its application were developed at an expert meeting in  in 1995, known as the Malawi Principles. The definition, 12 principles and 5 points of \"operational guidance\" were adopted by the fifth Conference of Parties (COP5) in 2000.  The  definition is as follows\nThe ecosystem approach is a strategy for the integrated management of land, water and living resources that promotes conservation and sustainable use in an equitable way. Application of the ecosystem approach will help to reach a balance of the three objectives of the Convention. An ecosystem approach is based on the application of appropriate scientific methodologies focused on levels of biological organization, which encompasses the essential structures, processes, functions and interactions among organisms and their environment. It recognizes that humans, with their , are an integral component of many ecosystems.Sustainable forest management was recognized by parties to the  in 2004 (Decision VII/11 of COP7) to be a concrete means of applying the Ecosystem Approach to forest ecosystems.  The two concepts, sustainable forest management and the ecosystem approach, aim at promoting conservation and management practices which are environmentally, socially and economically sustainable, and which generate and maintain benefits for both present and future generations. In Europe, the MCPFE and the Council for the Pan-European Biological and Landscape Diversity Strategy (PEBLDS) jointly recognized sustainable forest management to be consistent with the Ecosystem Approach in 2006.\nGrowing  and  for more socially responsible businesses helped third-party forest  emerge in the 1990s as a credible tool for communicating the environmental and social performance of forest operations.\nThere are many potential users of certification, including: forest managers, scientists, policy makers, investors, environmental advocates, business consumers of wood and paper, and individuals.\nWith third-party , an independent organization develops standards of good forest management, and independent auditors issue certificates to forest operations that comply with those standards. Forest certification verifies that forests are well-managed \u2013 as defined by a particular standard \u2013 and chain-of-custody certification tracks wood and paper products from the certified forest through processing to the point of sale.\nThis rise of certification led to the emergence of several different systems throughout the world. As a result, there is no single accepted forest management standard worldwide, and each system takes a somewhat different approach in defining standards for sustainable forest management.\nIn its 2009\u20132010 Forest Products Annual Market Review United Nations Economic Commission for Europe/Food and Agriculture Organization stated: \"Over the years, many of the issues that previously divided the (certification) systems have become much less distinct. The largest certification systems now generally have the same structural programmatic requirements.\"\nThird-party forest certification is an important tool for those seeking to ensure that the paper and wood products they purchase and use come from forests that are well-managed and legally harvested. Incorporating third-party certification into forest product procurement practices can be a centerpiece for comprehensive wood and paper policies that include factors such as the protection of sensitive forest values, thoughtful material selection and efficient use of products.\nThere are more than fifty certification standards worldwide, addressing the diversity of forest types and tenures. Globally, the two largest umbrella certification programs are:\nThe area of forest certified worldwide is growing slowly.  PEFC is the world's largest forest certification system, with more than two-thirds of the total global certified area certified to its Sustainability Benchmarks.\nIn North America, there are three certification standards endorsed by PEFC \u2013 the Sustainable Forestry Initiative, the Canadian Standards Association's Sustainable Forest Management Standard, and the American Tree Farm System. FSC has five standards in North America \u2013 one in the United States and four in Canada.\nWhile certification is intended as a tool to enhance forest management practices throughout the world, to date most certified forestry operations are located in Europe and North America. A significant barrier for many forest managers in  is that they lack the capacity to undergo a certification audit and maintain operations to a certification standard.\nAlthough a majority of forests continue to be owned formally by government, the effectiveness of forest governance is increasingly independent of formal ownership. Since neo-liberal ideology in the 1980s and the emanation of the climate change challenges, evidence that the state is failing to effectively manage environmental resources has emerged. Under  regimes in the developing countries, the role of the state has diminished and the  have increasingly taken over the dominant socio-economic role.\nThough the critiques of neo-liberal policies have maintained that market forces are not only inappropriate for sustaining the environment, but are in fact a major cause of . Hardin's tragedy of the commons (1968) has shown that the people cannot be left to do as they wish with land or . Thus,  of management offers an alternative solution to forest governance.\nThe shifting of natural resource management responsibilities from central to state and local governments, where this is occurring, is usually a part of broader decentralization process. According to Rondinelli and Cheema (1983), there are four distinct decentralization options: these are: (i) Privatization \u2013 the transfer of authority from the central government to non-governmental sectors otherwise known as market-based service provision, (ii) Delegation \u2013 centrally nominated local authority, (iii)  \u2013 transfer of power to locally acceptable authority and (iv) Deconcentration \u2013 the redistribution of authority from the central government to field delegations of the central government.\nThe major key to effective decentralization is increased broad-based participation in local-public decision making. In 2000, the World Bank report reveals that local government knows the needs and desires of their constituents better than the national government, while at the same time, it is easier to hold local leaders accountable. From the study of West African tropical forest, it is argued that the downwardly accountable and/or representative authorities with meaningful discretional powers are the basic institutional element of decentralization that should lead to efficiency, development and equity. This collaborates with the World Bank report in 2000 which says that decentralization should improve resource allocation, efficiency, accountability and equity \"by linking the cost and benefit of local services more closely\".\nMany reasons point to the advocacy of decentralization of forest. (i) Integrated rural development projects often fail because they are top-down projects that did not take local people's needs and desires into account. (ii) National government sometimes have legal authority over vast forest areas that they cannot control, thus, many protected area projects result in increased  and greater social conflict.\nWithin the sphere of forest management, as state earlier, the most effective option of decentralization is \"devolution\"-the transfer of power to locally accountable authority. However, apprehension about local governments is not unfounded. They are often short of resources, may be staffed by people with low education and are sometimes captured by local elites who promote clientelist relation rather than democratic participation. Enters and Anderson (1999) point that the result of community-based projects intended to reverse the problems of past central approaches to conservation and development have also been discouraging.\nBroadly speaking, the goal of forest conservation has historically not been met when, in contrast with  changes; driven by demand for food, fuel and profit. It is necessary to recognize and advocate for better forest governance more strongly given the importance of forest in meeting basic  in the future and maintaining ecosystem and biodiversity as well as addressing climate change mitigation and adaptation goal. Such advocacy must be coupled with financial incentives for government of  and greater governance role for local government, civil society, private sector and NGOs on behalf of the \"communities\".\nThe development of National Forest Funds is one way to address the issue of financing sustainable forest management.  National forest funds (NFFs) are dedicated financing mechanisms managed by public institutions designed to support the conservation and sustainable use of forest resources. As of 2014, there are 70 NFFs operating globally.\nAppropriate use and long-term conservation of  (FGR) is a part of sustainable forest management. In particular when it comes to the adaptation of  and  to .  ensures that forest trees can survive, adapt and evolve under changing environmental conditions. Genetic diversity in forests also contributes to tree vitality and to the  towards pests and diseases. Furthermore, FGR has a crucial role in maintaining forest biological diversity at both species and  levels.\nSelecting carefully the  with emphasis on getting a high genetic diversity rather than aiming at producing a uniform stand of trees, is essential for sustainable use of FGR. Considering the  is crucial as well. For example in relation to climate change, local material may not have the genetic diversity or  to guarantee good performance under changed conditions. A different  from further away, which may have experienced  under conditions more like those forecast for the site to be , might represent a more suitable seed source.\nIn December of 2007, at the Climate Change Conference in , the issue of deforestation in the developing world in particular was raised and discussed. The foundations of a new incentive mechanism for encouraging sustainable forest management measures was therefore laid in hopes of reducing world deforestation rates. This mechanism was formalized and adopted as REDD in November of 2010 at the Climate Change Conference in Cancun by UNFCCC COP 16.  Developing country who are signatories of the  were encouraged to take measure to implement REDD activities in the hope of becoming more active contributors of global efforts aimed at the mitigation greenhouse gas. After all, deforestation and forest degradation account for roughly 15% of total global greenhouse gas emissions. The REDD activities are formally tasked with \u201creducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation; and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries\u201d.  REDD+ works in 3 phases. The first phase consists of developing viable strategies, while the second phase begins work on technology development and technology transfer to the developing countries taking part in REDD+ activities. The last phase measures and reports the implementation of the action taken  \nThe province of  has its own sustainable forest management measures in place. A little less than half of all the publicly owned forest of  are managed forest whose management activities are required by The Crown Forest Sustainability Act to be managed sustainably. Sustainable management is often done by forest companies who are granted Sustainable Forest Licenses which are valid for 20 years. The main goals of the Ontario\u2019s sustainable forest management efforts is to ensure that the forest are kept healthy and productive, conserving biodiversity, all whilst supporting communities and forest industry jobs. All management strategies and plans are highly regulated, arranged to last for a 10-year period, and follow the strict guidelines of the Forest Management Planning Manual.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_urban_drainage_systems", "title": "SustainabledrainagesystemWikipedia", "body": " (also known as , , or ) are a collection of water management practices that aim to align modern drainage systems with natural water processes. SuDS efforts make urban drainage systems more compatible with components of the natural water cycle such as  overflows, soil percolation, and bio-filtration. These efforts hope to mitigate the effect human development has had or may have on the , particularly surface runoff and water pollution trends. SuDS have become popular in recent decades as our understanding of how urban development affects natural environments, as well as concern for climate change and sustainability, have increased. SuDS often use built components that mimic natural features in order to integrate urban drainage systems into the natural drainage systems or a site as efficiently and quickly as possible.\nDrainage systems have been found in ancient cities over 5,000 years old, including Minoan, Indus, Persian, and Mesopotamian civilizations. These drainage systems focused mostly on reducing nuisances from localized flooding and waste water. Rudimentary systems made from brick or stone channels constituted the extent of urban drainage technologies for centuries. Cities in  also employed drainage systems to protect low-lying areas from excess rainfall. When builders began constructing  to import fresh water into cities, urban drainage systems became integrated into water supply infrastructure for the first time as a unified urban water cycle. \nModern drainage systems did not appear until the 19th century in Western Europe, although most of these systems were primarily built to deal with sewage issues rising from rapid . One such example is that of the , which was constructed to combat massive contamination of the . At the time, the River Thames was the primary component of London's drainage system, with human waste concentrating in the waters adjacent to the densely populated urban center. As a result, several epidemics plagued London's residents and even members of , including events known as the  and the . The concern for public health and quality of life launched several initiatives, which ultimately led to the creation of London's modern sewerage system designed by . This new system explicitly aimed to ensure waste water was redirected as far away from water supply sources as possible in order to reduce the threat of waterborne . Since then, most urban drainage systems have aimed for similar goals of preventing public health crises. \nWithin past decades, as climate change and urban flooding have become increasingly urgent challenges, drainage systems designed specifically for environmental sustainability have become more popular in both academia and practice. The first sustainable drainage system to utilize a full management train including source control in the UK was the  motorway station designed by SuDS specialists Robert Bray Associates Originally the term SUDS described the UK approach to sustainable urban drainage systems. These developments may not necessarily be in \"urban\" areas, and thus the \"urban\" part of SuDS is now usually dropped to reduce confusion. Other countries have similar approaches in place using a different terminology such as  (BMP) and  in the United States, and  in Australia.\nTraditional urban drainage systems are limited by various factors including volume capacity, damage or blockage from debris and contamination of drinking water. Many of these issues are addressed by SuDS systems by bypassing traditional drainage systems altogether and returning rainwater to natural water sources or streams as soon as possible. Increasing  has caused problems with increased  after sudden rain. As areas of vegetation are replaced by concrete, , or roofed structures, leading to , the area loses its ability to absorb rainwater. This rain is instead directed into surface water drainage systems, often overloading them and causing floods.\nThe goal of all sustainable drainage systems is to use rainfall to recharge the water sources of a given site. These water sources are often underlying the , nearby streams, lakes, or other similar freshwater sources. For example, if a site is above an unconsolidated , then SuDS will aim to direct all rain that falls on the surface layer into the underground aquifer as quickly as possible. To accomplish this, SuDS use various forms of permeable layers to ensure the water is not captured or redirected to another location. Often these layers include soil and vegetation, though they can also be artificial materials.\nThe paradigm of SuDS solutions should be that of a system that is easy to manage, requiring little or no energy input (except from environmental sources such as sunlight, etc.), resilient to use, and being environmentally as well as aesthetically attractive. Examples of this type of system are basins (shallow landscape depressions that are dry most of the time when it's not raining),  (shallow landscape depressions with shrub or herbaceous planting),  (shallow normally-dry, wide-based ditches), filter drains (gravel filled trench drain), bioretention basins (shallow depressions with gravel and/or sand filtration layers beneath the growing medium), reed beds and other  habitats that collect, store, and filter dirty water along with providing a habitat for wildlife.\nA common misconception of SuDS is that they reduce flooding on the development site. In fact the SuDS is designed to reduce the impact that the surface water drainage system of one site has on other sites.  For instance, sewer flooding is a problem in many places. Paving or building over land can result in flash flooding. This happens when flows entering a sewer exceed its capacity and it overflows. The SuDS system aims to minimise or eliminate discharges from the site, thus reducing the impact, the idea being that if all development sites incorporated SuDS then urban sewer flooding would be less of a problem. Unlike traditional urban  drainage systems, SuDS can also help to protect and enhance ground water quality.\nBecause SuDS describe a collection of systems with similar components or goals, there is a large crossover between SuDS and other terminologies dealing with sustainable urban development. The following are examples generally accepted as components in a SuDS system: \n \nA bioswale is a shallow depression in a piece of land meant to gather and filter stormwater runoff by directing polluted rainwater through soil and vegetation. Besides the environmental benefits bioswales provide, they are commonly used in public spaces due to their aesthetic qualities and generally low difficulty of installation and maintenance. Bioswales are designed linearly and slightly sloped in order to drain water throughout its components and into the soil as opposed to simply collecting it in a standing location. Although bioswales provide passive means to filter runoff indefinitely, they are limited by their momentary capacity for runoff volume. As such, they can be easily flooded over if rainfall events, adjacent surfaces, and soil characteristics are not adequately considered. \nBioswales are found in various settings across the globe, particularly in densely built urban areas with paved streets. In , a renovation of historic Deaderick Street near the city center included bioswales meant to filter runoff from the street surfaces. Its developers claim that the intervention has reduced the amount of runoff entering Nashville's sewer system by over 1.2 million gallons annually. \n \nPermeable pavement systems aim to provide a manner for water that falls on  to seep through to the soil below. This is accomplished by either dividing traditional pavement materials into sections, or using a porous pavement material.\nIn China, paved urban areas have grown rapidly since the 2000s, with dozens of cities supporting populations over one million. In response, the Chinese government has commissioned the design of several \"\" which employ SuDS at urban scales throughout the country. One such example is , a Shanghai suburb designed to combat rising sea levels on China\u2019s eastern coast. Nanhui, previously known as Lingang, uses permeable pavement for roads and public right-of-ways to reduce the effects large urban infrastructure has on the natural water cycle. It is the organic combination of modern green new technology and society, environment, human culture  for social progress.\n\nArtificial wetlands can be constructed in areas that see large volumes of storm water surges or runoff. Built to replicate shallow marshes, wetlands as BMPs gather and filter water at scales larger than bioswales or rain gardens. Unlike bioswales, artificial wetlands are designed to replicate natural wetlands processes as opposed to having an engineered mechanism within the artificial wetland. Because of this, the ecology of the wetland (soil components, water, vegetation, microbes, sunlight processes, etc.) becomes the primary system to remove pollutants. Water in an artificial wetland tends to be filtered slowly in comparison to systems with mechanized or explicitly engineered components.\n\nWetlands can be used to concentrate large volumes of runoff from urban areas and neighborhoods. In 2012, the South Los Angeles Wetlands Park was constructed in a densely populated inner-city district as a renovation for a former  bus yard. The park is designed to capture runoff from surrounding surfaces as well as storm water overflow from the city's current drainage system.\nDetention basins (or retention basins) are storm water detention areas meant to offset excess water that could overrun the capacity of the current filtration or drainage systems. Detention basins reduce peak discharge into drainage systems by methods including slowing runoff velocity, holding excess volume, and trapping sediment that could disrupt drainage systems downstream. Basins can be either wet or dry, depending on whether the default state of the basin is filled with water or only anticipates it during storm surges.\nXang Thoi Pond in , , is an example of urban retrofitting to reduce flooding through detention basins. C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1, a large city on the , is susceptible to seasonal floods and intense rainfall. In response, the local government included urban flooding solutions as part of a wider national infrastructural initiative.\n\nGreen roofs are landscaped or vegetated areas on the roofs of buildings, usually built to mimic natural landscaping or ground-level parks. Green roofs help drainage systems by offsetting peak discharge from otherwise hardscape surfaces, and filtering rainwater directly as it falls. They also have the added advantage of reducing energy consumption for buildings that would otherwise be receiving direct sunlight onto their roofs throughout the day. \nAs part of the ,  agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as part of a global effort to combat climate change. Consequentially, many of Argentina's cities have passed resolutions requiring or encouraging new developments to implement green roofs. In , the city government provides tax reductions to developments that incorporate green roofs along with other LEED criteria.\n"},

In linking with the pursuit of \u2018\u2019, such markets have a multiple focus on social, environmental and economic outcomes. Sustainable markets aim to reflect the true costs (or ) of  , , and promote just and  practices.\nIn transitioning to sustainable markets, formal rules sometimes called  (MGMS)are key potential tools to shape and govern markets. Examples could include Fairtrade certification, sustainable reporting and metrics, payments for  or other market-based instruments. MGMs change the behaviour of consumers, investors or producers so that their decisions result in more sustainable outcomes. MGMs could provide economic signals or incentives, for example in pricing externalities. Regulatory mechanisms could prohibit or require certain practices by consumers or producers. Or cooperative mechanisms could create voluntary or more formal partnerships around environmental norms or standards.\nThere are a number of contentious issues and ongoing debates around sustainable markets, particularly in how to achieve sustainable markets. There are questions around the appropriate mix of policy instruments or mechanisms, and for which context. For example, a developing world country may require specific mechanisms to build sustainable markets, particularly where more informal or fledgling economies exist. These also involve wider debates over how economic globalisation and trade can benefit countries where local capacities or institutions are weak.\nFurthermore, there are unresolved debates over how much regulation or  is appropriate in order to govern sustainable markets. For example, in pricing pollution like  (GHGs), there are competing arguments over whether there should be government-mandated taxes to limit pollution by economic disincentives or whether a market should determine the price to pollute. In many cases a mixture of both may be favourable.\nBroader questions remain over whether sustainable markets can ever fully account for environmental externalities, such as those associated with pollution. This relates to whether an economic model focused on  rather than wellbeing can truly bring about the transformation outlined in sustainable development. There have been suggestions that a move away from a pure focus on GDP is required, towards an emphasis represented in methods such as  accounting.\nA number of organizations are working in the sustainable markets field.\n"},

Transportation sustainability is largely being measured by transportation system effectiveness and efficiency as well as the  and  impacts of the system.\nShort-term activity often promotes incremental improvement in  and  while long-term goals include migrating transportation from fossil-based energy to other alternatives such as  and use of other .

The advantages of increased mobility need to be weighed against the environmental, social and economic costs that transport systems pose.\nTransport systems have significant impacts on the environment, accounting for between 20% and 25% of  and . The majority of the emissions, almost 97%, came from direct burning of fossil fuels. Greenhouse gas emissions from transport are increasing at a faster rate than any other energy using sector.

These were the only personal transport choices available to most people in Western countries prior to , and remain the only options for most people in the developing world. Freight was moved by human power, animal power or rail.\nThe post-war years brought increased wealth and a demand for much greater mobility for people and goods. The number of road vehicles in Britain increased fivefold between 1950 and 1979, with similar trends in other Western nations. Most affluent countries and cities invested heavily in bigger and better-designed roads and motorways, which were considered essential to underpin growth and prosperity. Transport planning became a branch of  and identified  as a pivotal change from \"predict and provide\" toward a sustainable approach incorporating  and . Public investment in transit, walking and  declined dramatically in the United States, Great Britain and Australia, although this did not occur to the same extent in Canada or mainland Europe.\nConcerns about the sustainability of this approach became widespread during the  and the . The high cost and limited availability of fuel led to a resurgence of interest in alternatives to single occupancy vehicle travel.\nTransport innovations dating from this period include , citywide  systems and .  implemented  in the late 1970s, and  began implementing its  system in the early 1980s.\nRelatively low and stable oil prices during the 1980s and 1990s led to significant increases in vehicle travel from 1980\u20132000, both directly because people chose to travel by car more often and for greater distances, and indirectly because cities developed tracts of suburban housing, distant from shops and from workplaces, now referred to as . Trends in freight logistics, including a movement from rail and coastal shipping to road freight and a requirement for  deliveries, meant that freight traffic grew faster than general vehicle traffic.\nAt the same time, the academic foundations of the \"predict and provide\" approach to transport were being questioned, notably by  in a set of comparative studies of cities and their transport systems dating from the mid-1980s.\n\nThe British Government's White Paper on Transport marked a change in direction for transport planning in the UK. In the introduction to the White Paper, Prime Minister  stated thatWe recognise that we cannot simply build our way out of the problems we face. It would be environmentally irresponsible \u2013 and would not work.\nA companion document to the White Paper called \"Smarter Choices\" researched the potential to scale up the small and scattered sustainable transport initiatives then occurring across Britain, and concluded that the comprehensive application of these techniques could reduce peak period car travel in urban areas by over 20%.\nA similar study by the United States Federal Highway Administration, was also released in 2004 and also concluded that a more proactive approach to transportation demand was an important component of overall national transport strategy.\nTransport systems are major emitters of greenhouse gases, responsible for 23% of world energy-related GHG emissions in 2004, with about three quarters coming from road vehicles. Currently 95% of transport energy comes from petroleum. Energy is consumed in the manufacture as well as the use of vehicles, and is  in transport infrastructure including roads, bridges and railways.\nThe first historical attempts of evaluating the Life Cycle environmental impact of vehicle is due to . After decades in which all the analysis has been focused on emending the Von Karman model, Dewulf and Van Langenhove have introduced a model based on the second law of thermodynamics and exergy analysis. Chester and Orwath, have developed a similar model based on the first law that accounts the necessary costs for the infrastructure.\nThe  can be reduced by reducing the weight of vehicles, sustainable styles of driving, reducing the friction of tires, encouraging electric and hybrid vehicles, improving the walking and  in cities, and by enhancing the role of public transport, especially .\n are intended to have less environmental impact than equivalent standard vehicles, although when the environmental impact of a vehicle is assessed over the whole of its  this may not be the case.\n technology (especially non-battery based vehicles, fuel cell vehicles, ...) has the potential to reduce transport CO emissions, depending on the embodied energy of the vehicle and the source of the electricity. \nThe primary sources of electricity currently used in most countries (coal, gas, oil) mean that until world electricity production changes substantially, private electric cars will result in the same or higher production of  than petrol equivalent vehicles. \nBattery-based electric vehicles may or may not be better in terms of GHG emissions then fossil-fuel based vehicles depending on several factors, such as battery type, capacity of the battery, life expectancy of the battery, ...\nThe Online Electric Vehicle (OLEV), developed by the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), is an electric vehicle that can be charged while stationary or driving, thus removing the need to stop at a charging station. The City of Gumi in South Korea runs a 24\u00a0km roundtrip along which the bus will receive 100\u00a0kW (136 horsepower) electricity at an 85% maximum power transmission efficiency rate while maintaining a 17\u00a0cm air gap between the underbody of the vehicle and the road surface.\nAt that power, only a few sections of the road need embedded cables. , which use an  combined with an  to achieve better  than a regular combustion engine, are already common.\n is also used as a transport fuel but is a less promising, technology as it is still a fossil fuel and still has significant emissions (though lower than gasoline, diesel, ...).\nBrazil met 17% of its transport fuel needs from  in 2007, but the  has warned that the success of (first-generation) biofuels in Brazil is due to specific local circumstances. Internationally, first-generation biofuels are forecast to have little or no impact on greenhouse emissions, at significantly higher cost than energy efficiency measures.\nThe later generation biofuels however (2nd to 4th generation) do have significant environmental benefit, as they are no driving force for deforestation or struggle with the  issue.\nOther  include hydrogen, which (like drop-in biofuels) , don't rely on any crops at all (instead it's produced using electricity) and even generates very little pollution when burned.\nIn practice there is a sliding scale of  depending on the sustainability of the option. Green vehicles are more , but only in comparison with standard vehicles, and they still contribute to traffic congestion and road crashes. Well-patronised  networks based on traditional diesel buses use less fuel per passenger than private vehicles, and are generally safer and use less road space than private vehicles. Green public transport vehicles including electric trains, trams and  combine the advantages of green vehicles with those of sustainable transport choices. Other transport choices with very low environmental impact are  and other , and . The most common green transport choice, with the least environmental impact is .\nTransport on rails boasts an excellent efficiency (see ).\nCities with overbuilt roadways have experienced unintended consequences, linked to radical drops in , , and . In many cases, streets became void of \u201clife.\u201d Stores, schools, government centers and libraries moved away from central cities, and residents who did not flee to the suburbs experienced a much reduced quality of public space and of public services. As schools were closed their mega-school replacements in outlying areas generated additional traffic; the number of cars on US roads between 7:15 and 8:15\u00a0a.m. increases 30% during the school year.\nYet another impact was an increase in , causing and complicating a national epidemic of , and accompanying dramatically increased health care costs.\nCities are shaped by their transport systems. In ,  documented how the location and layout of cities was shaped around a walkable center, often located near a port or waterway, and with suburbs accessible by animal transport or, later, by rail or tram lines.\nIn 1939, the  included a model of an imagined city, built around a car-based transport system. In this \"greater and better world of tomorrow\", residential, commercial and industrial areas were separated, and skyscrapers loomed over a network of urban motorways. These ideas captured the popular imagination, and are credited with influencing city planning from the 1940s to the 1970s.\nThe popularity of the car in the post-war era led to major changes in the structure and function of cities. There was some opposition to these changes at the time. The writings of , in particular  provide a poignant reminder of what was lost in this transformation, and a record of community efforts to resist these changes. Lewis Mumford asked \"is the city for cars or for people?\"  documented the consequences for communities of increasing car traffic in \"The View from the Road\" (1964) and in the UK,  first published research into the impacts of traffic on child independent mobility in 1971. Despite these notes of caution, trends in car ownership, car use and fuel consumption continued steeply upward throughout the post-war period.\nMainstream transport planning in Europe has, by contrast, never been based on assumptions that the private car was the best or only solution for urban mobility. For example, the  Transport Structure Scheme has since the 1970s required that demand for additional vehicle capacity only be met \"if the contribution to societal welfare is positive\", and since 1990 has included an explicit target to halve the rate of growth in vehicle traffic. Some cities outside Europe have also consistently linked transport to sustainability and to , notably ,  and .\nThere are major differences in transport energy consumption between cities; an average U.S. urban dweller uses 24 times more energy annually for  than a Chinese urban resident, and almost four times as much as a European urban dweller. These differences cannot be explained by wealth alone but are closely linked to the rates of , , and  use and to enduring features of the city including  and urban design.\nThe cities and nations that have invested most heavily in car-based transport systems are now the least environmentally sustainable, as measured by per capita  use. The social and economic sustainability of car-based  has also been questioned. Within the United States, residents of  cities make more frequent and longer car trips, while residents of traditional urban neighbourhoods make a similar number of trips, but travel shorter distances and walk, cycle and use transit more often. It has been calculated that New York residents save $19 billion each year simply by owning fewer cars and driving less than the average American. A less car intensive means of urban transport is , which is becoming popular in North America and Europe, and according to , carsharing can reduce car ownership at an estimated rate of one rental car replacing 15 owned vehicles. Car sharing has also begun in the developing world, where traffic and urban density is often worse than in developed countries. Companies like  in India, eHi in China, and Carrot in Mexico, are bringing car-sharing to developing countries in an effort to reduce car-related pollution, ameliorate traffic, and expand the number of people who have access to cars.\nThe  adopted the  on 30 September 2009 for sustainable urban mobility. The European Commission will conduct a review of the implementation of the Action Plan in the year 2012, and will assess the need for further action. In 2007, 72% of the European population lived in urban areas, which are key to growth and employment. Cities need efficient transport systems to support their economy and the welfare of their inhabitants. Around 85% of the EU's  is generated in cities. Urban areas face today the challenge of making transport sustainable in environmental (, , ) and competitiveness () terms while at the same time addressing social concerns. These range from the need to respond to  problems and  trends, fostering economic and social cohesion to taking into account the needs of , families and children.\nThe  (C40) is a group of 94 cities around the world driving urban action that reduces greenhouse gas emissions and climate risks, while increasing the health and wellbeing of urban citizens. In October 2019, by signing the C40 Clean Air Cities Declaration, 35 mayors recognised that breathing clean air is a human right and committed to work together to form a global coalition for clean air.\nSustainable transport policies have their greatest impact at the city level. \nSome of the biggest cities in Western Europe have a relatively sustainable transport. In  53% of trips are made by walking, 3% by bicycle, 34% by public transport, and only 10% by car. In the entire  region, walking is the most popular way of transportation. In ,  28% of trips are made by walking, 31%  by bicycle, 18% by public transport and only 23% by car. In  62% of people commute to school or work by bicycle.\nOutside Western Europe, cities which have consistently included sustainability as a key consideration in transport and land use planning include ; ; ; and . The ,  passed legislation in 2010 \u2013 the  \u2013 to compel its transport agencies to actively consider sustainability issues including climate change impacts in transport policy, planning and operations.\nMany other cities throughout the world have recognised the need to link sustainability and transport policies, for example by joining the .\nSome cities are trying to become , e.g., limit or exclude the usage of cars.\nIn 2020, the  pushed several cities to adopt a plan to drastically increase  and ; these included , , , and . These plans were taken to facilitate  by avoiding public transport and at the same time prevent a rise in  and air pollution from increase in car use. A similar plan was adopted by  and .\nSustainable transport is fundamentally a grassroots movement, albeit one which is now recognised as of citywide, national and international significance.\nWhereas it started as a movement driven by environmental concerns, over these last years there has been increased emphasis on social equity and fairness issues, and in particular the need to ensure proper access and services for lower income groups and people with mobility limitations, including the fast-growing population of older citizens. Many of the people exposed to the most vehicle noise, pollution and safety risk have been those who do not own, or cannot drive cars, and those for whom the cost of car ownership causes a severe financial burden.\nAn organization called  started in 2011 created a national awareness campaign in the United States encouraging people to  by ride-sharing cross country stopping over at various destinations along the way and documenting their travel through video footage, posts and photography. Ride-sharing reduces individual's carbon footprint by allowing several people to use one car instead of everyone using individual cars.\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, some companies are trying to increase the use of , even for commercial purposes, for example, Fairtrannsport and New Dawn Traders They have created the .\nCar travel increased steadily throughout the twentieth century, but trends since 2000 have been more complex.  have been linked to a decline in per capita fuel use for private vehicle travel in the US, Britain and Australia. In 2008, global oil consumption fell by 0.8% overall, with significant declines in consumption in North America, Western Europe, and parts of Asia.\nOther factors affecting a decline in driving, at least in America, include the retirement of  who now drive less, preference for other travel modes (such as transit) by younger age cohorts, the , and the rising use of technology (internet, mobile devices) which have made travel less necessary and possibly less attractive.\nSeveral European countries are opening up financial incentives that support more sustainable modes of transport. The , which focuses on daily cycling for transport, has created a document containing a non-complete overview. In the , employers have for many years been providing employees with financial incentives. The employee leases or borrows a bike that the employer has purchased. You can also get other support. The scheme is beneficial for the employee who saves money and gets an incentive to get exercise integrated in the daily routine. The employer can expect a tax deduction, lower sick leave and less pressure on parking spaces for cars. Since 2010, there has been a scheme in  (Samg\u00f6ngugrei\u00f0slur) where those who do not drive a car to work, get paid a lump of money monthly. An employee must sign a statement not to use a car for work more often than one day a week, or 20% of the days for a period. Some employers pay fixed amounts based on trust. Other employers reimburse the expenses for repairs on bicycles, period-tickets for public transport and the like. Since 2013, amounts up to ISK 8000 per month have been tax-free. Most major workplaces offer this, and a significant proportion of employees use the scheme. Since 2019 half the amount is tax-free if the employee signs a contract not to use a car to work for more than 40% of the days of the contract period.\nThe term  is often used as a  marketing technique for products which are not proven to make a positive contribution to environmental sustainability. Such claims can be legally challenged. For instance Norway's  has targeted  who claim that their cars are \"green\", \"clean\" or \"\". Manufacturers risk fines if they fail to drop the words. The  (ACCC) describes \"green\" claims on products as \"very vague, inviting consumers to give a wide range of meanings to the claim, which risks misleading them\". In 2008 the ACCC forced a car retailer to stop its  marketing of Saab cars, which was found by the Australian Federal Court to be \"misleading\".\nThe   (DG-TREN) has launched a programme which focusses mostly on urban transport. Its main measures are:\n"},

They cluster under different groupings and the whole is sometimes referred to as \"green capitalism\". Often, sustainable businesses have progressive environmental and  policies. In general,  is described as green if it matches the following four criteria:\nA sustainable business is any organization that participates in environmentally friendly or green activities to ensure that all processes, products, and manufacturing activities adequately address current environmental concerns while maintaining a profit. In other words, it is a business that \u201cmeets the needs of the present [world] without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\u201d It is the process of assessing how to design products that will take advantage of the current environmental situation and how well a company\u2019s products perform with renewable resources.\nThe  emphasized that sustainability is a three-legged stool of people, planet, and profit. Sustainable businesses with the supply chain try to balance all three through the triple-bottom-line concept\u2014using sustainable development and  to affect the environment, business growth, and the society.\nEveryone affects the  of the marketplace and the planet in some way. Sustainable development within a business can create value for customers, investors, and the environment. A sustainable business must meet customer needs while, at the same time, treating the environment well. To succeed in such an approach, where stakeholder balancing and joint solutions are key, requires a structural approach. One philosophy, that include many different tools and methods, is the concept of Sustainable Enterprise Excellence. Another is the adoption of the concept of responsible growth.\nSustainability is often confused with  (CSR), though the two are not the same. Bansal and DesJardine (2014) state that the notion of \u2018time\u2019 discriminates sustainability from CSR and other similar concepts.  Whereas ethics, morality, and norms permeate CSR, sustainability only obliges businesses to make intertemporal trade-offs to safeguard intergenerational equity. Short-termism is the bane of sustainability.\nGreen business has been seen as a possible mediator of economic-environmental relations, and if proliferated, would serve to diversify our economy, even if it has a negligible effect at lowering atmospheric CO levels. The definition of \"green jobs\" is ambiguous, but it is generally agreed that these jobs, the result of green business, should be linked to clean energy, and contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gases. These corporations can be seen as generators of not only \"green energy\", but as producers of new \"materialities\" that are the product of the technologies these firms developed and deployed.\nA major initiative of sustainable businesses is to eliminate or decrease the environmental harm caused by the production and consumption of their goods. The impact of such human activities in terms of the amount of greenhouse gases produced can be measured in units of carbon dioxide and is referred to as the . The carbon footprint concept is derived from ecological footprint analysis, which examines the ecological capacity required to support the consumption of products.\nBusinesses take a wide range of green initiatives. One of the most common examples is the act of \"going paperless\" or sending electronic correspondence in lieu of paper when possible. On a higher level, examples of sustainable business practices include:  (e.g., tuning up lightly used commercial fitness equipment for resale);  to eliminate waste (such as using a more accurate template to cut out designs); and choosing nontoxic raw materials and processes. For example, Canadian farmers have found that hemp is a sustainable alternative to rapeseed in their traditional ; hemp grown for fiber or seed requires no pesticides or herbicides.\nSustainable business leaders also take into account the  for the items they produce. Input costs must be considered in regards to regulations, energy use, storage, and disposal.  (DFE) is also an element of sustainable business. This process enables users to consider the potential environmental impacts of a product and the process used to make that product.\nThe many possibilities for adopting green practices have led to considerable pressure being put upon companies from consumers, employees, government regulators and other stakeholders. Some companies have resorted to  instead of making meaningful changes, merely marketing their products in ways that suggest green practices. For example, various producers in the bamboo fiber industry have been taken to court for advertising their products as more \"green\" than they are. Still, countless other companies have taken the sustainability trend seriously and are enjoying profits. In their book \u201cCorporate Sustainability in International Comparison\u201d, Schaltegger et al. (2014) analyse the current state of corporate sustainability management and corporate social responsibility across eleven countries. Their research is based on an extensive survey focusing on the companies\u2019 intention to pursue sustainability management (i.e. motivation; issues), the integration of sustainability in the organisation (i.e. connecting sustainability to the core business; involving corporate functions; using drivers of business cases for sustainability) and the actual implementation of sustainability management measures (i.e. stakeholder management; sustainability management tools and standards; measurements). The  written by Richard Seireeni, (2009), documents the experiences of sustainable businesses in America and their reliance on the vast but invisible green community, referred to as the , for support and a market.\nGreen investment firms are consequently attracting unprecedented interest. In the UK, for instance, the  is devoted exclusively to supporting renewable domestic energy. However, the UK and Europe as a whole are falling behind the impressive pace set by developing nations in terms of green development. Thus, green investment firms are creating more and more opportunities to support sustainable development practices in emerging economies. By providing  and larger investments, these firms assist small business owners in developing nations who seek business education, affordable loans, and new distribution networks for their \"green\" products.\nThe Harvard Business School business historian  has traced the historical origins of green business back to pioneering start-ups in organic food and wind and solar energy before World War 1. Among large corporations,  occupies an odd role in the story of sustainability. Ironically, founder  was a pioneer in the sustainable business realm, experimenting with plant-based fuels during the days of the Model T. Ford Motor Company also shipped the Model A truck in crates that then became the vehicle floorboards at the factory destination. This was a form of , retaining high quality in a closed-loop industrial cycle. Furthermore, the original auto body was made of a stronger-than-steel hemp composite. Today, of course, Fords aren't made of hemp nor do they run on the most sensible fuel. Currently, Ford's claim to eco-friendly fame is the use of seat fabric made from 100% post-industrial materials and renewable soy foam seat bases. Ford executives recently appointed the company\u2019s first senior vice president of sustainability, environment, and safety engineering. This position is responsible for establishing a long-range sustainability strategy and environmental policy. The person in this position will also help develop the products and processes necessary to satisfy both customers and society as a whole while working toward energy independence. It remains to be seen whether Ford will return to its founder's vision of a petroleum-free automobile, a vehicle powered by the remains of plant matter.\nThe automobile manufacturer  is a sustainability giant. In 2008 a Subaru assembly plant in Lafayette became the first auto manufacturer to achieve zero land fill status when the plant implemented sustainable policies. The company successfully managed to implement a plan that increased refuse recycling to 99.8%. In 2012, the corporation increased the reuse of Styrofoam by 9%. And from the year 2008 to the year 2012, environmental incidents and accidents reduced from 18 to 4.\nSmaller companies such as , an organic cereal and snack making business, have also made significant sustainability gains in the 21st century. CEO  and his associates have ensured that the quickly growing company's products are produced without toxic farm chemicals. Furthermore, employees are constantly encouraged to find ways to reduce consumption. Sustainability is an essential part of corporate discussions. Another example comes from , a company created in 1996 as a , , coffee producer. In recent years they have become , lowering emissions by reducing long-range trucking and using  in delivery trucks, upgrading to energy efficient equipment and purchasing . The company claims to offer the first carbon neutral coffee sold in Canada. Salt Spring Coffee was recognized by the  in the 2010 report . A third example comes from Korea, where rice husks are used as a nontoxic packaging for stereo components and other electronics. The same material is later recycled to make bricks.\nThe  and specifically  industries are also moving towards more sustainable practices, especially given that the industry is one of the most environmentally destructive. Indeed, regarding gold mining,  scientists have, in the laboratory, discovered an inexpensive and environmentally sustainable method that uses simple \u2014instead of \u2014to isolate gold from raw materials in a selective manner. Such a method will reduce the amount of  released into the environment during gold extraction from raw , with one of the  scientists, Sir Fraser Stoddart stating that: \u201cThe elimination of cyanide from the gold industry is of the utmost importance environmentally\". Additionally, the retail jewelry industry is now trying to be totally sustainable, with companies using green energy providers and  more, as well as preventing the use of mined-so called 'virgin gold' by applying re-finishing methods on pieces and re-selling them. Furthermore, the customer may opt for  Gold, which gives a better deal to small scale and  miners, and is an element of sustainable business. However, not all think that mining can be sustainable and much more must be done, noting that mining in general is in need of greater regional and international legislation and regulation, which is a valid point given the huge impact mining has on the planet and the huge number of products and goods that are made wholly or partly from  materials.\nOrganizations that give back to the community, whether through employees volunteering their time or through charitable donations are often considered . Organizations also can encourage education in their communities by training their employees and offering internships to younger members of the community. Practices such as these increase the education level and quality of life in the community.\nFor a business to be truly sustainable, it must sustain not only the necessary environmental resources, but also social resources\u2014including employees, customers (the community), and its reputation.\nThe European community\u2019s  restricts the use of certain hazardous materials in the production of various electronic and electrical products.  () directives provide collection, recycling, and recovery practices for electrical goods.  The  and the  are two organizations working together to set a standard for reporting on corporate .  From October 2013, all quoted companies in the UK are legally required to report their annual greenhouse gas emissions in their directors\u2019 report, under the  (Strategic and Directors\u2019 Reports) Regulations 2013.\n\u2019s  and \u2019s  provide information on sustainability initiatives.\nCorporate sustainability strategies can aim to take advantage of sustainable revenue opportunities, while protecting the value of business against increasing energy costs, the costs of meeting regulatory requirements, changes in the way customers perceive brands and products, and the volatile price of resources.\nNot all eco-strategies can be incorporated into a company's Eco-portfolio immediately. The widely practiced strategies include: Innovation, Collaboration, Process Improvement and Sustainability reporting. \nThis introverted method of sustainable corporate practices focuses on a company's ability to change its products and services towards less waste production and sustainable best practices.\nThe formation of networks with similar or partner companies facilitates knowledge sharing and propels innovation.\nContinuous process surveying and improvement is essential to reduction in waste. Employee awareness of company-wide sustainability plan further aids the integration of new and improved processes.\nPeriodic reporting of company performance in relation to goals. These goals are often incorporated into the corporate mission (as in the case of Ford Motor Co.).\nSustainable procurement is important for any sustainability strategy as a company's impact on the environment is much bigger than the products that they consume. The  model is a good example of one that encourages companies to focus on this.\nAdditionally, companies might consider implementing a sound measurement and management system with readjustment procedures, as well as a regular forum for all stakeholders to discuss sustainablity issues. The Sustainability Balanced Scorecard is a performance measurement and management system aiming at balancing financial and non-financial as well as short and long-term measures. It explicitly integrates strategically relevant environmental, social and ethical goals into the overall performance management system  and supports strategic sustainability management.\nEnormous economic and population growth worldwide in the second half of the twentieth century aggravated the factors that threaten health and the world \u2014 , , depletion, fouling of natural resources, and extensive  and . In the past, the standard approaches to environmental problems generated by business and industry have been regulatory-driven \"end-of-the-pipe\" remediation efforts. In the 1990s, efforts by governments, , corporations, and investors began to grow substantially to develop awareness and plans for investment in business sustainability.\nOne critical milestone was the establishment of the  standards whose development came as a result of the  held in 1992.  is the cornerstone standard of the  series. It specifies a framework of control for an Environmental Management System against which an organization can be certified by a third party. Other  Series Standards are actually guidelines, many to help you achieve registration to ISO 14001. They include the following:\nWhile the initial focus of academic, industry, and policy activities was mainly focused on the development of re-X (recycling, remanufacturing, reuse,...) technology, it soon became clear that the technological capabilities increasingly exceed their implementation. To leverage this technology for the transition towards a Circular Economy, different stakeholders have to work together. This shifted attention towards business model innovation as a key leverage for 'circular' technology adaption.\nCircular business models are business models that are closing, narrowing, slowing, intensifying, and dematerialising loops, to minimise the resource inputs into and the waste and emission leakage out of the organisational system. This comprises recycling measures (closing), efficiency improvements (narrowing), use phase extensions (slowing or extending), a more intense use phase (intensifying), and the substitution of product utility by service and software solutions (dematerialising).\nThe  standards were developed by the US Green Building Council in an effort to propel green building design in the United States. LEED certification is very prestigious title and can be attained through \"compliance with all environmental laws and regulations, occupancy scenarios, building permanence and pre-rating completion, site boundaries and area-to-site ratios, and obligatory five-year sharing of whole building energy and water use data from the start of occupancy (for new construction) or date of certification (for existing buildings)\".[15].\nImplementing sustainable business practices may have an effect on profits and a firm's financial 'bottom line'. At first blush, this challenge might make many corporate executives cringe. However, during a time where environmental awareness is popular, green strategies are likely to be embraced by employees, consumers, and other stakeholders. In fact, according to many studies, a positive correlation exists between environmental performance and economic performance.\nIf an organisation\u2019s current business model is inherently unsustainable, becoming a truly sustainable business requires a complete makeover of the business model (e.g. from selling cars to offering car sharing and other mobility services). This can present a major challenge due to the differences between the old and the new model and the respective skills, resources and infrastructure needed. A new business model can also offer major opportunities by entering or even creating new markets and reaching new customer groups.\nCompanies leading the way in sustainable business practices can be said to be taking advantage of sustainable revenue opportunities: according to the  the UK green economy to grow by 4.9 to 5.5 percent a year by 2015, and the average internal rate of return on energy efficiency investments for large businesses is 48%.  A 2013 survey suggests that demand for green products appears to be increasing: 27% of respondents said they are more likely to buy a sustainable product and/or service than 5 years ago. Furthermore, sustainable business practices may attract  and generate .\n"},

Unlike many business organizations, sustainability organizations are not limited to implementing  strategies which provide them with economic and cultural benefits attained through . For sustainability , sustainability can also be an end in itself without further justifications.\nRecently, the natural environment has become a key strategic issue in both the  and .  Through \"implementing sustainability strategies, firms can integrate long-run profitability with their efforts to protect the , providing them with opportunities to achieve the traditional competitive advantages and cost leadership and market differentiation via environmental responsibility\". Sustainability strategies have been persistently employed in a number of organizations.\nA sustainable system generally can be defined in environmental terminology as \"a living system which operates in a way that it does not use up resources more quickly than they can be naturally replenished;  a sustainable economic system operates in a way so that expenditures are either equal or less than the income.\"  Sustainable social systems maintain that all members are allowed to contribute, thereby synthesizing the final product. \n\n refers to \"a company\u2019s activities, voluntary by definition, demonstrating the inclusion of social and environmental concerns in business operations and in interactions with stakeholders\".\nEach individual organization should choose its own particular goals and approaches as they pertain to corporate sustainability, matching the organization's aims and intentions and aligning with the organization's strategy, as an appropriate response to the conditions in which it functions.\nReducing wastage\nSustainable agriculture incorporates design and management procedures that coincide with natural processes in order to conserve all resources and minimize waste production and damage to natural systems, while preserving or improving farm profitability.  Sustainable agriculture systems are \"designed to take the greatest advantage of current soil nutrient and water cycles, energy flows, beneficial soil organisms, and natural pest controls.  These systems also seek to produce food that is nutritious yet uncontaminated with products such as synthetically compound fertilizers, pesticides, growth regulators, and livestock feed additives.  Sustainable agriculture systems often depend on crop rotations, crop residues, animal manures, legumes, green manures, off-farm organic wastes, appropriate mechanical cultivation or minimal tillage to optimize soil biological and natural pest control activity in order to maintain soil fertility and crop productivity.\"\nAlso, resistant species varieties, and biological and cultural controls are implemented to control pests, weeds and diseases. Sustainable agriculture organizations aim to educate and encourage farmers to implement sustainable agriculture practices into their productions.  Many sponsor research and education outreach projects.\n\n\"By using more efficient building methods and materials, it is estimated that we could reduce the energy,  and / or waste production by 50\u201360% without decreasing value, aesthetics or function.\" Taking the Earth's finite resources into consideration, along with acknowledging that manufactured products, including all building materials, affect the Earth's resources, it is becoming very important to make sensible decisions regarding the use of these limited resources to preserve our natural environment along with human civilization.  Increased use of resource efficient construction materials and methods will help to induce more sustainable practices throughout the building and construction industry.\n\nSustainable business organizations participate in environmentally friendly or green practices in order to make certain that all processes, products, and manufacturing activities sufficiently address current environmental concerns while still retaining a profit. Concurrently, it is a business that \u201cmeets the needs of the present world without compromising the ability of the future generations to meet their own needs. It is the method of evaluating how to design products that will correspond to current environmental conditions and how well a company's products perform with renewable resources. There are many organizations and networks currently interacting with businesses in order to integrate sustainability into their central goals and contribute to the environmentally and socially responsible business movement.\n\nSustainable community organizations often encourage and cultivate collaborative community projects and education programs that improve connections between businesses, institutions and the public with their communities, the natural environment, and each other.  For example, the Sustainable Community Initiatives organization: \n\nDespite the fact that some places may be similar in economic terms, the characteristics of a sustainable business model vary from community to community.  Many organizations aim to assist communities in developing economic opportunities for all citizens.  Some programs exist that \"assist individuals in obtaining employment, that create jobs and that help individuals become economically self-sufficient.\" \n\nEnvironmental sustainability is the \"long-term maintenance of ecosystem components and functions for future generations.\"  In addition, environmental sustainability is the process of making sure current processes of interaction with the environment are pursued with the idea of keeping the environment as unspoiled as naturally possible.  It maintains that the Earth's resources must not be depleted faster than they can naturally be replenished.  Depletion of our finite resources inevitably tries the ability of human civilizations to persist.\n\n\"Regulations, incentives and policies affecting sustainable agriculture are rooted in environmental legislation and laws on the international, Federal, state and local level.\"\n\n\n\nNonprofit organizations \"play a part in society through their social value creation.\"  Many nonprofit organizations have adopted an organizational sustainability focus in both strategic and operational levels of management.  Present nonprofit organizations have been required to adopt strategies aimed at establishing viable, sustainable organizations so that they can maintain to pursue their social mission.   \n\n\n organizations aim to reduce the  of the human species by encouraging and promoting ethical policies and practices that will result in lower levels of population.\nNotable population concern organizations include  and .\nOrganizations that offer global education resources, products, and services.

From this statement, the natural conclusion is that sustainable living is at odds with industrialization. Thus, practitioners of the philosophy potentially face the challenge of living in an industrial society and adapting alternative norms, technologies, or practices.\nAdditionally, practical  builders like  maintain that the shift to alternative technologies will only be successful if the resultant built environment is attractive to a local  and can be maintained and adapted as necessary over multiple generations.\nSustainable living is fundamentally the application of  to lifestyle choice and decisions.  One conception of sustainable living expresses what it means in triple-bottom-line terms as meeting present ecological, societal, and economical needs without compromising these factors for . Another broader conception describes sustainable living in terms of four interconnected  domains: economics, ecology, politics and culture. In the first conception, sustainable living can be described as living within the innate  defined by these factors. In the second or  conception, sustainable living can be described as negotiating the relationships of needs within limits across all the interconnected domains of social life, including consequences for future human generations and non-human .\n and  are critical factors to sustainable living. Sustainable design encompasses the development of , which is a staple of sustainable living practices.  Sustainable development in turn is the use of these technologies in infrastructure.  and  are the most common examples of this practice.\nOn a global scale, shelter is associated with about 25% of the  emissions embodied in household purchases and 26% of households' .\n are built using sustainable methods, materials, and facilitate green practices, enabling a more sustainable lifestyle. Their construction and maintenance have neutral impacts on the Earth. Often, if necessary, they are close in proximity to essential services such as grocery stores, schools, daycares, work, or public transit making it possible to commit to sustainable transportation choices. Sometimes, they are  homes that do not require any public energy, water, or sewer service.\nIf not off-the-grid, sustainable homes may be linked to a grid supplied by a  that is using sustainable power sources, buying power as is normal convention. Additionally, sustainable homes may be connected to a grid, but generate their own electricity through renewable means and sell any excess to a utility. There are two common methods to approaching this option:  and double metering.\nNet metering uses the common meter that is installed in most homes, running forward when power is used from the grid, and running backward when power is put into the grid (which allows them to \u201cnet\u201c out their total energy use, putting excess energy into the grid when not needed, and using energy from the grid during peak hours, when you may not be able to produce enough immediately). Power companies can quickly purchase the power that is put back into the grid, as it is being produced. Double metering involves installing two meters: one measuring electricity consumed, the other measuring electricity created. Additionally, or in place of selling their , sustainable home owners may choose to bank their excess energy by using it to charge batteries. This gives them the option to use the power later during less favorable power-generating times (i.e.: night-time, when there has been no wind, etc.), and to be completely independent of the .\nSustainably designed (see ) houses are generally sited so as to create as little of a negative impact on the surrounding  as possible, oriented to the sun so that it creates the best possible  (typically, the long axis of the house or building should be oriented east-west), and provide natural shading or wind barriers where and when needed, among many other considerations. The design of a sustainable shelter affords the options it has later (i.e.: using , creating temperature buffer zones by adding porches, deep overhangs to help create favorable microclimates, etc.)  Sustainably constructed houses involve environmentally friendly management of waste building materials such as recycling and composting, use non-toxic and renewable, recycled, reclaimed, or low-impact production materials that have been created and treated in a sustainable fashion (such as using organic or water-based finishes), use as much locally available materials and tools as possible so as to reduce the need for transportation, and use low-impact production methods (methods that minimize effects on the environment).\nIn April 2019, New York City passed a bill to cut  emissions. The bill\u2019s goal was to minimize the  stemming from the hub that is New York City. It was approved in a 42 to 5 vote, showing a strong favor of the bill. The bill will restrict energy use in larger buildings. The bill imposes greenhouse gas caps on buildings that are over 25,000 square feet. The calculation of the exact cap is done by square feet per building. A similar emission cap had existed already for buildings of 50,000 square feet or more. This bill expands the legislation to cover more large buildings. The bill protects  buildings of which there are around 990,000. Due to the implementation of the bill, around 23,000 new  will be created. The bill received support from Mayor . New York is taking action based on the recognition that their climate pollution has effects far beyond the city limits of New York. In discussion of a possible new  headquarters in NYC, De Blasio specified that the bill applies to everyone, regardless of prestige. DeBlasio also announced a lawsuit by the city (of New York) to five major oil companies due to their harm on the environment and climate pollution. This also raises the question of the possible closing of the 24 oil and gas burning power plants in New York City, due to the aimed declining use of these sources of energy. With the emission cap, New York will likely see a turn to renewable energy sources. It is possible that these plants will be transitioned to hubs of  to power the city. This new bill will go into action in three years (2022) and is estimated to cut climate pollution by 40% in eight years (by 2030).\nMany materials can be considered a \u201cgreen\u201d material until its background is revealed. Any material that has used toxic or  chemicals in its treatment or manufacturing (such as  in glues used in ), has traveled extensively from its source or manufacturer, or has been cultivated or harvested in an unsustainable manner might not be considered green. In order for any material to be considered green, it must be resource efficient, not compromise  or , and be energy efficient (both in processing and when in use in the shelter). Resource efficiency can be achieved by using as much recycled content, reusable or recyclable content, materials that employ recycled or , locally available material, salvaged or remanufactured material, material that employs resource efficient manufacturing, and long-lasting material as possible.\nSome building materials might be considered \"sustainable\" by some definitions and under some conditions.  For example,  wood might be thought of as sustainable if it is grown using , processed using .  delivered by , etc.:  Under different conditions, however, it might not be considered as sustainable.  The following materials might be considered as sustainable under certain conditions, based on a .\n of a sustainable home is important because of the energy it conserves throughout the life of the home. Well insulated walls and lofts using green materials are a must as it reduces or, in combination with a house that is well designed, eliminates the need for heating and cooling altogether. Installation of insulation varies according to the type of insulation being used. Typically, lofts are insulated by strips of insulating material laid between rafters. Walls with cavities are done in much the same manner. For walls that do not have cavities behind them, solid-wall insulation may be necessary which can decrease internal space and can be expensive to install. Energy-efficient windows are another important factor in insulation. Simply assuring that windows (and doors) are well sealed greatly reduces energy loss in a home.  Double or Triple glazed windows are the typical method to insulating windows, trapping gas or creating a vacuum between two or three panes of glass allowing heat to be trapped inside or out.  or Low-E glass is another option for window insulation. It is a coating on windowpanes of a thin, transparent layer of metal oxide and works by reflecting heat back to its source, keeping the interior warm during the winter and cool during the summer. Simply hanging heavy-backed curtains in front of windows may also help their insulation. \u201cSuperwindows,\u201d mentioned in , became available in the 1980s and use a combination of many available technologies, including two to three transparent low-e coatings, multiple panes of glass, and a heavy gas filling. Although more expensive, they are said to be able to insulate four and a half times better than a typical double-glazed windows.\nEquipping roofs with highly reflective material (such as aluminum) increases a roof's  and will help reduce the amount of heat it absorbs, hence, the amount of energy needed to cool the building it is on.  or \u201cliving roofs\u201d are a popular choice for thermally insulating a building. They are also popular for their ability to catch storm-water runoff and, when in the broader picture of a community, reduce the heat island effect (see ) thereby reducing energy costs of the entire area. It is arguable that they are able to replace the physical \u201cfootprint\u201d that the building creates, helping reduce the adverse environmental impacts of the building's presence.\n and water conservation are also major considerations in sustainable housing. If using appliances, computers,  systems, electronics, or lighting the sustainable-minded often look for an  label, which is government-backed and holds stricter regulations in energy and water efficiency than is required by law. Ideally, a sustainable shelter should be able to completely run the appliances it uses using renewable energy and should strive to have a neutral impact on the Earth's water sources\n, including water from washing machines, sinks, showers, and baths may be reused in landscape  and toilets as a method of water conservation. Likewise,  from storm-water runoff is also a sustainable method to conserve water use in a sustainable shelter.  replicate the natural systems that clean water in wildlife and implement them in a city's drainage system so as to minimize contaminated water and unnatural rates of runoff into the environment.\nSee related articles in:  (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design)\nand also it is one of the most important factor of sustainable lifestyle\nAs mentioned under Shelter, some sustainable households may choose to produce their own renewable energy, while others may choose to purchase it through the grid from a power company that harnesses sustainable sources (also mentioned previously are the methods of metering the production and consumption of electricity in a household). Purchasing sustainable energy, however, may simply not be possible in some locations due to its limited availability. 6 out of the 50 states in the US do not offer , for example. For those that do, its consumers typically buy a fixed amount or a percentage of their monthly consumption from a company of their choice and the bought green energy is fed into the entire national grid. Technically, in this case, the green energy is not being fed directly to the household that buys it. In this case, it is possible that the amount of green electricity that the buying household receives is a small fraction of their total incoming electricity. This may or may not depend on the amount being purchased. The purpose of buying green electricity is to support their utility's effort in producing sustainable energy. Producing sustainable energy on an individual household or community basis is much more flexible, but can still be limited in the richness of the sources that the location may afford (some locations may not be rich in renewable energy sources while others may have an abundance of it).\nWhen generating renewable energy and feeding it back into the grid (in participating countries such as the US and Germany), producing households are typically paid at least the full standard electricity rate by their utility and are also given separate renewable energy credits that they can then sell to their utility, additionally (utilities are interested in buying these renewable energy credits because it allows them to claim that they produce renewable energy). In some special cases, producing households may be paid up to four times the standard electricity rate, but this is not common.\nSolar power harnesses the energy of the sun to make electricity. Two typical methods for converting solar energy into electricity are  that are organized into panels and , which uses mirrors to concentrate sunlight to either heat a fluid that runs an  via a  or , or to simply cast onto photo-voltaic cells. The energy created by photo-voltaic cells is a  and has to be converted to  before it can be used in a household. At this point, users can choose to either store this direct current in batteries for later use, or use an AC/DC inverter for immediate use. To get the best out of a solar panel, the  of the sun should be between 20 and 50 degrees. Solar power via photo-voltaic cells are usually the most expensive method to harnessing renewable energy, but is falling in price as technology advances and public interest increases. It has the advantages of being portable, easy to use on an individual basis, readily available for government grants and incentives, and being flexible regarding location (though it is most efficient when used in hot, arid areas since they tend to be the most sunny). For those that are lucky, affordable rental schemes may be found. Concentrated solar power plants are typically used on more of a community scale rather than an individual household scale, because of the amount of energy they are able to harness but can be done on an individual scale with a .\n is harnessed by collecting direct heat from the sun. One of the most common ways that this method is used by households is through . In a broad perspective, these systems involve well insulated tanks for storage and collectors, are either passive or active systems (active systems have pumps that continuously circulate water through the collectors and storage tank) and, in active systems, involve either directly heating the water that will be used or heating a non-freezing heat-transfer fluid that then heats the water that will be used. Passive systems are cheaper than active systems since they do not require a pumping system (instead, they take advantage of the natural movement of hot water rising above cold water to cycle the water being used through the collector and storage tank).\nOther methods of harnessing solar power are  (for heating internal building spaces), solar drying (for drying wood chips, fruits, grains, etc.), , , and other  technologies (simply, harnessing sunlight without any mechanical means).\n is harnessed through turbines, set on tall towers (typically 20\u2019 or 6m with 10\u2018 or 3m diameter blades for an individual household's needs) that power a generator that creates electricity. They typically require an average of wind speed of 9\u00a0mi/hr (14\u00a0km/hr) to be worth their investment (as prescribed by the US Department of Energy), and are capable of paying for themselves within their lifetimes. Wind turbines in urban areas usually need to be mounted at least 30\u2019 (10m) in the air to receive enough wind and to be void of nearby obstructions (such as neighboring buildings). Mounting a wind turbine may also require permission from authorities. Wind turbines have been criticized for the noise they produce, their appearance, and the argument that they can affect the migratory patterns of birds (their blades obstruct passage in the sky). Wind turbines are much more feasible for those living in rural areas and are one of the most cost-effective forms of renewable energy per kilowatt, approaching the cost of fossil fuels, and have quick paybacks.\nFor those that have a body of water flowing at an adequate speed (or falling from an adequate height) on their property,  may be an option. On a large scale, hydroelectricity, in the form of dams, has adverse environmental and social impacts. When on a small scale, however, in the form of single turbines, hydroelectricity is very sustainable. Single water turbines or even a group of single turbines are not environmentally or socially disruptive. On an individual household basis, single turbines are the probably the only economically feasible route (but can have high paybacks and is one of the most efficient methods of renewable energy production). It is more common for an eco-village to use this method rather than a singular household.\n production involves harnessing the hot water or steam below the earth's surface, in reservoirs, to produce energy. Because the hot water or steam that is used is reinjected back into the reservoir, this source is considered sustainable. However, those that plan on getting their electricity from this source should be aware that there is controversy over the lifespan of each geothermal reservoir as some believe that their lifespans are naturally limited (they cool down over time, making geothermal energy production there eventually impossible). This method is often large scale as the system required to harness geothermal energy can be complex and requires deep drilling equipment. There do exist small individual scale geothermal operations, however, which harness reservoirs very close to the Earth's surface, avoiding the need for extensive drilling and sometimes even taking advantage of lakes or ponds where there is already a depression. In this case, the heat is captured and sent to a  system located inside the shelter or facility that needs it (often, this heat is used directly to warm a greenhouse during the colder months). Although geothermal energy is available everywhere on Earth, practicality and cost-effectiveness varies, directly related to the depth required to reach reservoirs. Places such as the Philippines, Hawaii,  Alaska, Iceland, California, and Nevada have geothermal reservoirs closer to the Earth's surface, making its production cost-effective.\n is created when any biological matter is burned as fuel. As with the case of using green materials in a household, it is best to use as much locally available material as possible so as to reduce the carbon footprint created by transportation. Although burning biomass for fuel releases , sulfur compounds, and nitrogen compounds into the atmosphere, a major concern in a sustainable lifestyle, the amount that is released is sustainable (it will not contribute to a rise in carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere). This is because the biological matter that is being burned releases the same amount of carbon dioxide that it consumed during its lifetime. However, burning  and bioethanol (see ) when created from virgin material, is increasingly controversial and may or may not be considered sustainable because it inadvertently increases global poverty, the clearing of more land for new agriculture fields (the source of the biofuel is also the same source of food), and may use unsustainable growing methods (such as the use of environmentally harmful pesticides and fertilizers).\nDigestion of organic material to produce methane is becoming an increasingly popular method of biomass energy production. Materials such as waste sludge can be digested to release methane gas that can then be burnt to produce electricity. Methane gas is also a natural by-product of landfills, full of decomposing waste, and can be harnessed here to produce electricity as well. The advantage in burning methane gas is that is prevents the methane from being released into the atmosphere, exacerbating the . Although this method of biomass energy production is typically large scale (done in landfills), it can be done on a smaller individual or community scale as well.\nGlobally, food accounts for 48% and 70% of household environmental impacts on land and water resources respectively, with consumption of meat, dairy and processed food rising quickly with income.\n is highly resource and energy intensive.  Industrial agriculture systems typically require heavy , extensive  and , intensive , concentrated  production, and other continual inputs. As a result of these industrial farming conditions, today's mounting environmental stresses are further exacerbated. These stresses include: declining , chemical , chemical , , , loss in , and other ecological concerns.\n food distribution and long distance transport are additionally  and  exhaustive.  Substantial climate-disrupting , boosted by the transport of food over long distances, are of growing concern as the world faces such  as  depletion,  and . \u201cThe average American meal currently costs about 1500 miles, and takes about 10  of oil and other  to produce a single calorie of food.\u201d\nA more sustainable means of acquiring food is to purchase locally and seasonally. Buying food from local farmers reduces , caused by long-distance food transport, and stimulates the local economy. Local, small-scale farming operations also typically utilize more sustainable methods of agriculture than conventional industrial farming systems such as decreased tillage, , fostered biodiversity and reduced chemical pesticide and fertilizer applications. Adapting a more regional, seasonally based diet is more sustainable as it entails purchasing less energy and resource demanding produce that naturally grow within a local area and require no long-distance transport. These vegetables and fruits are also grown and harvested within their suitable . Thus,  farming does not require energy intensive  production, extensive irrigation, plastic packaging and long-distance transport from importing non-regional foods, and other environmental stressors. Local, seasonal produce is typically fresher, unprocessed and argued to be more nutritious. Local produce also contains less to no chemical residues from applications required for long-distance shipping and handling. , public events where local small-scale farmers gather and sell their produce, are a good source for obtaining local food and knowledge about local farming productions.  As well as promoting localization of food, farmers markets are a central gathering place for community interaction.  Another way to become involved in regional food distribution is by joining a local  (CSA). A CSA consists of a community of growers and consumers who pledge to support a farming operation while equally sharing the risks and benefits of food production. CSA's usually involve a system of weekly pick-ups of locally farmed vegetables and fruits, sometimes including dairy products, meat and special food items such as baked goods. Considering the previously noted rising environmental crisis, the United States and much of the world is facing immense vulnerability to famine. Local food production ensures food security if potential transportation disruptions and climatic, economical, and sociopolitical disasters were to occur.\n also involves high  such as ,  and  of , especially pertaining to water and food. Mass meat production increase the amount of .  For more information on the  and consumption, see the . Reducing , perhaps to a few meals a week, or adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet, alleviates the demand for environmentally damaging industrial meat production. Buying and consuming organically raised,  or  is another alternative towards more sustainable meat consumption.\nPurchasing and supporting organic products is another fundamental contribution to sustainable living.  is a rapidly emerging trend in the food industry and in the web of sustainability. According to the   (NOSB),  is defined as \"an ecological production management system that promotes and enhances biodiversity, biological cycles, and soil biological activity. It is based on minimal use of off-farm inputs and on management practices that restore, maintain, or enhance ecological harmony. The primary goal of organic agriculture is to optimize the health and productivity of interdependent communities of soil life, plants, animals and people.\" Upon sustaining these goals, organic agriculture uses techniques such as , , ,  and . In addition, organic farming prohibits or strictly limits the use of manufactured fertilizers and pesticides,  such as , livestock ,  and . Organically farmed products include vegetables, fruit, grains, herbs, meat, dairy, eggs, fibers, and flowers. See  for more information.\nIn addition to local, small-scale farms, there has been a recent emergence in  expanding from  to private . With this trend, both farmers and ordinary people are becoming involved in . A network of urban farming systems helps to further ensure regional food security and encourages self-sufficiency and cooperative interdependence within communities. With every bite of food raised from urban gardens, negative environmental impacts are reduced in numerous ways. For instance, vegetables and fruits raised within small-scale gardens and farms are not grown with tremendous applications of  required for industrial agricultural operations. The nitrogen fertilizers cause toxic chemical leaching and runoff that enters our water tables. Nitrogen fertilizer also produces , a more damaging  than . Local, community-grown food also requires no imported, long-distance transport which further depletes our  reserves. In developing more efficiency per land acre, urban gardens can be started in a wide variety of areas: in vacant lots, public parks, private yards, church and school yards, on roof tops (), and many other places.  Communities can work together in changing zoning limitations in order for public and private gardens to be permissible. Aesthetically pleasing  plants can also be incorporated into city landscaping such as blueberry bushes, grapevines trained on an arbor, pecan trees, etc. With as small a scale as home or community farming, sustainable and organic farming methods can easily be utilized. Such sustainable, organic farming techniques include: , , , , ,  and . For more information on sustainable farming systems, see .\nPreserving and storing foods reduces reliance on long-distance transported food and the market industry. Home-grown foods can be preserved and stored outside of their growing season and continually consumed throughout the year, enhancing self-sufficiency and independence from the supermarket. Food can be preserved and saved by , , , , ,  and jellying. For more information, see .\nWith rising  concerns,  exacerbated by  and high energy prices, the conventional  is becoming less and less feasible to the conversation of sustainability. Revisions of  systems that foster mobility, low-cost transportation and healthier urban environments are needed. Such urban transport systems should consist of a combination of , ,  pathways and  . Public transport systems such as underground rail systems and bus transit systems shift huge numbers of people away from reliance on car  and dramatically reduce the rate of carbon emissions caused by automobile transport.  is another alternative for reducing oil consumption and carbon emissions by transit.\nIn comparison to automobiles, bicycles are a paragon of energy efficient personal transportation with the bicycle roughly 50 times more energy efficient than driving. Bicycles increase mobility while alleviating , lowering  and , and increasing . Most importantly, they do not emit climate-disturbing .  programs are beginning to boom throughout the world and are modeled in leading cities such as ,  and . Bike-sharing programs offer  and docking stations that supply hundreds to thousands of bikes for rental throughout a city through small deposits or affordable memberships.\nA recent boom has occurred in  especially in China and other Asian countries. Electric bikes are similar to  vehicles in that they are battery powered and can be plugged into the provincial  for recharging as needed. In contrast to plug-in hybrid cars, electric bikes do not directly use any .  Adequate sustainable urban transportation is dependent upon proper city  and planning that incorporates efficient public transit along with bicycle and pedestrian-friendly pathways.  Patrick Maria Johnson was the founder of this.\nA major factor of sustainable living involves that which no human can live without, . Unsustainable water use has far reaching implications for humankind.  Currently, humans use one-fourth of the Earth's total fresh water in natural circulation, and over half the accessible . Additionally,  and water demand is ever increasing. Thus, it is necessary to use available water more efficiently. In sustainable living, one can use water more sustainably through a series of simple, everyday measures.  These measures involve considering indoor  efficiency, outdoor water use, and daily water use awareness.\nHousing and  account for 12 percent of America's freshwater withdrawals.  A typical American single family home uses about 70 US gallons (260\u00a0L) per person per day indoors. This use can be reduced by simple alterations in behavior and upgrades to  quality.\n accounted for almost 30% of residential indoor  in the United States in 1999. One flush of a standard U.S. toilet requires more water than most individuals, and many families, in the world use for all their needs in an entire day.\nA home's toilet water sustainability can be improved in one of two ways: improving the current toilet or installing a more efficient toilet.  To improve the current toilet, one possible method is to put weighted plastic bottles in the toilet tank.  Also, there are inexpensive tank banks or float booster available for purchase.  A tank bank is a plastic bag to be filled with water and hung in the toilet tank. A  attaches underneath the float ball of pre-1986 three and a half gallon capacity toilets.  It allows these toilets to operate at the same valve and float setting but significantly reduces their water level, saving between one and one and a third gallons of water per flush.  A major waste of water in existing toilets is leaks.  A slow toilet leak is undetectable to the eye, but can waste hundreds of gallons each month.  One way to check this is to put food dye in the tank, and to see if the water in the toilet bowl turns the same color.  In the event of a leaky flapper, one can replace it with an adjustable toilet flapper, which allows self-adjustment of the amount of water per flush.\nIn installing a new toilet there are a number of options to obtain the most water efficient model. A  uses one to two gallons per flush.  Traditionally, toilets use three to five gallons per flush. If an eighteen-liter per flush toilet is removed and a six-liter per flush toilet is put in its place, 70% of the water flushed will be saved while the overall indoor water use by will be reduced by 30%. It is possible to have a toilet that uses no water.  A  treats human waste through  and , producing a valuable soil additive.  These toilets feature a two-compartment bowl to separate urine from feces.  The urine can be collected or sold as fertilizer.  The feces can be dried and bagged or composted.  These toilets cost scarcely more than regularly installed toilets and do not require a sewer hookup.  In addition to providing valuable fertilizer, these toilets are highly sustainable because they save sewage collection and treatment, as well as lessen agricultural costs and improve .\nAdditionally, one can reduce toilet water sustainability by limiting total toilet flushing. For instance, instead of flushing small wastes, such as tissues, one can dispose of these items in the trash or compost.\nOn average,  were 18% of U.S. indoor water use in 1999, at 6\u20138 US gallons (23\u201330\u00a0L) per minute traditionally in America. A simple method to reduce this use is to switch to low-flow, high-performance showerheads.  These showerheads use only 1.0-1.5 gpm or less. An alternative to replacing the showerhead is to install a converter. This device arrests a running shower upon reaching the desired temperature.  can be used to obtain optimal water temperature, and are more sustainable because they reduce dependence on fossil fuels. To lessen excess water use, water pipes can be insulated with pre-slit foam pipe insulation. This insulation decreases hot water generation time. A simple, straightforward method to conserve water when showering is to take shorter showers. One method to accomplish this is to turn off the water when it is not necessary (such as while lathering) and resuming the shower when water is necessary.  This can be facilitated when the plumbing or showerhead allow turning off the water without disrupting the desired temperature setting (common in the UK but not the United States).\nOn average, sinks were 15% of U.S. indoor water use in 1999. There are, however, easy methods to rectify excessive water loss. Available for purchase is a screw-on aerator. This device works by combining water with air thus generating a frothy substance with greater perceived volume, reducing water use by half. Additionally, there is a flip-valve available that allows flow to be turned off and back on at the previously reached temperature. Finally, a  device creates a 1.5-2.4 gpm stream of water that reduces water use by half, but can be turned to normal water level when optimal.\nIn addition to buying the above devices, one can live more sustainably by checking sinks for leaks, and fixing these links if they exist. According to the EPA, \"A small drip from a worn faucet washer can waste 20 gallons of water per day, while larger leaks can waste hundreds of gallons\". When washing dishes by hand, it is not necessary to leave the water running for rinsing, and it is more efficient to rinse dishes simultaneously.\nOn average, dishwashing consumes 1% of indoor water use. When using a , water can be conserved by only running the machine when it is full.  Some have a \"low flow\" setting to use less water per wash cycle. Enzymatic  clean dishes more efficiently and more successfully with a smaller amount of water at a lower temperature.\nOn average, 23% of U.S. indoor water use in 1999 was due to clothes washing. In contrast to other machines, American  have changed little to become more sustainable. A typical washing machine has a vertical-axis design, in which clothes are agitated in a tubful of water. Horizontal-axis machines, in contrast, put less water into the bottom of the rub and rotate clothes through it. These machines are more efficient in terms of soap use and clothing stability.\nThere are a number of ways one can incorporate a personal , , and  in more sustainable living. While conserving water is a major element of sustainability, so is sequestering water.\nIn planning a yard and garden space, it is most sustainable to consider the plants, soil, and available water.  Drought resistant shrubs, plants, and grasses require a smaller amount of water in comparison to more traditional species.  Additionally, native plants (as opposed to herbaceous perennials) will use a smaller supply of water and have a heightened resistance to plant diseases of the area.  is a technique that selects drought-tolerant plants and accounts for endemic features such as , , and  range.  It can reduce landscape water use by 50 \u2013 70%, while providing  space for wildlife.  Plants on slopes help reduce  by slowing and absorbing accumulated rainfall.  Grouping plants by watering needs further reduces water waste.\nAfter planting, placing a circumference of  surrounding plants functions to lessen .  To do this, firmly press two to four inches of organic matter along the plant's dripline. This prevents . When watering, consider the range of sprinklers; watering paved areas is unnecessary.  Additionally, to conserve the maximum amount of water, watering should be carried out during early mornings on non-windy days to reduce water loss to evaporation.  Drip-irrigation systems and soaker hoses are a more sustainable alternative to the traditional sprinkler system.  Drip-irrigation systems employ small gaps at standard distances in a hose, leading to the slow trickle of water droplets which percolate the soil over a protracted period.  These systems use 30 \u2013 50% less water than conventional methods. Soaker hoses help to reduce water use by up to 90%.  They connect to a garden hose and lay along the row of plants under a layer of mulch.  A layer of  added to the soil helps to increase its absorption and water retention; previously planted areas can be covered with .\nIn caring for a lawn, there are a number of measures that can increase the sustainability of lawn maintenance techniques.  A primary aspect of lawn care is watering.  To conserve water, it is important to only water when necessary, and to deep soak when watering.  Additionally, a lawn may be left to go dormant, renewing after a dry spell to its original vitality.\nA common method of water sequestrations is , which incorporates the collection and storage of rain.  Primarily, the rain is obtained from a roof, and stored on the ground in catchment tanks.  Water sequestration varies based on extent, cost, and complexity. A simple method involves a single barrel at the bottom of a downspout, while a more complex method involves multiple tanks.  It is highly sustainable to use stored water in place of purified water for activities such as irrigation and flushing toilets.  Additionally, using stored rainwater reduces the amount of runoff , picked up from roofs and pavements that would normally enter streams through storm drains.  The following equation can be used to estimate annual water supply:\nCollection area (square feet) \u00d7 Rainfall (inch/year) / 12 (inch/foot) = Cubic Feet of Water/Year\nCubic Feet/Year \u00d7 7.43 (Gallons/Cubic Foot) = Gallons/year\nNote, however, this calculation does not account for losses such as evaporation or leakage.\n systems function in sequestering used indoor water, such as laundry, bath and sink water, and filtering it for reuse.  Greywater can be reused in  and toilet flushing.  There are two types of greywater systems: gravity fed manual systems and package systems.  The manual systems do not require electricity but may require a larger yard space.  The package systems require electricity but are self-contained and can be installed indoors.\nAs populations and resource demands climb, waste production contributes to  of , leaching of  into the  and waterways, and .  In America alone, over the course of a decade, 500\u00a0trillion pounds (230\u00a0Gt) of American resources will have been transformed into nonproductive wastes and gases. Thus, a crucial component of sustainable living is being waste conscious.  One can do this by reducing waste,  commodities, and recycling.\nThere are a number of ways to  in sustainable living.  Two methods to reduce paper waste are canceling  like credit card and insurance offers and direct  and changing monthly paper statements to paperless emails.  Junk mail alone accounted for 1.72 million tons of  in 2009. Another method to reduce waste is to buy in bulk, reducing . Preventing  can limit the amount of organic waste sent to landfills producing the powerful greenhouse gas methane. Another example of waste reduction involves being cognizant of purchasing excessive amounts when buying materials with limited use like cans of paint. Non-hazardous or less hazardous alternatives can also limit the toxicity of waste.\nBy reusing materials, one lives more sustainably by not contributing to the addition of waste to landfills. Reusing saves  by decreasing the necessity of  extraction. For example, reusable bags can reduce the amount of waste created by grocery shopping eliminating the need to create and ship plastic bags and the need to manage their disposal and recycling or polluting effects.\n, a process that breaks down used items into raw materials to make new materials, is a particularly useful means of contributing to the renewal of goods.  Recycling incorporates three primary processes; collection and processing, manufacturing, and purchasing recycled products.  A natural example of recycling involves using food waste as compost to enrich the quality of soil, which can be carried out at home or locally with community . An offshoot of recycling, , strives to convert material into something of similar or greater value in its second life. By integrating measures of reusing, reducing, and recycling one can effectively reduce personal waste and use materials in a more sustainable manner.\n"},
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_tourism", "title": "SustainabletourismWikipedia", "body": " is the concept of visiting somewhere  as a  and trying to make a positive , society, and economy. Tourism can involve primary  to the general location, local transportation, accommodations, entertainment, recreation, nourishment and shopping. It can be related to  for leisure, business and what is called VFR (visiting friends and relatives). There is now broad consensus that tourism development should be sustainable; however, the question of how to achieve this remains an object of debate.\nWithout travel there is no , so the concept of  tourism is tightly linked to a concept of . Two relevant considerations are tourism's reliance on fossil fuels and tourism's effect on climate change. 72 percent of tourism's CO emissions come from transportation, 24 percent from accommodations, and 4 percent from local activities.  accounts for 55% of those transportation CO emissions (or 40% of tourism's total). However, when considering the impact of all greenhouse gas emissions, of condensation trails and induced cirrus clouds, aviation alone could account for up to 75% of tourism's climate impact.\nThe  (IATA) considers an annual increase in aviation  of 2 percent per year through 2050 to be realistic. However, both Airbus and Boeing expect the passenger-kilometers of air transport to increase by about 5 percent yearly through at least 2020, overwhelming any efficiency gains. By 2050, with other economic sectors having greatly reduced their , tourism is likely to be generating 40 percent of global carbon emissions. The main cause is an increase in the average distance travelled by tourists, which for many years has been increasing at a faster rate than the number of trips taken. \"Sustainable transportation is now established as the critical issue confronting a global tourism industry that is palpably unsustainable, and aviation lies at the heart of this issue.\"\nGlobal economists forecast continuing international  growth, the amount depending on the location.  As one of the world's largest and fastest growing industries, this continuous growth will place great stress on remaining biologically diverse  and  cultures, which are often used to support .  Tourists who promote sustainable tourism are sensitive to these dangers and seek to protect tourist destinations, and to protect tourism as an industry. Sustainable tourists can reduce the impact of tourism in many ways:\nIncreasingly, destinations and tourism operations are endorsing and following \"responsible tourism\" as a pathway towards sustainable tourism. Responsible tourism and sustainable tourism have an identical goal, that of .  The pillars of responsible tourism are therefore the same as those of sustainable tourism \u2013 environmental integrity, social justice and economic development.  The major difference between the two is that, in responsible tourism, individuals, organizations and businesses are asked to take responsibility for their actions and the impacts of their actions.  This shift in emphasis has taken place because some stakeholders feel that insufficient progress towards realizing sustainable tourism has been made since the  in Rio.  This is partly because everyone has been expecting others to behave in a sustainable manner. The emphasis on responsibility in responsible tourism means that everyone involved in tourism \u2013 government, product owners and operators, transport operators, community services,  and  (CBOs), tourists, local communities, industry associations \u2013 are responsible for achieving the goals of responsible tourism.\nStakeholders of sustainable tourism play a role in continuing this form of tourism. This can include organizations as well as individuals, to be specific, ECOFIN.  \"A stakeholder in the tourism industry is deemed to be anyone who is impacted on by development positively or negatively, and as a result it reduces potential conflict between the tourists and host community by involving the latter in shaping the way in which tourism develops.\nThe  (GSTC) serves as the international body for fostering increased knowledge and understanding of sustainable tourism practices, promoting the adoption of universal sustainable tourism principles and building demand for sustainable travel. It has a number of programmes including the setting of international standards for accreditation agencies (the organisations that would inspect a tourism product, and certify them as a sustainable company).\nThe values and ulterior motives of governments often need to be taken into account when assessing the motives for sustainable tourism. One important factor to consider in any ecologically sensitive or remote area or an area new to tourism is that of . This is the capacity of tourists of visitors an area can sustainably tolerate without damaging the environment or culture of the surrounding area. This can be altered and revised in time and with changing perceptions and values. For example, originally the sustainable carrying capacity of the  was set at 12,000 visitors per annum but was later changed by the Ecuadorian government to 50,000 for economic reasons and objectives.\n are one of the stakeholders in advocating sustainable tourism. Their roles can range from spearheading sustainable tourism practices to simply doing research. University research teams and scientists can be tapped to aid in the process of planning. Such solicitation of research can be observed in the planning of  in .\nDive resort operators in , , play a crucial role by developing exclusive zones for  and  respectively, such that both tourists and locals can benefit from the venture.\nLarge ,  and other major organized events drive the travel, tourism and hospitality industry. Cities and  compete to attract such commerce, commerce which has heavy impacts on resource use and the environment. Major sporting events, such as the , present special problems regarding environmental burdens and degradation. But burdens imposed by the regular convention industry can be vastly more significant.\nGreen conventions and events are a new but growing sector and marketing point within the convention and hospitality industry. More environmentally aware organizations, corporations and government agencies are now seeking more sustainable event practices, greener hotels, restaurants and convention venues, and more energy efficient or climate neutral travel and ground transportation. However, the convention trip not taken can be the most sustainable option: \"With most international conferences having hundreds if not thousands of participants, and the bulk of these usually traveling by plane, conference travel is an area where significant reductions in air-travel-related GHG emissions could be made. ... This does not mean non-attendance\" (Reay, 2004), since modern Internet communications are now ubiquitous and remote audio/visual participation. For example, by 2003  had already successfully hosted several international conferences. A particular example is the large American Geophysical Union's annual meeting, which has used livestreaming for several years. This provides live streams and recordings of keynotes, named lectures and oral sessions, and provides opportunities to submit questions and interact with authors and peers. Following the live-stream, the recording of each session is posted on-line within 24 hours.\nSome convention centers have begun to take direct action in reducing the impact of the conventions they host. One example is the  in , which has a very aggressive  program, a large  system, and other programs aimed at reducing impact and increasing efficiency.\nLocal communities benefit from sustainable tourism through economic development, job creation, and infrastructure development. Tourism revenues bring economic growth and prosperity to attractive tourist destinations which can raise the standard of living in destination communities.  Sustainable tourism operators commit themselves to creating jobs for local community members. Increase in tourism revenue to an area acts as a driver for the development of increased infrastructure. As tourist demands increase in a destination, a more robust infrastructure is needed to support the needs of both the tourism industry and the local community. A 2009 study of rural operators throughout the province of British Columbia, Canada found \"an overall strong 'pro-sustainability' attitude among respondents. Dominant barriers identified were lack of available money to invest, lack of incentive programs, other business priorities, and limited access to suppliers of sustainable products, with the most common recommendation being the need for incentive programs to encourage businesses to become more sustainable.\"\nThe renewed emphasis on outward-orientated growth which accompanied the rise in  development strategies in the 1990s in the south also focused attention on international tourism as an import potential growth sector for many countries, particularly in Less Economically Developed Countries () as many of the world's most beautiful and 'untouched' places are located in the .\nPrior to the 1960s studies tended to assume that the extension of the tourism industry to LEDCs was a good thing. In the 1970s this changed as academics started to take a much more negative view on tourism's consequences, particularly criticising the industry as an effective contributor towards development. International tourism is a volatile industry with visitors quick to abandon destinations that were formerly popular because of threats to health or security.\nOne common issue with tourism in a place where there was none prior to First World companies arriving is that of the displacement and resettlement of local communities. The  tribes in Tanzania have been a victim of this problem. After the second World War First World conservationists with the intent of making such areas accessible to tourists as well as preserving the areas natural beauty and ecology moved into the areas where the Maasai tribes lived. This was often achieved through the setting up of national parks and conservation areas (Monbiot 1994; Olerokonga, 1992:7).\nIt has been claimed that Maasai activities did not threaten the wildlife and the First World knowledge was blurred by ' disdain' and misunderstandings of savannah wildlife. As the Maasai have been displaced the area within the  (NCA) has been modified to allow easier access for tourists by actions such as building campsites, tracks and the removal of stone objects such as stones for souvenirs.\nThis kind of 'sustainable tourism' is viewed by many as an oxymoron or metaphor since it seriously can't change anything. There likely is no way to make tourism sustainable but if all tourists cooperate it could possibly work in a viable world. It is a reality that many things done in the name of sustainability are actually masking the desire to allow extra profits. There is often alienation of local populations from the tourists.\n\"The environmental  focuses on the overall viability and .  degradation, , and  are detrimental because they increase vulnerability, undermine system health, and reduce . This aspect of sustainability has been the most often discussed through the literature by numerous authors such as Hall, C. M. & Lew A.A. (1998), Hall, D. (2000), Weaver (2006), and many others.\"\nMany  areas are experiencing particular pressure from growth in lifestyles and growing numbers of tourists.  are limited in extent consisting of only a narrow strip along the edge of the . Coastal areas are often the first environments to experience the detrimental impacts of tourism. A detailed study of the impact on coastal areas, with reference to western India can be an example.\nThe inevitable change is on the horizon as holiday destinations put more effort into sustainable tourism.  and management controls can reduce the impact on coastal environments and ensure that investment into tourism products supports sustainable coastal tourism.\nSome studies have led to interesting conceptual models applicable for coastal tourism. The 'inverted funnel model' and the 'embedded model' (Jacob, S. 2008) can be metaphors for understanding the interplay of different stake-holders like government, local community, tourists and business community in developing tourist destinations.\n attracts many tourist climbers wanting to summit the peak of the highest mountain in the world each year. Everest is a  site. Over the years, carelessness and excessive consumption of resources by mountaineers, as well as  by livestock, have damaged the habitats of , , , and scores of bird species. To counteract past abuses, various  programs have been carried out by local communities and the Nepalese government.\nExpeditions have removed supplies and equipment left by climbers on Everest\u2019s slopes, including hundreds of oxygen containers. A large quantity of the  of past climbers\u2014tons of items such as tents, cans, crampons, and human waste\u2014has been hauled down from the mountain and recycled or discarded. However, the bodies of most of the more than 260 climbers who have died on Everest (notably on its upper slopes) have not been removed, as they are unreachable or\u2014for those that are accessible\u2014their weight makes carrying them down extremely difficult. Notable in the cleanup endeavour have been the efforts of the Eco Everest Expeditions, the first of which was organized in 2008 to commemorate the death that January of Everest-climbing pioneer Sir Edmund Hillary. Those expeditions also have publicized ecological issues (in particular, concerns about the effects of climate change in the region through observations that the Khumbu Icefall has been melting).\nSmall Islands are especially affected and often depend on tourism, as this industry makes up anywhere from 40% to 75% of the GDP () for various islands including , , , and .\nMass tourism tends to put a strain on fragile island ecosystems and the natural resources it provides. Studies have shown that early practices of tourism were unsustainable and took a toll to environmental factors, hurting the natural landscapes that originally drew in the tourists. For example, in Barbados, beaches are the main attraction and have been eroded and destroyed over the years. This is due to inefficient political decisions and policies along with irresponsible tourist activity, such as reckless diving and waste disposal, damaging coastal and marine environments. Such practices also altered physical features of the landscape and caused a loss in , leading to the disruption of ecosystems. Many other islands faced environmental damage such as Isle of Man and .\nHowever, visitors are attracted to the less industrial scene of these islands, and according to a survey by Canavan, over 80% of the people enjoyed the natural landscape when they visited, many commenting that they wanted to protect and save the wildlife in the area. Many tourists have turned to practices of sustainable and eco tourism in attempt to save the nature they enjoy in these locations, while some political entities try to enforce this in attempt to keep tourism in their island afloat.\nThird World countries are especially interested in international tourism, and many believe it brings countries a large selection of economic benefits including employment opportunities, small business development, and increased in payments of foreign exchange. Many assume that more money is gained through developing luxury goods and services in spite of the fact that this increases a countries dependency on imported products, foreign investments and expatriate skills. This classic 'trickle down' financial strategy rarely makes its way down to brings its benefits down to small businesses.\nIt has been said that the economic benefits of large-scale tourism are not doubted but that the backpacker or budget traveller sector is often neglected as a potential growth sector by Third World governments. This sector brings significant non-economic benefits which could help to empower and educate the communities involved in this sector. \"Aiming 'low' builds upon the skills of the local population, promotes self-reliance, and develops the confidence of community members in dealing with outsiders, all signs of empowerment\" and all of which aid in the overall development of a nation.\nThere has been the promotion of sustainable tourism practices surrounding the management of tourist locations by locals or the community. This form of tourism is based on the premise that the people living next to a resource are the ones best suited to protecting it. This means that the tourism activities and businesses are developed and operated by local community members, and certainly with their consent and support. Sustainable tourism typically involves the conservation of resources that are capitalized upon for tourism purposes. Locals run the businesses and are responsible for promoting the conservation messages to protect their environment.\nCommunity-based sustainable tourism (CBST) associates the success of the sustainability of the ecotourism location to the management practices of the communities who are directly or indirectly dependent on the location for their livelihoods. A salient feature of CBST is that local knowledge is usually utilised alongside wide general frameworks of ecotourism business models. This allows the participation of locals at the management level and typically allows a more intimate understanding of the environment.\nThe use of local knowledge also means an easier entry level into a tourism industry for locals whose jobs or livelihoods are affected by the use of their environment as tourism locations. Environmentally sustainable development crucially depends on the presence of local support for a project. It has also been noted that in order for success projects must provide direct benefits for the local community.\nHowever, recent research has found that economic linkages generated by CBST may only be sporadic, and that the linkages with agriculture are negatively affected by seasonality and by the small scale of the cultivated areas. This means that CBST may only have small-scale positive effects for these communities.\nIt has also been said that partnerships between governments and tourism agencies with smaller communities is not particularly effective because of the disparity in aims between the two groups, i.e. true sustainability versus mass tourism for maximum profit. In Honduras such a divergence can be demonstrated where consultants from the World Bank and officials from the Institute of tourism wanted to set up a selection of 5-star hotels near various  destinations. But another operating approach in the region by USAID and APROECOH (an ecotourism association) promotes community-based efforts which has trained many local Hondurans. Mader concluded that the grassroot organisations were more successful in Honduras.\nThere has been some discussion regarding the told of inter-governmental organisations and the development of sustainable tourism practices in the third world. In Mowforth and Munt's book 'Tourism and Sustainability: New Tourism in the Third World, they criticised a document that was written by the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC), the World Tourism Organisation and the Earth Council, which was included in Agenda 21. It was entitled 'Agenda 21 for the Travel and Tourism Industry: Towards Environmentally Sustainable Development'. Mowforth and Munt commented on the language used to describe the environment and local culture in such documents because the preservation of the environment and local culture are the two main objectives when practising sustainable tourism. They pointed out that some of the key words used were 'core asset', 'core product', 'product quality' and 'preserve'. They argued that the treatment of the environment as a marketable product was clear and that such documents provide a good list of advice for Third World governments regarding sustainable tourism but do not actually provide the resources to incorporate them into the development of their tourism industries.\nIt is arguments such as these that postulate that there is a gap between the advice given by non-governmental or inter-governmental organisations to Third World governments and what can actually be brought to realisation. These arguments try and persuade readers that documents like the one released by the WTTC that the development of sustainable tourism actually 'bypasses the interests of local people'.\nThere are many definitions and understandings of responsible tourism. According to the Center for Responsible Tourism, responsible tourism can be defined as, \"tourism that maximizes the benefits to local communities, minimizes negative social or environmental impacts, and helps local people conserve fragile cultures and habitats or species.\" Responsible tourism incorporates not only responsibility with the physical environment, but also an incorporation of awareness for the economic and social interactions whereas, sustainable tourism focuses more on the environmental impacts. Responsible tourism is regarded as a behaviour. It is more than a form of tourism as it represents an approach to engaging with tourism, be that as a tourist, a business, locals at a destination or any other tourism stakeholder. It emphasizes that all stakeholders are responsible for the kind of tourism they develop or engage in. This ensures that the tourism service providers and purchasers or consumers are held accountable. Whilst different groups will see responsibility in different ways, the shared understanding is that responsible tourism should entail an improvement in tourism. Tourism should become \u2018better\u2019 as a result of the responsible tourism approach\nWithin the notion of betterment resides the acknowledgement that conflicting interests need to be balanced. However, the objective is to create better places for people to live in and to visit. Importantly, there is no blueprint for responsible tourism: what is deemed responsible may differ depending on places and cultures. Responsible Tourism is an aspiration that can be realized in different ways in different originating markets and in the diverse destinations of the world (Goodwin, 2016).\nThe concept of responsible tourism emerged following the environmental awareness that rose out of the 1960s and 70s amidst a growing phenomenon of \u201cmass tourism\u201d. The European Travel Commission in 1973 and a multilateral initiative to instate environmentally sound tourism and development was advanced. The United Nations specialized agency called the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), highlights the link between tourism and development in aims of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Given the dramatic increase in tourism, the report strongly promotes responsible tourism. Given the local based approach of Responsible Tourism, it can also incorporate local populations into the decision making and tourism planning process. While further research is needed to understand the impacts of responsible tourism, a study conducted in 2017 found that well-managed responsible tourism practices were beneficial to local communities.\nFocusing in particular on businesses, according to the Cape Town Declaration on Responsible Tourism, it will have the following characteristics:\nWhile widely acclaimed, responsible tourism has also been critiqued. Studies have shown that the degree to which individuals engage in responsible tourism is contingent upon their engagement socially. Meaning, tourist behaviors will fluctuate depending on the range of social engagement that each tourist chooses take part in. A study regarding responsible tourists behavior concludes that it is not only a personal behavior of tourists that shape outcomes, but also a reflection of mechanisms put in place by governments. Other research has put into question the promise that tourism even responsible tourism is inline with UN Sustainable Development Goals given the difficulties in measuring such impact. Some argue that actually detracts attention from the wider issues surrounding tourism that are in need of regulation, such as number of visitors and environmental impact.\nHumane tourism is part of the movement of . The idea is to empower local communities through travel related businesses around the world, first and foremost in . The idea of humane travel or humane  is to connect travelers from , ,  and  seeking new adventures and authentic experiences directly, to local businesses in the specific locations they wish to visit \u2013 thus, giving economic advantages to local businesses and giving travelers authentic and truly unique travel experiences. Humane travel or humane tourism focuses on the people, the local community. The idea is to enable travelers to experience the world through the eyes of its local people while contributing directly to those people, ensuring that tourist dollars benefit the local community directly.\nHumane tourism is about giving opportunity to the local people, empower them, enable them to enjoy the fruits of tourism directly. The  is changing tourism. More and more travelers are planning their travels and vacations via the net. The Internet enables people to cut off commissions. The traveler can search for new destinations to visit, talk or read about other people experience, and buy the services directly. The Internet platform can encourage local people to start new businesses and that already existing small businesses will begin to promote themselves through the net and receive the economic advantages of this directly in their communities. The world is now in a new tourism age, with globalization and the Internet playing a key role.\nThe new travelers have traveled the world, they have seen the classic sites. Staying at a Western hotel is not attractive enough, and they are excited by the prospect of experiencing the authentic local way of life: to go fishing with a local fisherman, to eat the fish with his family, to sleep in a typical village house. These tourists or travelers, are happy to know that while doing so they promote the economic well-being of those same people they spend time with.\nHumane tourism is part of Responsible tourism. The concept of Responsible Tourism originated in the work of Jost Krippendorf in The Holiday Makers called for \u201crebellious tourists and rebellious locals\u201d to create new forms of tourism. His vision was \u201cto develop and promote new forms of tourism, which will bring the greatest possible benefit to all the participants \u2013 travelers, the host population and the tourist business, without causing intolerable ecological and social damage.\u201d As one can see he already talked, back in the 80s about benefits for the host population and used the term human tourism. Humane travel focuses on that host local population.\nThe  national tourism policy (1996) used the term \"responsible tourism\" and mentioned the well-being of the local community as a main factor.\nThe  Declaration on Responsible Tourism in Destinations, agreed in 2002, that Responsible Tourism is about \u201cmaking better places for people to live in and better places for people to visit.\u201d The declaration focused on \"places\" but did mention the local population.\nFrom the  summit or earth summit on 1992 until the  Commission on Sustainable Development in 1999, the main focus of the tourism industry was the earth, the planet, the places, \"green\" or \"eco\" tourism. Now there is a trend to include the local population. This trend or branch of responsible tourism is called humane tourism or humane travel.\nAs with the view of responsible tourism, responsible hospitality is essentially about creating better places for people to live in, and better places for people to visit.  This does not mean all forms of hospitality are also forms of tourism although hospitality is the largest sector of the tourism industry. As such we should not be surprised at overlaps between responsible hospitality and responsible tourism.  In the instance where place of permanent residence is also the place where the hospitality service is consumed, if for example a meal is consumed in a local restaurant, this does not obviate the requirement to improve the place of residence. As such, the essence of Responsible Hospitality is not contingent upon touristic forms of hospitality.\nWhile Friedman (1962)  famously argued that, admittedly within legal parameters, the sole responsibility of business was to generate profit for shareholders the idea that businesses\u2019 responsibility extends beyond this has existed for decades and is most frequently encountered in the concept of . There are numerous ways businesses can and do engage in activities that are not intended to benefit shareholders and management, at least not in the short term. However, often acts of corporate social responsibility are undertaken because of the perceived benefit to business. Usually in hospitality this relates to the cost reductions associated with improved energy efficiency  but may also relate to, for example, the rise in  and the view that being seen to be a responsible business is beneficial to revenue growth.\nAs per the Cape Town Declaration on Responsible Tourism, responsible hospitality is culturally sensitive. Instead of then calling for the unachievable, responsible hospitality simply makes the case for more responsible forms of hospitality, hospitality that benefits locals first, and visitors second. Certainly, all forms of hospitality can be improved and managed so that negative impacts are minimized whilst striving for a maximization of positive impacts on the environment.\nMinistry of Tourism, Government of India has mentioned that some of the hospitality management/ culinary training institutes in India will no longer make it mandatory for students to engage in non-vegetarian cooking. The student will be given an option to choose vegetarian cooking. IHMCTAN Ahmedabad, IHMCTAN Bhopal and IHMCTAN Jaipur are the hospitality training institutes that offer a vegetarian choice, and this practice will be extended to all IHMCTANs.\nFundamental research was presented in the book \u00abSustainable tourism development: theory, methodology, business realities\u00bb (: )) by Ukrainian scientist Professor Tetiana Tkachenko in 2006 \u0443ear (with corrections and additions in 2009). The results are used to prepare students in , specialties: tourism, hotel and restaurant business, tourism management, management of hotel and restaurant business, international tourism business and international hotel business.\n"},
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_procurement", "title": "SustainableprocurementWikipedia", "body": "\n is the process of finding, acquiring, buying goods, services or works from an external source, often via a  or competitive  process. The process is used to ensure the buyer receives goods, services or works the best possible price, when aspects such as quality, quantity, time, and location are compared. Procurement is considered sustainable when organizations broadens this framework by meeting their needs for goods, services, works, and utilities in a way that achieves value for money and promotes positive outcomes not only for the organization itself but for the economy, environment, and society. This framework is also known as the .\n is a spending and investment process typically associated with , although it is equally applicable to the . Organizations practicing sustainable procurement meet their needs for goods, services, utilities and works not on a private , but with a view to maximizing net benefits for themselves and the wider world. In doing so they must incorporate extrinsic cost considerations into decisions alongside the conventional  criteria of price and quality, although in practice the sustainable impacts of a potential supplier's approach are often assessed as a form of quality consideration. These considerations are typically divided thus: environmental, economic and social. To procure in a sustainable way involves looking beyond short-term needs and considering the longer term impacts of each purchase. Sustainable procurement is used to ensure that purchasing reflects broader goals linked to resource efficiency, climate change, social responsibility and economic resilience, for example.\nSustainable procurement involves a higher degree of collaboration and engagement between all parties in a supply chain.  Many businesses have adopted a broad interpretation of sustainable procurement and have developed tools and techniques to support this engagement and collaboration.\n \u2013 the letting of contracts for goods, works and services on the best possible terms \u2013 has historically been based on two criteria, price and quality, with a view to maximizing benefits for the procuring organization. Sustainable procurement broadens this framework to take account of third-party consequences of procurement decisions, forming a \"\" of external concerns which the procuring organization must fulfill.\nEnvironmental concerns are the dominant macro-level justification for sustainable procurement, born out of the growing 21st century consensus that humanity is placing excessive demands on available resources through unsustainable but well-established consumption patterns. Sustainable procurement aims to promote conservation, reuse and responsible management of these resources, using renewable or recycled materials where possible and reducing waste.\nThis is a sufficiently influential issue that environment-centric procurement (green procurement) is sometimes seen to stand alone from sustainable procurement. The most straightforward justification for green procurement is as a tool with which to address , but it offers the broader capacity to mitigate  of any and all scarce resources. Green procurement introduces into the procurement process a comparison between alternatives based on the criterion of their environmental impact. This comparison is extended to all stages of the procurement process, from the design stage, to the tender evaluation and realization stages.\nExamples of green procurement range from the purchase of energy-saving light-bulbs to the commissioning of a new building from renewable sourced timber via  being served in a workplace canteen. The ultimate green procurement is the avoidance of the purchase altogether.\nIn support of  the organization should develop and publish a 'Sustainable Development Procurement Guidelines and Procedures'. When it comes to purchasing products or services, referral to these guidelines would help make the organization become a leader in environmentally responsible purchasing.\nAlthough various corporate giants have publicly acknowledged adopting sustainable procurement and reducing their carbon footprint, they have miserably failed to match their promises. The most widely discussed examples include Disney's initiative to introduce sustainable paper sourcing policy in 2012 and 3M promising to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions.\nSustainable procurement is also used to address issues of , such as inclusiveness, ,  and diversity targets, regeneration and integration.\nExamples include addressing the needs \u2013 whether employment, care, welfare or other \u2013 of groups including , children, the elderly, those with disabilities, adults lacking basic skills, and immigrant populations. Criteria for Socially Responsible Procurement can be applied to every stage of a supply-chain e.g. from mining to assembly and distribution.\nOften differences in the purchase price between a non-sustainable and sustainable alternative are negligible. Yet even where the sustainable option costs more upfront, savings of energy, water and waste over the lifetime of the product or service can provide significant financial savings. On a  level, it can be argued that there are economic benefits in the form of  gains from incorporating whole-life costing into decision-making. [Note: in contrast to most arguments from sustainable procurement proponents, these can be purely private benefits accrued by the procuring organization.]\nIn addition, the creation of sustainable markets is essential for long-term growth while sustainable development requirements foster . There are also potential global applications: sustainable procurement can favor  or ethical practice, and allow extra investment to channeled towards .\nOn a  level, sustainable procurement offers the chance for economic redistribution. Targets might include creation of jobs and wealth in regeneration areas, or assistance for small and/or ethnic minority-owned businesses.\nFor central governments, sustainable procurement is typically viewed as the application of sustainable development criteria to spending and investment decisions. Given high-profile socioeconomic and environmental concerns such as  and , governments are increasingly concerned that our actions meet the needs of the present without compromising the needs of the future.\nPublic spending, which accounts for an average of 12% of GDP in OECD countries, and up to 30% in developing countries, wields enormous purchasing power. Shifting that spending towards more sustainable goods and services can help drive markets in the direction of innovation and , thereby enabling the transition to a green economy. Through Sustainable procurement practices, governments can lead by example and deliver key policy objectives. Sustainable procurement allows governments to mitigate key issues such as , improve resource efficiency, recycling, among others. The key international organizations already increasingly recon gnize public procurement as a means of changing the unsustainable patterns of consumption and production.\nThe United Nations, including its many affiliated agencies, recognize their own responsibilities in contributing to more sustainable patterns of development, maintaining a market behavior which is credible, inspirational and exemplary, and proving that UN agencies stand behind the principles they promote. Through the development of procurement criteria that support sustainability principles, requisitioners and procurers can send strong signals to the market in favor of goods and services that promote sustainability. The United Nations agency destined to develop and promote resource efficiency and more sustainable consumption and production processes, including the promotion of sustainable resource management in a life cycle perspective for goods and services in both developed and developing countries, The United Nations Environmental Programme, , drafted sustainable public procurement implementation guideline to aid in the consideration of society, economy, and the environment in procurement processes\nThe Marrakech Task Force on Sustainable Public Procurement (MTF or SPP) which was managed by Switzerland from 2006 to May 2011 established an approach for the effective implementation of sustainable procurement. This approach was named the MTF Approach to SPP. Since then, the United Nations Environmental Programme have worked together with the Swiss government to develop a project to implement sustainable procurement worldwide. The project named Capacity Building for Sustainable Public Procurement in Developing countries were piloted in 7 different countries, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Lebanon, Mauritius, Tunisia, and Uruguay and since then, the list of countries adopting this newly designed approach to developing has increase adding even more advanced and industrialized nations to be used as case studies to measure the efficiency and benefits of the implementation of sustainable public procurement. In Brazil, the project involved recycled paper, in Costa Rica, the management services was redesigned, toner cartridges for laser printers was the main objective in France, in Hong Kong and China the nations aimed to improve traffic with LED traffic lights retrofit, organic food for school children in Italy, sustainable construction in England, consultancy and temporary staff services was renovated in Scotland, and in the United States, there was a push for the sustainable transportation of waste.\nThe eight case studies reveal a diversity of environmental impacts at various stages of the products\u2019 life cycle. The purchase of remanufactured ink cartridges by the French Ministry of Education has led to a decrease in the amount of waste generated at the manufacturing stage. The construction or services case studies (Yorkshire and Humber Region, UK, and Oregon, USA) demonstrate significant impacts related to the reduction of CO2 emissions, of waste production, and of water consumption. The Ferrara study (Italy) and the recycled paper case (S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil) show positive environmental.\nAlthough the social component of sustainable development has often been considered as the most neglected one, the eight case studies show a strong commitment from public purchasers to tackle social issues. Employment and social inclusiveness issues are considered essential by the public entities who promote these priorities through their procurement processes. Some of the social impacts are directly targeted by tenders, such as the participation of companies employing disabled persons in the French case or the fight against illiteracy in Scotland. Other impacts are the results of the specific purchase, as in the State of S\u00e3o Paulo case (notebooks using recycled paper) which demonstrates a clear positive impact for waste pickers. The analysis of the case studies illustrates the diversity and strength of the recorded sustainable development impacts. Public purchasers can be clearly seen as key potential actors of society, able to impact a wide range of sustainable development fields.\nThe UK in 2005 pledged to be a performance-leader in sustainable procurement by 2009 and commissioned the business-led Sustainable Procurement Task Force to formulate appropriate strategy. Broad-based procurement strategies are prominent across the EU while it is an increasingly influential concern elsewhere, most notably Canada. The US federal government requires certain green procurement practices in its buildings and supports the wide and inclusive use of them. The , an independent establishment and government corporation, is responsible for promoting green procurement and provides federal agencies with selling and purchasing guidelines and suggestions. Green procurement is primarily done by federal contracting personnel and program managers \u2013 but it is not restricted to such professionals.\nAt market-level, sustainable procurement is typically instrumental: authorities seek to address policy .\nGovernment departments and local bodies can use procurement to address certain chosen agendas in buying solutions that will contribute to community or environmental goals, or to diversity or equality targets.\nTo help local governments improve sustainability and reduce environmental impacts the , has developed a Green Procurement Toolkit. Green procurement can help local governments save money, create local green jobs and improve their environmental sustainability.\nUnder sustainable procurement criteria any procuring organization must therefore take a broad approach to sustainability, reflecting localized economic, environmental and social needs as well as cross-cutting sustainable development strategies such as .\n is a membership organization of local governments who recognizes the power of Sustainable Public Procurement to achieve environmental, social and economic benefits. It encourages Public Procurement of Innovation as a means for achieving sustainability.  Among its various activities, it offers a Sustainable Procurement Resource Center  and a Procurement Forum, which can be used by procurers or by anyone interested in these topics.\n is a network of European public authorities and regions that connect, exchange and act on sustainable and innovation procurement.\nOn December 8, 2006 the Greater London Authority became the first public-sector body to publish a sustainable procurement policy, promising to award a \"distinct competitive advantage\" to those companies which demonstrated a commitment to sustainable procurement concerns. The policy reflected the 's enthusiasm for public procurement as a tool for fostering social inclusion, equality and environmental objectives.\nThe GLA also stated that their policy was \"very much as a model for broader government procurement\" but this expectation was not fulfilled in the UK Government's Sustainable Procurement Action Plan, published on March 5, 2007. The Action Plan, which incorporated answers to the Sustainable Procurement Task Force, was explicitly environment-oriented in approach (Ch 4.3) with wider social issues scarcely addressed.\nThis was perhaps surprising, as was press disinterest in the publication. Despite its acknowledged importance among senior politicians and business leaders, publication of the Action Plan received only one national newspaper report, and that was markedly flippant in tone.\nSustainable procurement outside of the United Nations is happening everywhere, in the international community, in states and local authorities, in the private sector and in the civil society. Sustainable procurement is as applicable to the  as the , and certainly its proponents aspire to seeing its application across all areas of the economy due to a vast amount of material available on the internet for organizations and companies wishing to improve their sustainability performance.\nAcquisition of goods and services may account for over 50% of the company's expenses, and may exceed 80% in sectors such as in retailing, electronic and automotive industries - with all this purchasing power, the private sector has a great ability to influence markets. Influencing procurement practice within a private-sector firm is not straightforward for governments, meaning that the companies themselves often have to be self-motivated to embrace sustainability. It becomes a social responsibility for both businesses and workers to promote sustainable procurement in the workplace.\nThe UK's Sustainable Procurement National Action Plan argues that it is \"something the best of the private sector is already doing \u2013 whether through enlightened leadership or shareholder pressure\". It also argues that government purchasing power (circa \u00a3150bn in the UK alone) can apply sustainable procurement principles to present a persuasive case to those in the private sector resisting sustainable procurement practice.\n and sustainable procurement demands the implementation of responsible practices in relation to workers, environment and society to be followed by suppliers as to promote a chain of sustainability between production and consumption.\n (B Corp) demands support for the . B Corp are incentivized to , , and from other . This promotes a chain of sustainable businesses that amplifies its effectiveness.\nWhile there is no strict definition on how organizations implement sustainable procurement, there are two approaches that can be combined:\nThis is where an organization examines a products movement along the  and assesses the   of themselves and of their . This path is commonly used when an organization wishes to understand the impact of a product or product range for strategic and marketing purposes. This approach can also provide a vivid picture of supplier processes.\nAn organization may analyze the CSR management systems of a supplier and whether its practices conform with law and with the CSR standards of \"buying\" organization. Thus, the organization measures the environmental and social risk a supplier may impose upon them. Implemented effectively, this method will show whether a supplier meets the environmental standards of the organization, along with whether suppliers are meeting the requirements of law. Some assessments improve the whole supply chain by providing incentives for other businesses to be more sustainable.\nIn order to assess the CSR Management systems companies can use a variety of tools\u00a0:\n"},

It was founded in 2005. Using the United Nations \u2019s definition of sustainable development as a model, it defines sustainability as:\n ...design, construction, operations and maintenance practices that meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs by attempting to:\n...protect, restore and enhance the ability of landscapes to provide  that benefit humans and other organisms.There is no uniform national standard for a sustainable landscaping project in the USA. Sites are rated according to their impact on ecosystem services: The following ecosystem services have been identified:\n\n \n\n \n\n \nEnhancement of ecosystem services is encouraged throughout the life of any site by providing clear design, construction and management criteria. Sustainability requires that environmental, social and economic demands are integrated. Guidelines supplement existing green building guidelines and include metrics (benchmarks, audits, criteria, indexes etc.) that give some  (a rating system) by clarifying what is sustainable or not sustainable or, more likely, what is more or less sustainable.\nImpacts of a site can be assessed and measured over any spatio-temporal scale. Impacts of a site may be  by having direct measurable impacts on biodiversity and ecology at the site itself, or  when impacts occur away from the site.\nThe following are some site principles for sustainable gardening:\nOne major feature distinguishing sustainable gardens, landscapes and sites from other similar enterprises is the quantification of site sustainability by establishing performance benchmarks. Because sustainability is such a broad concept the environmental impacts of sites can be categorised in numerous ways depending on the purpose for which the figures are required. The process can include minimising negative environmental impacts and maximising positive impacts. As currently applied the environment is usually given priority over social and economic factors which may be added in or regarded as an inevitable and integral part of the management process. A home gardener is likely to use simpler metrics than a professional landscaper.\nThree methods for measuring site sustainability include  developed by the BRE organisation in the UK, Leed, developed in America and the Oxford 360 degree sustainability Index used in Oxford Park and developed by the Oxford Sustainable Group in Scandinavia.\n"},

Other leading figures who envisioned the sustainable city are  , who later founded the company Ecopolis Pty Ltd, as well as authors  and , who have written extensively on the subject. The field of  is sometimes used in planning these cities.\nThere remains no completely agreed upon definition for what a sustainable city should be or completely agreed upon paradigm for what components should be included. Generally, developmental experts agree that a sustainable city should meet the needs of the present without sacrificing the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. The ambiguity within this idea leads to a great deal of variation in terms of how cities carry out their attempts to become sustainable.\nIdeally, a sustainable city creates an enduring way of life across the four domains of , ,  and . Goals of a sustainable city are to be able to feed itself with a sustainable reliance on the surrounding natural environment and have the ability to power itself with . The central focus of this topic is to create the smallest conceivable  while also producing the lowest quantity of  achievable. All of this is to be accomplished by efficiently using the land in ways such as  used materials, , and/or converting . The idea is that these contributions will lead to a decrease of the city's impact on . The Adelaide City Council states that socially sustainable cities should be equitable, diverse, connected, democratic, and provide a good quality of life.\nToday, 55% of the world is estimated to be living in  and the  estimates that by the year 2050, that number will rise to 68%. These large communities provide both challenges and opportunities for  developers. There are distinct advantages to further defining and working towards the goals of sustainable cities. Humans are social creatures and thrive in urban spaces that foster social connections. , an urban studies theorist, focuses on the social impact of sustainable cities and states that cities need to be more than a competitive business climate; they need to be a great people climate that appeals to individuals and families of all types. Because of this, a shift to more dense, urban living would provide an outlet for social interaction and conditions under which humans can prosper. These types of urban areas would also promote the use of public transit, walkability and biking which would benefit citizens health wise but also be environmentally beneficial.\nThese ecological cities are achieved through various means, such as:\nBuildings provide the infrastructure for a functioning city and allow for many opportunities to demonstrate a commitment to sustainability. A commitment to sustainable architecture encompasses all phases of building including the planning, building, and restructuring. Sustainable Site Initiatives is used by landscape architects, designers, engineers, architects, developers, policy-makers and others to align land development and management with innovative sustainable design.\nThe purpose of an eco-industrial park is to connect a number of firms and organizations to work together to decrease their environmental impact while simultaneously improving their economic performance. The community of businesses accomplishes this goal through collaboration in managing environmental and resource issues, such as energy, water, and materials. The components for building an eco-industrial park include natural systems, more efficient use of energy, and more efficient material and water flows Industrial parks should be built to fit into their natural settings in order to reduce environmental impacts, which can be accomplished through plant design, landscaping, and choice of materials. For instance, there is an industrial park in Michigan built by Phoenix Designs that is made almost entirely from recycled materials. The landscaping of the building will include native trees, grasses, and flowers, and the landscaping design will also act as climate shelter for the facility. In choosing the materials for building an eco-industrial park, designers must consider the life-cycle analysis of each medium that goes into the building to assess their true impact on the environment and to ensure that they are using it from one plant to another, steam connections from firms to provide heating for homes in the area, and using renewable energy such as wind and solar power. In terms of material flows, the companies in an eco-industrial park may have common waste treatment facilities, a means for transporting by-products from one plant to another, or anchoring the park around  companies that are recruited to the location or started from scratch. To create more efficient water flows in industrial parks, the processed water from one plant can be reused by another plant and the parks infrastructure can include a way to collect and reuse storm water runoff.\nThe Recycled Park in Rotterdam, the second-largest city in the Netherlands, is an initiative introduced by Recycled Island Foundation, a Netherlands-based organization focused on recycling littered waste via creating their iconic island-parks, among other sustainable projects. Rotterdam's Recycled Park is a cluster of floating, green hexagonal \u201cislands\u201d composed of reused litter. The group has utilized a system of passive litter traps to collect this litter from the Maas River. The park's location upon the Maas River reflects a circular process aimed at creating a more sustainable city.\nOn the underside of the recycled park are materials which will support the growth of plants and wildlife indigenous to the area. This interest in growing the biodiversity of Rotterdam's natural elements is also reflected in other cities. Chicago's Urban Rivers organization is similarly trying to solve this issue by building and growing the Wild Mile of floating parks and forests along the  with the goal of . Both Urban Rivers\u2019 and Recycled Island Foundation's interest in improving the area's biodiversity reflects an interest in greening the built urbanism of the surrounding city.\nRotterdam's Recycled Park may suggest a greater trend in creating floating structures in response to greater climate-change-motivated impacts. The Floating Farm in Rotterdam sustainably approaches food production and transport. Other floating structures include renewable energy-powered houseboats and luxury residences some 800 meters from the coast. The Dutch city of Amsterdam likewise boasts a neighborhood of artificial, floating islands in the suburb of .\nThe idea of expanding both commercial enterprise and residential developments onto the water is oftentimes reflective of the demand to limit land-usage in urban areas. This has various, wide-reaching environmental impacts: reducing the aggregation of the , the zoning efforts expended on engineering and regulating the  (and potentially, the capacity of ), and reduce the demands of the  state.\nThe Recycled Park is a holistic approach to limiting the expense of waste. The employment of greenery has air-purifying effects, to reduce pollution. Additionally, the modular, hexagonal design allows reconstruction of each \u201cisland;\u201d this space thus also offers environmental sustainability, as well as an open space for community-growing and other social opportunities.\n is the process of growing and distributing food, as well as raising animals, in and around a city or in urban area. According to the RUAF Foundation, urban farming is different from rural agriculture because it is integrated into the urban economic and ecological system: urban agriculture is embedded in and interacting with the urban ecosystem. Such linkages include the use of urban residents as laborers; use of typical urban resources (such as utilizing organic waste as compost or urban wastewater for irrigation); direct links with urban consumers; direct impacts on urban ecology (positive and negative); being part of the urban food system; competing for land with other urban functions; being influenced by urban policies and plans. One motivation for urban agriculture in sustainable cites includes saving energy that would be used in food transportation. In order for urban farming to be a successful method of sustainable food growth, cities must allot a common area for community gardens or farms, as well as a common area for a farmers market in which the foodstuffs grown within the city can be sold to the residents of the urban system.\nThe most clearly defined form of walkable urbanism is known as the Charter of . It is an approach for successfully reducing environmental impacts by altering the  to create and preserve smart cities which support . Residents in compact urban neighborhoods drive fewer miles and have significantly lower environmental impacts across a range of measures, compared with those living in  suburbs. The concept of  has also been introduced in Europe to promote sustainable land use patterns that strive for compact cities and a reduction of greenfield land taken by urban sprawl.\n, a recent movement of , promotes a sustainable approach towards construction that appreciates and develops , walkability, , and . This in contrast to  and  architecture and opposes solitary  and suburban sprawl. Both trends started in the 1980s.\nThe Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System\u00ae encourages and accelerates global adoption of sustainable green building and development practices through the creation and implementation of universally understood and accepted tools and performance criteria.\nLEED, or , is an internationally recognized  certification system. LEED recognizes whole building sustainable design by identifying key areas of excellence including: Sustainable Sites, Water Efficiency, Energy and Atmosphere, Materials and Resources, Indoor Environmental Quality, Locations & Linkages, Awareness and Education, Innovation in Design, Regional Priority. In order for a building to become LEED certified sustainability needs to be prioritized in design, construction, and use. One example of sustainable design would be including a  like bamboo. Bamboo is fast growing and has an incredible replacement rate after being harvested. By far the most credits are rewarded for optimizing energy performance. This promotes innovative thinking about alternative forms of energy and encourages increased efficiency.\nSustainable Sites Initiative, a combined effort of the , The Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center at The , and the , is a voluntary national guideline and performance benchmark for sustainable land design, construction and maintenance practices. The building principles of SSI are to design with nature and culture, use a decision-making hierarchy of preservation, conservation, and regeneration, use a system thinking approach, provide regenerative systems, support a living process, use a collaborative and ethical approach, maintain integrity in leadership and research, and finally foster . All of these help promote solutions to common environmental issues such as ,  issues,  and waste, , and health and wellbeing of site users. The main focus is hydrology, soils, vegetation, materials, and human health and well being.\nIn SSI, the main goal for  in sites is to protect and restore existing hydrologic functions.

Currently, transportation systems account for nearly a quarter of the world's energy consumption and carbon dioxide emission. In order to reduce the environmental impact caused by transportation in metropolitan areas, sustainable transportation has three widely agreed upon pillars that it utilizes to create more healthy and productive urban centers.\nThe  states that there are three main ways cities can innovate to make transport more sustainable without increasing journey times - better land use planning, modal shift to encourage people to choose more efficient forms of transport, and making existing transport modes more efficient.\nThe concept of  or a city with large  is often part of the design of a sustainable city. A large part of the  of a city is generated by cars so the car free concept is often considered an integral part of the design of a sustainable city.\nCreated by eco friendly urban planning, the concept of urban proximity is an essential element of current and future sustainable transportation systems. This requires that cities be built and added onto with appropriate population and landmark density so that destinations are reached with reduced time in transit. This reduced time in transit allows for reduced fuel expenditure and also opens the door to alternative means of transportation such as bike riding and walking.\nTransportation in downtown \nFurthermore, close proximity of residents and major landmarks allows for the creation of efficient public transportation by eliminating long sprawled out routes and reducing commute time. This in turn decreases the social cost to residents who choose to live in these cities by allowing them more time with families and friends instead by eliminating part of their commute time.\nSee also:  and \nSustainable transportation emphasizes the use of a diversity of  transportation vehicles in order to reduce greenhouse emissions and diversity fuel demand. Due to the increasingly expensive and volatile cost of energy, this strategy has become very important because it allows a way for city residents to be less susceptible to varying highs and lows in various energy prices.\nAmong the different , the use alternative energy cars and widespread installation of refueling stations has gained increasing importance, while the creation of centralized  and  remains a staple of the sustainable transportation movement.\nIn order to maintain the aspect of  inherent within the concept of sustainable cities, implementing  must include access to transportation by all levels of society. Due to the fact that car and fuel cost are often too expensive for lower income urban residents, completing this aspect often revolves around efficient and accessible public transportation.\nIn order to make public transportation more accessible, the cost of rides must be affordable and stations must be located no more than walking distance in each part of the city. As studies have shown, this accessibility creates a great increase in social and productive opportunity for city residents. By allowing lower income residents cheap and available transportation, it allows for individuals to seek employment opportunities all over the urban center rather than simply the area in which they live. This in turn reduces unemployment and a number of associated social problems such as crime, drug use, and violence.\nAlthough there is not an international policy regarding sustainable cities and there are not established international standards, there is an organization, the  (UCLG) that is working to establish universal urban strategic guidelines. The UCLG a democratic and decentralized structure that operates in Africa, Asia, Eurasia, Europe, Latin America, North America, Middle East, West Asian and a Metropolitan section work to promote a more sustainable society. The 60 members of the UCLG committee evaluate urban development strategies and debate these experiences to make the best recommendations. Additionally, the UCLG accounts for differences in regional and national context. All the organizations are making a great effort to promote this concept by media and internet, and in conferences and workshops. An International conference was held in Italy at Universit\u00e0 del Salento and Universit\u00e0 degli Studi della Basilicata, called 'Green Urbanism', from 12\u201314 October 2016.\nRecently, local and national governments and regional bodies such as the European Union have recognized the need for a holistic understanding of . This is instrumental to establishing an international policy that focuses on cities challenges and the role of the local authorities responses. Generally, in terms of urban planning, the responsibility of local governments are limited to  and infrastructure provision excluding inclusive urban development strategies. The advantages of urban strategic planning include an increase in governance and cooperation that aids local governments in establishing performance based-management, clearly identifying the challenges facing local community and more effectively responding on a local level rather than national level, and improves institutional responses and local decision making. Additionally, it increases dialogue between stakeholders and develops consensus-based solutions, establishing continuity between sustainability plans and change in local government; it places environmental issues as the priority for the sustainable development of cities and serves as a platform to develop concepts and new models of housing, energy and mobility.\nThe City Development Strategies (CDS) addresses new challenges and provides space for innovative policies that involves all stakeholders. The inequality in spatial development and socio-economic classes paired with concerns of  and  are factors in achieving global sustainable cities. According to the  there are differences between regional and national conditions, framework and practice that are overcome in the international commitment to communication and negotiation with other governments, communities and the private sector to continue to develop through innovative and participatory approaches in strategic decisions, building consensus and monitoring performance management and raising investment.\nAccording to , around half of the world's population is concentrated in cities, which is set to rise to 60% within a couple decades. The UCLG has specifically identified 13 global challenges to establishing sustainable cities: demographic change and migration, globalisation of the job market, poverty and unmet Millennium Development Goals, segregation, spatial patterns and urban growth, metropolisation and the rise of urban regions, more political power for local authorities, new actors for developing a city and providing services, decline in public funding for development, the environment and climate change, new and accessible building technologies, preparing for uncertainty and limits of growth and global communications and partnerships.\n\nIn , South Australia (a city of 1.3 million people) Premier Mike Rann (2002 to 2011) launched an urban forest initiative in 2003 to plant 3 million native trees and shrubs by 2014 on 300 project sites across the metro area. The projects range from large habitat restoration projects to local biodiversity projects. Thousands of Adelaide citizens have participated in community planting days. Sites include parks, reserves, transport corridors, schools, water courses and coastline. Only trees native to the local area are planted to ensure genetic integrity. Premier Rann said the project aimed to beautify and cool the city and make it more liveable; improve air and water quality and reduce Adelaide's greenhouse gas emissions by 600,000 tonnes of C02 a year. He said it was also about creating and conserving habitat for wildlife and preventing species loss.\n\nThe Rann government also launched an initiative for Adelaide to lead Australia in the take-up of solar power. In addition to Australia's first 'feed-in' tariff to stimulate the purchase of solar panels for domestic roofs, the government committed millions of dollars to place arrays of solar panels on the roofs of public buildings such as the museum, art gallery, Parliament, Adelaide Airport, 200 schools and Australia's biggest rooftop array on the roof of Adelaide Showgrounds' convention hall which was registered as a power station.\n\nSouth Australia went from zero wind power in 2002 to wind power, making up 26% of its electricity generation by October 2011. In the five years preceding 2011 there was a 15% drop in emissions, despite strong economic growth.\n\nFor Adelaide the South Australian government also embraced a Zero Waste recycling strategy, achieving a recycling rate of nearly 80% by 2011 with 4.3 million tonnes of materials diverted from landfill to recycling. On a per capita basis this was the best result in Australia, the equivalent of preventing more than a million tonnes of C02 entering the atmosphere. In the 1970s container deposit legislation was introduced. Consumers are paid a 10 cent rebate on each bottle, can, or container they return to recycling. In 2009 non-reusable plastic bags used in supermarket checkouts were banned by the Rann Government, preventing 400 million plastic bags per year entering the litter stream. In 2010 Zero Waste SA was commended by a UN Habitat Report entitled 'Solid Waste Management in the World Cities'.\n\nThe  north of Sydney has developed a masterplan for Australia's first low-to-no carbon urban development.\n was created in 1897 and is the third largest metropolis in Brazil, with 2.4 million inhabitants. The Strategic Plan for Belo Horizonte (2010\u20132030) is being prepared by external consultants based on similar cities' infrastructure, incorporating the role of local government, state government, city leaders and encouraging citizen participation. The need for environmental sustainable development is led by the initiative of new government following planning processes from the state government. Overall, the development of the metropolis is dependent on the land regularization and infrastructure improvement that will better support the cultural technology and economic landscape.

This bus line increased ridership and helped The Euclid Corridor begin to see the redevelopment of abandoned properties as well as investment in development of commerce, to the tune of $4.3 billion. This created thousands of square feet of retail space and thousands of jobs. The success of the revitalization of the Euclid Corridor is due in large part to engaged community leaders, community members, and NGO's like MidTown Cleveland who worked on ensuring that there was a variety of housing investments. EPA assisted with the redevelopment of abandoned space through their brownfield assessment grants and HUD provided mortgage insurance on properties to aid in the development of Euclid Avenue.\n\nFollowing a shift from the cotton production that once thrived in the west end of , this part of the city began to see a flight of its residents and with it the abandonment and decay of its buildings and facilities, higher crime rates, and more low-income households. In 2010, HUD and DOT awarded the city $1.8 million to support a three-year planning initiative which sought to improve affordable housing, transportation, and increase economic development. The HUD provided a loan to encourage economic growth, specifically through the conversion of an old cotton warehouse into an area of retail shops, offices, and restaurants known as West End Market. The success of West End Market led to 230 building permits being issued around the area in a three-year period, resulting in a successful arts district that created jobs as well as drew tourists and locals.

This law allows for Maryland counties and municipalities to use funds generated from increased property tax values to fund improvement projects in sustainable communities. Sample projects include expanding sidewalks, the development of tree planting on streets and parks, as well as improvements to water and sewer infrastructure to help encourage economic growth and improve quality of life.\nThe state of California passed the , also known as SB 375. The law aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through transportation, housing, and land use planning. Under the SB 375, the state is broken up into Metropolitan Planning Organizations which are each responsible for developing Sustainable Community Strategies that will help the state reach its goal of reduced emissions. These strategies are then evaluated by the 's Air Resources Board. Under the Sustainable Community Strategy, the city of  plans to double transit service and increase bike lanes, offering more transportation choices and reducing vehicle emissions. The city of  also plans to increase funding towards more transportation choices as well as promote more multi-family housing near high transit areas. The Southern California Strategies include transit expansion, developing housing closer to public transportation, increasing funding for biking and pedestrians, and the creation of jobs, with most being near public transit.\nCities are defined as  units that have small divisions of government within them.

This allows for a sustainable community as  and social justice are created.\nThe city of  to create a sustainable community through political involvement has dedicated studies to discovering why citizens are or are not politically active. Studies from Quebec have shown that citizens\u2019  is a large part in determining  in politics. When citizens lack the internal belief that one can make change in government and the external belief that the government will make changes according to citizen concerns, political participation dwindles as citizens believe no change will occur. When becoming politically active, a citizen takes into account the history of the city government, the government's actions, and government interactions with other citizens.\nAfter noting the city's sustainability level it is important to note what kinds of communities are targeted and how they are affected through these programs and what kinds of strategies are being used to try to create and transform sustainable communities.\nThe  created by former Vermont Governor, Madeleine M.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_fashion", "title": "SustainablefashionWikipedia", "body": " is a movement and process of fostering change to fashion products and the fashion system towards greater ecological integrity and social justice. Sustainable fashion concerns more than addressing fashion textiles or products. It comprises addressing the whole system of fashion. This means dealing with interdependent social, cultural, ecological and financial systems. It also means considering fashion from the perspective of many stakeholders - users and producers, all living species, contemporary and future dwellers on earth. Sustainable fashion therefore belongs to, and is the responsibility of, citizens, public sector and private sector. A key example of the need for  in fashion is that the benefits of product-level initiatives, such as replacing one fiber type for a less environmentally harmful option, is eaten up by increasing volumes of fashion products. An adjacent term to sustainable fashion is \nThe origins of the sustainable fashion movement are intertwined with those of the modern , of which it is a part, and specifically the publication in 1962 of the book  by American biologist . Carson's book exposed the serious and widespread pollution associated with the use of agricultural chemicals, a theme that is still important in the debate around the environmental and social impact of fashion today. The decades which followed saw the impact of human actions on the environment to be more systematically investigated, including the effects of industrial activity, and to new concepts for mitigating these effects, notably , a term coined in 1987 by the .\nIn the early 1990s and roughly coinciding with the United Nations conference on Environment and Development in 1992, popularly known as the , 'green issues' (as they were called at the time) made their way into fashion and textiles publications. Typically these publications featured the work of well-known companies such as  and , who in the late 1980s brought environmental concerns into their businesses. The owners of those companies at that time,  and ,  were outdoorsmen and witnessed the environment being harmed by over production and over consumption of material goods. They commissioned research into the impacts of fibers used in their companies. For Patagonia, this resulted in a  for four fibers, cotton, wool, nylon and polyester. For ESPRIT the focus was on cotton\u2014and finding better alternatives to it\u2014which represented 90% of their business at that time. Interestingly, a similar focus on materials impact and selection is still the norm in the sustainable fashion thirty years on.\nThe principles of 'green' or 'eco' fashion, as put forward by these two companies, was based on the philosophy of the deep ecologists , , and , and design theorist . This imperative is also reliant on feminist understanding of human-nature relationships, interconnectedness and \u201cethics of care\u201d as advocated by , , , and . The legacy of the early work of Patagonia and ESPRIT continues to shape the fashion industry agenda around sustainability today. They co-funded the first organic cotton conference held in 1991 in Visalia, California. And in 1992, the ESPRIT ecollection, developed by head designer , was launched at retail and it was based on the Eco Audit Guide, published by the Elmwood Institute. Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, the movement in sustainable fashion broadened to include many brands. Though the primary focus has remained on improving the impacts of products through fiber and fabric processing and material provenance, Doug Tompkins and Yvon Chouinard were early to note the fundamental cause of unsustainability: exponential growth and consumption. ESPRIT placed an ad in  in 1990 making a plea for responsible consumption. In 2011 the brand Patagonia ran an ad and a PR campaign \"Don't buy this jacket\" with a picture of Patagonia merchandise. This message was intended to encourage people to consider the effect that  has on the environment, and to purchase only what they need.\nIn parallel with the industry agenda, a research agenda around sustainable fashion has been in development since the early 1990s, with the field now having its own history, dynamics, politics, practices, sub-movements and evolution of analytical and critical language. The field is broad in scope and includes technical projects that seek to improve the resource efficiency of existing operations, the work of brands and designers to work within current priorities as well as those which look to fundamentally reimagine the fashion system differently, including the growth logic. In 2019, a group of researchers formed the Union for Concerned Researchers in Fashion to advocate for radical and co-ordinated research activity commensurate with the challenges of  and climate change. In the fall of 2019, the UCRF received the North Star Award at the Green Carpet Fashion Awards, an organization focused on the promotion of sustainability in the fashion industry. As a non-profit organization focused on instigating debate and disseminating scholarly research, the UCRF believes that responses from the fashion industry regarding today's climate crisis has been oversimplified or obstructed by limited business models. According to one of the founders, the UCRF hopes that the award helps bring light to the issues that continually plague the fashion industry. \nThe fashion industry has a clear opportunity to act differently, pursuing profit and growth while also creating new value and deeper wealth for society and therefore for the world economy. It comes with an urgent need to place environmental, social, and ethical improvements on management's agenda. The goal of sustainable fashion is to create flourishing ecosystems and communities through its activity. This may include: increasing the value of local production and products; prolonging the lifecycle of materials; increasing the value of timeless garments; reducing the amount of waste; and to reducing the harm to the environment created as a result of production and consumption. Another of its aims can sometimes be seen to educate people to practice environmentally friendly consumption by promoting the \"green consumer\".\nThere is however a growing concern that \"green consumerism\" that takes profit and economic growth as primary objectives can deliver the sustainable agenda needed to mitigate and reverse the pollution, labor exploitation and inequalities fashion industry promotes and profits from. If the business model is based on selling more units of clothing, this is unsustainable, however much the garments are \"eco friendly.\" Thus the industry has to change its basic premise for profit, yet this is slow coming as it requires a large shift in business practices, models and tools for assessment. This became apparent in the discussions following the Burberry report of the brand burning unsold goods worth around \u00a328.6m (about $37.8 million) in 2018, exposing not only overproduction and subsequent destruction of unsold stock as a normal business practice, but the behaviours amongst brands that actively undermine a sustainable fashion agenda.\nThe challenge for making fashion more sustainable requires to rethink the whole system, and this call for action is in itself not new. The Union of Concerned Researchers in Fashion has argued that the industry is still discussing the same ideas as were originally mooted in the late 1980s and early 1990s. When taking the long view and examining fashion and sustainability progress since the 1990s, there are few actual advances in ecological terms. As the Union observes, \"So far, the mission of sustainable fashion has been an utter failure and all small and incremental changes have been drowned by an explosive economy of extraction, consumption, waste and continuous labour abuse.\" \nA frequently asked question of those working in the area of sustainable fashion is whether the field itself is an oxymoron. This reflects the seemingly irreconcilable possibility of bringing together fashion (understood as constant change, and tied to business models based on continuous replacement of goods) and sustainability (understood as continuity and resourcefulness). The apparent paradox dissolves if fashion is seen more broadly, not only as a process aligned to expansionist business models, and consumption of new clothing, but instead as mechanism that leads to more engaged ways of living on a precious and changing earth.\nFashion is, per definition, a phenomenon related to time: a popular expression in a certain time and context. This also affects the perception of what is and should be made more sustainable - if fashion should be \"fast\" or \"slow\" - or if it should be more exclusive or inclusive. Like much other design, the objects of fashion exist in the interzone between desire and discard along a temporal axis, between the shimmering urge towards life and the thermodynamic fate of death. As noted by cultural theorist Brian Thill, \"waste is every object, plus time.\"\nWhen it comes down to the garments themselves, their durability depends on their use and \"metabolism\" - certain garments are made to withstand long use (ex. outdoor and hiking wear, winter jackets) whereas other garments have a quicker turn-around (ex. a party top). This means some garments have properties and a use-life that could be made more durable, whereas others should be compostable or recyclable for quicker disintegration. Some garments age well and acquire patina and a romantic enchantment not unlike the wonder, fascination and grandeur of historical ruins, whereas the derelict and discarded rags of last season is an eyesore and nuisance; the first connotes a majesty of taste, whereas the second is the underclass of waste.\nOne of the most apparent reasons for the current unsustainable condition of the fashion system is related to the temporal aspects of fashion; the continuous stream of new goods onto the market, or what is popularly called \".\" The term has come to signify cheap, accessible and on-trend clothes, sourced through global production chains and sold through chains such as H&M, Zara, Forever21, etc. The 2012 book  by journalist Elizabeth L. Cline gives a clear introduction to the rise of disposable consumption of fashion and its impacts on the planet, the economy and consumer relationships with clothing.\nHowever, the \"fast\" aspect of consumption is primarily a problem to the environment when done on a massive scale. As long as fast conspicuous consumption was reserved to the rich, the global impact was not reaching public attention or seen as a problem. That is, \"fast\" shopping sprees of  is not seen as a problem, rather it is celebrated (for example in movies such as ), whereas when people with less means shop fast fashion it is seen as unethical and a problem. Today, the speed of fast fashion is common across the whole industry as exclusive fashion replicates the fast fashion chains with continuous releases of collections and product drops: the quality of a garment does not necessarily translate to a slower pace of consumption and waste.\n can be seen as an alternative approach against , based on principles of the  movement. Characteristics of sustainable fashion match the philosophies of \"\" in that emotional, ecological and ethical qualities are favored over uniform and bland convenience with minimal friction. It requires a changed infrastructure and a reduced through-put of goods. Categorically, slow fashion is neither business-as-usual nor just involving design classics. Nor is it production-as-usual but with long lead times. Slow fashion is a vision of the fashion sector built from a different starting point. Slow fashion is a fashion concept that reflects a perspective, which respects human living conditions, biological, cultural diversity and scarce global resources and creates unique, personalized products.\nSlow fashion challenges growth fashion's obsession with mass-production and globalized style and becomes a guardian of diversity. It changes the power relations between fashion creators and consumers and forges new relationships and trust that are only possible at smaller scales. It fosters a heightened state of awareness of the design process and its impacts on resource flows, workers, communities, and ecosystems. \nSlow fashion often consists of durable products, traditional production techniques or design concepts that strive to be season-less or last aesthetically and materially for longer periods of time. The impact of slowness aims to affect many points of the production chain. For workers in the textile industry in developing countries, slow fashion means higher wages. For end-users, slow fashion means that the goods are designed and manufactured with greater care and high-quality products. From an environmental point of view, it means that there is less clothing and industrial waste that are removed from use following transient trends. Emphasis is put on durability; emotionally, materially, aesthetically and/or through services that prolong the use-life of garments. New ideas and product innovations are constantly redefining slow fashion, so using a static, single definition would ignore the evolving nature of the concept.\nExamples of stability of expression over long times are abundant in the history of dress, not least in ethnic or folk dress, ritual or coronation robes, clerical dress, or the uniforms of the . The emphasis on slowness in branding is thus an approach that is specific for a niche in the market (such as Western-educated middle-class) that has since the 1990s become dominated by \"fast\" models. One of the earliest brands that gained global fame with an explicit focus on slow fashion, the UK brand People Tree, embraces the concept of ethical trade, manufactures all products in accordance with ethical commerce standards and supports local producers and craftsmen in developing countries. The People Tree brand is known as the first brand in the world that received the Ethical Trade Brand award, which was given in 2013. In addition to adopting ethical trade, the brand also prefers to use nature-friendly materials, textile products with GOTS certification and local, natural, recyclable material.\nThe concept of slow fashion is however not without its controversies, as the imperative of slowness is a mandate emerging from a position of privilege. To stop consuming \"fast fashion\" strikes against low income consumers whose only means to access trends is through cheap and accessible goods. Those who are already having a high position in society can afford to slow down and cement their status and position, while those on their way up resent being told to stay at the lower rungs of the status hierarchy. Another obstacle that the \"slow fashion\" paradigm is facing is related to consumers' behaviour towards the consumption of fashion and specifically clothing . In fact, sustainability conscious consumers, that usually take into account social and environmental implications of their purchases, may experience an attitude-behaviour gap preventing them to change their consumptions habits when it comes to choose ethical clothing. Purchasing fashion is still perceived as an action connected to social status and it is still strongly emotionally driven.\nThe environmental impact of fashion also depends on how much and how long a garment is used. With the  trend, garments tend to be used half as much as compared to 15 years ago. This is due to the inferior quality of fabrics used but also a result of a significant increase of collections that are being released by the fashion industry. Typically, a garment used daily over years has less impact than a garment used once to then be quickly discarded. Studies have shown that the washing and drying process for pair of classic jeans is responsible for almost two-thirds of the energy consumed through the whole of the jeans' life, and for underwear about 80% of total energy use comes from laundry processes. Thus, use and wear practices affect the lifecycles of garments and needs to be addressed for larger systemic impact.\nHowever, there is a significant difference between making a product last from making a long-lasting product. The quality of the product must reflect the appropriate fit into its lifecycle. Certain garments of quality can be repaired and cultivated with emotional durability. Low-quality products that deteriorate rapidly are not as suitable to be \"enchanted\" with emotional bonds between user and product.\nAs highlighted in the research of Irene Maldini, slowing down (in the sense of keeping garments longer) does not necessarily translate into lower volumes of purchased units. Maldini's studies expose how slow fashion, in the sense of longer lasting use phase of garments, tends to indicate that garments stay in the wardrobe longer, stored or hoarded, but does not mean less resources are used in producing garments. Thus slowness comes to mean wardrobes with more lasting products, but the consumption volume and in-flow into the wardrobe/storage stays the same.\nThe textiles and fashion industries are amongst the leading industries that affect the environment negatively. One of the industries that greatly jeopardizes environmental sustainability is the textiles and fashion industry, which thus also bears great responsibilities. Globalization has made it possible to produce clothing at increasingly lower prices, prices so low, and collections shifting so fast, that many consumers consider fashion to be disposable. However, fast, and thus disposable, fashion adds to pollution and generates environmental hazards, in production, use and disposal.   \nPutting the environmental perspective at the center, rather than the logic of the industry, is thus an urgent concern if fashion is to become more sustainable. The Earth Logic fashion research action plan argues for \"putting the health and survival of our planet earth and consequently the future security and health of all species including humans, before industry, business and economic growth.\" In making this argument the Earth Logic plan explicitly connects the global fashion system with the 2018 IPCC .  \nFurthermore, the Earth Logic fashion research action plan sets out a range of possible areas for work in sustainable fashion that scientific and research evidence suggests are the most likely to deliver change of the scale and pace needed to respond to challenges like climate change. Earth Logic\u2019s point of departure is that the planet, and its people, must be put first, before profit. It replaces the logic of economic growth, which is arguably the single largest factor limiting change towards sustainable fashion, with the logic that puts earth at its center.   \nThe clothing industry has one of the highest impacts on the planet. High water usage, pollution from chemical treatments used in dyeing and preparation and the disposal of large amounts of unsold clothing through incineration or landfill deposits are hazardous to the environment. There is a growing , the current usage level of fashion materials (79 billion cubic meters annually) is very concerning, because textile production mostly takes place in areas of fresh water stress. Only around 20% of clothing is recycled or reused, huge amounts of fashion product end up as waste in landfills or is incinerated. It has been estimated that in the UK alone around 350,000 tons of clothing ends up as landfill every year. According to Earth Pledge, a  committed to promoting and supporting , \"At least 8,000 chemicals are used to turn raw materials into textiles and 25% of the world's  are used to grow non-organic cotton. This causes irreversible damage to people and the , and still two thirds of a garment's  will occur after it is purchased.\" The average American throws away nearly 70 pounds of clothing per year. There is an increasing concern as microfibers from synthetic fabrics are polluting the earths waters through the process of laundering. Microfibers are tiny threads that are shed from fabric. These microfibers are too small to be captured in waste water treatment plants filtration systems and they end up entering our natural water systems and as a result contaminating our food chain. One study found that 34% of microplastics found in oceans come from the textile and clothing industry and majority of them were made of polyester, polyethylene, acrylic, and elastane. Eliminating synthetic materials used in clothing products can prevent harmful synthetics and microfibers from ending up in the natural environment.\nOne of the main social issues related to fashion concerns labor. Since the  in 1911, labor rights in the fashion industry has been at the center of this issue. The  at Rana Plaza, where 1138 people died, put the spotlight once again on the lack of transparency, poor working conditions and hazards in fashion production. Attention is increasingly being placed on labour rights violations in other parts of the whole fashion product lifecycle from textile production and processing, retail and distribution and modelling to the recycling of textiles. Whilst the majority of fashion and textiles are produced in Asia, Central America, Turkey, North Africa, the Caribbean and Mexico, there is still production across Europe where exploitative working conditions are also found such as in Leicester in the UK Midlands and Central and Eastern Europe.\nThe fashion industry benefits from racial, class and gender inequalities. These inequalities and pressure from brands and retailers in the form of low prices and short lead times contribute to exploitative working conditions and low wages. Also \"local\" production, such as garments labeled as \"Made in Italy\" are engaged in global sourcing of labor and worker exploitation, bypassing unions and social welfare contracts.\nThe number of workers employed in textiles, clothing and footwear is unknown due to the differences in statistical measures. It is generally accepted that at least 25 million people, the majority women, work in garment manufacture and up to 300 million in cotton alone. Nevertheless, it is really difficult to estimate exactly how many people work in the production sector, because small-scale manufacturing and contracting firms that operate illegally continue to exist within the industry. On the 24th of April 2013, Rana Plaza disaster happened as one of the biggest tragedies in history of the fashion industry. The search for the dead ended on 13 May 2013 with a death toll of 1,134. Approximately 2,500 injured people were rescued from the building alive. It is considered the deadliest garment-factory disaster in history, as well as the deadliest structural failure in modern human history.\nThe environmental impact of fashion also affects communities located close to production sites. There is little easily accessible information about these impacts, but it is known that water and land pollution from toxic chemicals used to produce and dye fabrics and have serious negative consequences for the people living near factories. At the global level, fashion is contributing to climate change and threatens biodiversity, which have social consequences for everyone.\nSupply chain transparency has been a recurring controversy for the fashion industry, not least since the Rana Plaza accident. The issue has been pushed by many labor organizations, not least Clean Clothes Campaign and . Over the last years, over 150 major brands including Everlane, Filippa K and H&M have answered by publicizing information about their factories online. Every year, Fashion Revolution publishes a Fashion Transparency Index which rates the world's largest brands and retailers according to how much information they disclose about their suppliers, supply chain policies and practices, and social and environmental impact.\nHowever, the focus on transparency and traceability has so far not shown the promise expected. Even if a consumer can find information on the clothing label, such as the address of the factory and how many people work there, it says nothing about the salaries and living conditions of the workers, the factory's subcontracting practices, or the environmental impact of sourcing and production. The focus on transparency has so far not bridged information with systemic action and impact. While the agenda of transparency is honourable and important, it is toothless if not paired with real improvements, policy change and legal action which holds corporations and factories responsible for misconduct.\nIn addition, fashion companies are criticised for the lack of size, age, physical ability, gender and racial diversity of models used in photo shoots and catwalks. A more radical and systemic critique of social inequality in fashion concerns the exclusion and aesthetic supremacy inherent and accentuated through fashion that still remains unquestioned under the current environmentally focused discourse on sustainable fashion.\nIt is worth noticing that while social \"inclusivity\" has become almost a norm amongst brands marketing ethical and sustainable fashion, the norm for what is considered a \"beautiful\" and \"healthy\" body keeps narrowing down under what researchers have called the current \"wellness syndrome.\" With the positive thinking of inclusivity, the assumption is that you can be whatever you want to be, and thus if you are not living up to the ideals it is your own fault. This optimism hides the diktat of aesthetic wellness, which turns inclusion into an obligation to look good and be dressed in fashionable clothes, a \"democratic\" demand for aesthetic as well as ethical perfection, as argued by philosopher Heather Widdows.\nThe impact of fashion across the planet is unevenly distributed. Whereas much of the benefits of cheap and accessible clothes targets and benefits the socially mobile classes in metropolitan areas in the , developing countries take a much proportion of the negative impact from the fashion system in terms of waste, pollution, and ecological injustices.\nThe current focus on solutions related to \",\" which are primarily promoted through brand initiatives, fails to address the global impact of the fashion system. Not only does it push responsibility for systemic issues onto the individual, but it also primarily positions fashion in a Western consumerism context, and puts Euro-centric models of status, individualism, and consumerism as universal models for social life and aspirations.\nChina has emerged as the largest exporter of fast fashion, accounting for 30% of world apparel exports. However, some Chinese workers make as little as 12\u201318 cents per hour working in poor conditions. Each year Americans purchase approximately 1 billion garments made in China. Today's biggest factories and mass scale of apparel production emerged from two developments in history. The first involved the opening up of China and Vietnam in the 1980s to private and foreign capital and investments in the creation of export-oriented manufacturing of garments, footwear, and plastics, part of a national effort to boost living standards, embrace modernity, and capitalism. Second, the retail revolution within the U.S. (example Wal-Mart, Target, Nike) and Western Europe, where companies no longer manufactured but rather contracted out their production and transformed instead into key players in design, marketing, and logistics, introducing many new different product lines manufactured in foreign-owned factories in China. It is the convergence of these two phenomena that has led to the largest factories in history from apparels to electronics. In contemporary global supply chains it is retailers and branders who have had the most power in establishing arrangements and terms of production, not factory owners.  Fierce global competition in the garment industry translates into poor working conditions for many laborers in developing nations. Developing countries aim to become a part of the world's apparel market despite poor working conditions and low pay. Countries such as Honduras and Bangladesh export large amounts of clothing into the United States every year.\nAt the heart of the controversy concerning \"fast fashion\" lies the acknowledgement that the \"problem\" of unsustainable fashion is that cheap, accessible and on-trend clothes have become available to people of poorer means. This means more people across the world have adopted the consumption habits that in the mid-twentieth century were still reserved for the rich. To put it differently, the economic concern of fashion is that  people now have access to updating their wardrobes as often as the rich. That is, \"fast\" fashion is only a problem when poor people engage in it. In alignment with this, blame is often put on poor consumers; they don't buy quality goods, buy too much and too cheap, etc.\nThe economic concerns of fashion also means many of the sustainable \"solutions\" to fashion, such as buying high-quality goods to last longer, are not accessible to people with less means. From an economic perspective, sustainability thus remains a moralizing issue of educated classes teaching the less educated \"responsible consumption,\" and a debate that mainly concerns promoting frugality and austerity to those with less means. It is seen as an opportunity by businesses that allow resale of luxury goods. \nThe distribution of value within the fashion industry is another economic concern, with garment workers and textile farmers and workers receiving low wages and prices.\n refers to fabrics derived from eco-friendly resources, such as sustainably grown fiber crops or recycled materials. It also refers to how these fabrics are made. Historically, being environmentally conscious towards clothing meant (1) buying clothes from  or any shops that sell , or (2) donating used clothes to shops previously mentioned, for reuse or resale. In modern times, with a prominent trend towards  and being \u2018green\u2019, sustainable clothing has  expanded towards (1) reducing the amount of clothing discarded to landfills, and (2) decreasing the environmental impact of agro-chemicals in producing conventional fiber crops (e.g. cotton).\nUnder the accordance of sustainability, recycled clothing upholds the principle of the \"Three R\u2019s of the Environment\": , as well as the \"Three Legs of Sustainability\": Economics, Ecology, and Social Equity.\nThrough the utilization of recycled material for the manufacturing of clothing, this provides an additional realm of economic world profit. Sustainable Clothing will provide a new market for additional job opportunities, continuous net flow of money in the global economy, and the consumption reduction of raw materials and virgin resources. Source reduction or reducing the use of raw materials and virgin resources can ultimately reduce carbon emissions during the manufacturing process as well as the resources and carbon emissions that are related to the transportation process. This also prevents the unsustainable usage of extracting materials from the Earth by making use of what has already been used (i.e. recycling).\nRecycled or reclaimed fibres are recovered from either pre or post-consumer sources. Those falling into the category of 'pre-consumer' are unworn/unused textile wastes from all the various stages of manufacture. Post-consumer textile waste could be any product which has been worn/used and have (typically) been discarded or donated to charities. Once sorted for quality and colour, they can be shredded (pulled, UK or picked, US) into a fibrous state. According to the specification and end use, these fibres can be blended together or with 'new' fibre.\nWhile most textiles can be recycled, in the main they are downgraded almost immediately into low-quality end-uses, such as filling materials. The limited range of recycled materials available reflects the market dominance of cheap virgin fibres and the lack of technological innovation in the recycling industry. For 200 years recycling technology has stayed the same; fibres are extracted from used fabric by mechanically tearing the fabric apart using carding machines. The process breaks the fibres, producing much shorter lengths that tend to result in a low quality yarn. Textiles made from synthetic fibres can also be recycled chemically in a process that involves breaking down the fibre at the molecular level and then repolymerizing the feedstock. While chemical recycling is more energy intensive than mechanical pulling, the resulting fibre tends to be of more predictable quality. The most commonly available recycled synthetic fibre is polyester made from plastic bottles, although recycled nylon is also available\n\nIn addition to promoting a sounder environment by producing newer clothing made with sustainable, innovative materials, clothing can also be donated to charities, sold into consignment shops, or recycled into other materials. These methods reduce the amount of landfill space occupied by discarded clothes. According to the 's 2008 Report on Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), Generation, Recycling, and Disposal in the United States defines clothing as non-durable\u00a0\u2013 generally lasts less than three years\u00a0\u2013 textiles. In 2008, approximately 8.78\u00a0millions of tons of textiles were generated, 1.45\u00a0millions of tons were recovered and saved from landfills resulting in a rate of almost 17%. The EPA report also states that the amount of MSW being \"Discarded\" is 54%, \"Recovered\" is 33%, and \"Combusted with \" is 13%. Approximately two-thirds of clothing materials are sent to landfills, making it the fastest growing component of waste in the household waste stream. As of 2009, textiles disposed of in landfill sites have risen from 7% to 30% within the last five years.Total MSW Generation by category, 2008, 250 million tons (before recycling)\nUpcycling in fashion signifies the process of reusing the unwanted and discarded materials (ex. fabric scraps or clothes) into new materials or products without compromising the value and the quality of the used material. In order to implement the upcycling method, it is important to have an overview of the textile waste available because this is what dictates the garment that can be created. Using upcycling in fashion design emphasizes the importance of a local approach. Thus, both the input material (waste) and the production ideally should be local. Since levels of waste production and volumes of waste can differ by region, the first step to collecting materials for upcycling is to carry out a local textile waste study.  The definition of textile waste can be production waste, pre-consumer waste, and post-consumer waste.\nTypically, upcycling creates something new and better from the old or used or disposed items. The process of upcycling requires a blend of factors like environmental awareness, creativity, innovation and hard work and results in a unique sustainable product. Upcycling aims at the development of products truly sustainable, affordable, innovative and creative. For example, downcycling produces cleaning rags from worn T-shirts, whereas upcycling recreates the shirts into a value-added product like unique handmade braided rug. \nUpcycling can be seen as one of the waste management strategies. There are different types of strategies. From least to most resource-intensive, the strategies are the reuse of product, repairing and reconditioning to keep products as long as possible, recycling the raw materials. The reuse of textile products 'as is' brings significant environmental savings. In the case of clothing, the energy used to collect, sort and resell second-hand garments in between 10 and 20 times less than that needed to make a new item.\nThere are negative social and environmental impacts at all stages of the fashion product life: materials production and processing, manufacture of garments, retail and marketing, use and maintenance and at the discard phase. For some products, the environmental impact can be greater at the use phase than material production.\nConsumer engagement challenges the \"passive\" mode of ready-to-wear fashion where consumers have few interfaces and little incentive to be active with their garments; to repair, change, update, swap, and learn from their wardrobe. The term \"folk fashion\" has been used in the emphasis on craft engagements with garments where the community heritage of skills are in focus. There are currently many designers trying to find ways that experiment with new models of action that deposes passivity and indifference while preserving the positive social dynamics and sensibilities fashion offers, often in relation to 's notion of the \"\" (portmanteau of producer and consumer). Notions of , fashion, and fashion  are parts of such endeavors, mixing techniques of dissemination with empowerment, reenechantment and 's \".\" An example of such consumer engagement can be Giana Gonzalez and her project \"\" which has tested such methods across the world since 2006. As highlighted in the research of Jennifer Ballie, there is also an increasing interest across industry to produce unique experiences amongst users, connecting co-design with social media apps and tools to enhance the user experience of consumers.\nEnhancing the lifespan of products have been yet another approach to sustainability, yet still only in its infancy. Upmarket brands have long supported the lifespan of their products through , such as re-waxing of classic outdoor jackets, or repairs of expensive hand-bags, yet more accessible brands do still not offer even spare buttons in their garments. One such approach concerns , yet with fashion's dependency on continuous updates, and consumer's desire to follow trends, there is a significant challenge to make garments last long through emotional attachment. As with memories, not all are pleasant, and thus a focus on emotional attachment can result in favoring a normative approach to what is considered a good enough memory to manifest emotionally in a garment. Cultural theorist Peter Stallybrass approaches this challenge in his essay on poverty, textile memory, and the coat of Karl Marx.\nClothing swapping can further promote the reduction, reuse, and recycling of clothing. By reusing clothing that's already been made and recycling clothing from one owner to another, source reduction can be achieved. This moves away from usage of new raw materials to make more clothing available for consumption. Through the method of clothing swapping, an alternative resource for consumers to ultimately save in regards to money and time is provided. It reduces transportation emissions, costs, and the time it takes to drive and search through the chaos of most clothing stores. Swapping clothes further promotes the use of sustainable  and the internet as well as an increase of social bonds through online communication or effective personal communication in \"clothing swap parties\". The EPA states, that by reusing items, at the source waste can be diverted from ending up in landfills because it delays or avoids that item's entry in the waste collection and disposal system.\nPeople can opt to donate clothing to charities. In the UK, a charity is a  that is given special tax form and distinct legal status. A charity is \"a foundation created to promote the public good\".  People donating clothing to charitable organizations in America are often eligible for , albeit the donations are .\nGenerally,  often sell donated clothing rather than directly giving the clothing away. Charities keep 10% of donated clothing for their high quality and retail value for the thrift shops. Charities sell the rest of the donations to  businesses.\nThe following is a list of few charitable organizations known for accepting clothing donations.\nAn Evangelical Christian-based non-profit organization founded in 1865, United Kingdom.\nA non-profit organization founded in 1902, United States, at Boston, MA. Originally started as an urban outreach \nA non-profit organization originally named Charity Organization Society, established 1887, United States. Currently a coalition of charitable organizations.\nA non-profit organization founded in 1942, United Kingdom. Formerly Oxfam Committee for Famine Relief. Originally established to mitigate famines in Greece caused by Allied naval blockades during World War II.\nThere are \"charities\" that are actually for-profit organizations. These organizations are often multibillion-dollar firms that keep profits accrued from selling donated clothing. Monetary donations are given for public goodwill, but only at relatively few percentages. For example, , a supposedly non-profit organization that collects donated clothing, reportedly gives only 11% of its total income to charities. Such organizations often use  to collect clothes. These drop-off boxes look similar to their non-profit counterparts, which mislead the public into donating their clothes to them. Such public deception prompted backlash, one example where a mayor called for the city's removal of for-profit clothing donation bins. To search for reputable charities, see 's website.\nIn \u2019s terms, a clothing consignment shop sells clothes that are owned not by the shop\u2019s owner but by the individual who had given (or consigned) the items to the shop for the owner to sell. The shop owner/seller is the  and the owner of the items is the . Both the consignor and the consignee receive portions of the profit made from the item. However, the consignor will not be paid until the items are sold. Therefore, unlike donating clothing to charities, people who consign their clothes to shops can make profit.\nAccording to an ABC News report, charities keep approximately 10% of all the donated clothing received.  These clothes tend to be good quality, fashionable, and high valued fabrics that can easily be sold in charities\u2019 thrift shops. Charities sell the other 90% of the clothing donations to textile recycling firms.\nTextile recycling firms process about 70% of the donated clothing into industrial items such as rags or cleaning cloths. However, 20-25% of the  clothing is sold into an international market.  Where possible, used jeans collected from America, for example, are sold to low-income customers in Africa for modest prices, yet most end up in landfill as the average US sized customer is several sizes bigger than the global average.\nThere is a broad range of organisations purporting to support sustainable fashion, some representing particular stakeholders, some addressing particular issues, and some seeking to increase the visibility of the sustainable fashion movement. They also range from the local to global. It is important to examine the interests and priorities of the organisations.\nThere are many factors when considering the  of a material. The renewability and source of a , the process of how a raw fiber is turned into a , the impact of preparation and dyeing of the fibers, energy use in production and preparation, the  of the people producing the materials, and the material's total , transportation between production plants, chemicals used to keep shipments fresh in containers, shipping to retail and consumer, how the material will be cared for and washed, the processes of repairs and updates, and what happens to it at the end of life. The indexing of the textile journeys is thus extremely complex. In sustainability, there is no such thing as a single-frame approach. Issues dealt with in single frames will almost by definition lead to unwanted and unforeseen effects elsewhere. \nOverall, diversity in the overall fiber mix is needed; in 2013 cotton and polyester accounted for almost 85% of all fibers, and thus their impacts were, and continue to be, disproportionately magnified. Also, many fibers in the finished garments are mixed to acquire desired drape, flexibility or stretch, thus affecting both care and the possibility to recycle the material in the end.\nNatural fibers are fibers which are found in  and are not petroleum-based. Natural fibers can be categorized into two main groups,  or  and  or . Uses of these fibers can be anything from buttons to eyewear such as sunglasses.\nOther than cotton, the most common plant-based fiber,  fibers include: , , , , ,  (used for ), , , , ,  (used for ). Alternative fibers such as bamboo (in yarn) and hemp (of a variety that produces only a tiny amount of the psychoactive component found in cannabis) are coming into greater use in so-called eco-fashions.\nCotton, also known as vegetable wool, is a major source of apparel fiber. Celebrated for its excellent absorbency, durability, and intrinsic softness, cotton accounts for over 50% of all clothing produced worldwide. This makes cotton the most widely used clothing fiber.  is one of the most chemical-intensive crops in the world. Conventionally grown cotton uses approximately 25% of the world's  and more than 10% of the world's . However, growing and processing this particular fiber crop is largely unsustainable. For every pound of cotton harvested, a farmer uses up 1/3\u00a0lb of chemical, synthetic fertilizer.  As a whole, the US cotton production makes up 25% of all pesticides deployed in the United States. Worldwide, cotton takes up 2.4% of all arable lands yet requires 16% of the world's pesticides.  Furthermore, the cotton hulls contain the most potent insecticide residues. They are often used as cattle feed, which means that consumers are purchasing meat containing a concentration of pesticides. The processing of cotton into usable fibers also adds to the burden on the environment. Manufacturers prefer cotton to be white so that cotton can easily be synthetically dyed to any shade of color. Natural cotton is actual beige brown, and so during processing, manufacturers would add bleach and various other chemicals and heavy metal dyes to make cotton pure white.  resins would be added in as well to form \"easy care\" cotton fabric.\nTo reduce the use of pesticides and other harmful chemicals, companies have produced  (GMO) cottons plants that are resistant to pest infestations. Among the GMO are cotton crops inserted with the Bt () gene.  crops do not require insecticide applications. Insects that consume cotton containing Bt will stop feeding after a few hours, and die, leaving the cotton plants unharmed.\nAs a result of the use of Bt cotton, the cost of pesticide applications decreased between $25 and $65 per acre.  Bt cotton crops yield 5% more cotton on average compared to traditional cotton crops.  Bt crops also lower the price of cotton by 0.8\u00a0cents per pound.\nHowever, there are concerns regarding Bt technology, mainly that insects will eventually develop resistance to the Bt strain. According to an article published in Science Daily, researchers have found that members from a cotton bollworm species, , were Bt resistant in some crop areas of Mississippi and Arkansas during 2003 and 2006. Fortunately, the vast majority of other agricultural pests remain susceptible to Bt.\nMicha Peled's documentary expos\u00e9  on BT farming in  reveals the true impact of genetically modified cotton on India's farmers, with a suicide rate of over a quarter million Bt cotton farmers since 1995 due to financial stress resulting from massive crop failure and the exorbitantly high price of Monsanto's proprietary BT seed.  The film also refutes false claims purported by the biotech industry that Bt cotton requires less pesticide and empty promises of higher yields, as farmers discover the bitter truth that in reality Bt cotton in fact requires a great deal more pesticide than organic cotton, and often suffer higher levels of infestation by  resulting in devastating crop losses, and extreme financial and psychological stress on cotton farmers.  Due to the biotech seed monopoly in India, where Bt cotton seed has become the ubiquitous standard, and organic seed has become absolutely unobtainable, thus coercing all cotton farmers into signing Bt cotton seed purchase agreements which enforce the intellectual property interests of the biotech  .\n\nOrganic cotton is grown without the use of any genetically modification to the crops, without the use of any fertilizers, pesticides, and other synthetic agro-chemicals harmful to the land. All cotton marketed as organic in the United States is required to fulfill strict federal regulations regarding how the cotton is grown. This is done with a combination of innovation, science and tradition in order to encourage a good quality of life and environment for all involved.  Organic cotton uses 88% less water and 62% less energy than conventional cotton.  Organic Cotton\n\nCotton is naturally grown in varieties of colors. Typically, cotton color can come as mauve, red, yellow, and orange hues. The use of naturally colored cotton has long been historically suppressed, mainly due to the industrial revolution.  Back then, it was much cheaper to have uniformly white cotton as a raw source for mass-producing cloth and fabric items.  Currently, modern markets have revived a trend in using naturally colored cotton for its noted relevance in reducing harmful environmental impacts. One such example of markets opening to these cotton types would be Sally Fox and her Foxfiber business\u2014naturally colored cotton that Fox has bred and marketed.  On an additional note, naturally colored cotton is already colored, and thus do not require synthetic dyes during process. Furthermore, the color of fabrics made from naturally colored cotton does not become worn and fade away compared to synthetically dyed cotton fabrics.\n\nSoy fabrics are derived from the hulls of soybeans\u2014a manufacturing byproduct. Soy fabrics can be blended (i.e. 30%) or made entirely out of soy fibers. Soy clothing is largely , so it has a minimal impact on environment and . Although not as durable as cotton or hemp fabrics, soy clothing has a soft, elastic feel.  Soy clothing is known as the vegetable  for its light and silky sensation. Soy fabrics are moisture absorbent, anti-bacterial, and UV resistant. However, soy fabrics fell out of public knowledge during World War II, when , , and cotton sales rose sharply.Soybean Plant\nHemp, like bamboo, is considered a sustainable crop. It requires little water to grow, and it is resistant to most pests and diseases. The hemp plant's broad leaves shade out weeds and other plant competitors, and its deep taproot system allows it to draw moisture deep in the soil.  Unlike cotton, many parts of the hemp plant have a use. Hemp seeds, for example, are processed into oil or food.  Hemp fiber comes in two types: primary and secondary . Hemp fibers are durable and are considered strong enough for construction uses. Compared to cotton fiber, hemp fiber is approximately 8 times the tensile strength and 4 times the durability.\n\nHemp fibers are traditionally coarse, and have been historically used for ropes rather than for clothing. However, modern technology and breeding practices have made hemp fiber more pliable, softer, and finer.Fibers from a Hemp plant.\n\nBamboo fabrics are made from heavily pulped bamboo grass.  Making clothing and textile from bamboo is considered sustainable due to the lack of need for pesticides and agrochemicals.  Naturally disease and pest resistant, bamboo is also fast growing. Compared to trees, certain varieties of bamboo can grow 1\u20134\u00a0inches long per day, and can even branch and expand outward because of its underground rhizomes. Like cotton fibers, bamboo fibers are naturally yellowish in color and are bleached white with chemicals during processing.\nBurnished by a grant from the , associate professor Young-A Lee and her team are growing vats of gel-like film composed of  fiber, a byproduct of the same symbiotic colonies of bacteria and yeast (abbreviated ) found in another of the world's popular \"live culture\" foods: . Once harvested and dried, the resulting material has a look and feel much like leather. The fibres are 100 percent , they also foster a  cycle of reuse and regeneration that leaves behind virtually zero waste. However, this material takes a long time to grow about three to four weeks under lab-controlled conditions. Hence mass production is an issue. In addition, tests revealed that moisture absorption from the air softens this material makes it less durable. Researchers also discovered that cold conditions make it brittle.\nS.Caf\u00e9 technology involves  used ground  into . A piece of S.Caf\u00e9 fabric is made with less energy in the process and is able to mask body odour. In addition, S.Caf\u00e9 yarn offers 200% faster drying time compared to conventional , with the ability to save energy in the process.\nS. Caf\u00e9 coffee grounds come with numerous microscopic pores, which create a long-lasting natural and chemical free shield for  or fiber, reflecting  and provide a comfortable outdoor experience.\nOther alternative biodegradable fibers being developed by small companies include:\nProtein fibers originate from animal sources and are made up of protein molecules. The basic elements in these protein molecules being carbon, hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen. Natural protein fibers include: , , , , , , , , and .\nJust as in cotton production, pesticides are used in the cultivation of wool, although quantities are considerably smaller and it is thought that good practice can significantly limit any negative environmental impact. Sheep are treated either with injectable insecticides, a pour-on preparation or dipped in a pesticide bath to control parasite infection, which if left untreated can have serious welfare implications for the flock. When managed badly, these pesticides can cause harm to human health and watercourses both on the farm and in subsequent downstream processing. \nMost commercially produced silk is of the cultivated variety and involves feeding the worms a carefully controlled diet of mulberry leaves grown under special conditions. Selected mulberry trees are grown to act as homes for the silkworms. The fibers are extracted by steaming to kill the silk moth chrysalis and then washed in hot water to degum the silk. \nItalian company Zero Grado Espace has developed MuSkin, an alternative to  made from the cap of the  mushroom, a parasitic fungus that grows in subtropical forests. It is water repellent and contains natural  substances which limit  proliferation.\nWild Rubber, developed by Flavia Amadeu and Professor Floriano Pastore at the University of Brazil, is an initiative that promotes wild rubber material which comes from the  or  of the  that grows within a biodiverse ecosystem in the , Acre, Brazil. It is tapped by local communities who typically have a close relationship the forest and will gather medicinal plants or wild food during their tapping rounds.\nQmilch GmbH, a German company has innovated a process to produce a  fiber from  in milk but it cannot be used for consumption. Qmilk fiber is made from 100%  resources. In addition, for the production of 1 kg of fiber Qmilch GmbH needs only 5 minutes and max. 2 liters of water. This implies a particular level of cost efficiency and ensures a minimum of  emissions. Qmilk fiber is  and leaves no traces. In addition, it is naturally antibacterial, especially against the bacterial strains,  and  and is ideal for people that suffer from textile allergies.\nFabrics made from Qmilk fiber provide high wearing comfort and a silky feel. The organic fiber is tested for harmful substances and dermatologically tested for the wearer's skin and body compatibility 0% chemical additives.\nManufactured fibers sit within three categories: Manufactured cellulosic fibers, manufactured synthetic fibers and manufactured protein fiber (azlon). Manufactured cellulosic fibers include modal,  (also known under the brand name Tencel), rayon/viscose made from bamboo, rayon/viscose made from wood and  (PLA). Manufactured synthetic fibers include , , , ,  and  (PP).  is a manufactured protein fiber.\n\nPET plastics are also known as (PETE). PET's , the number within the three chasing arrows, is one. These plastics are usually beverage bottles (i.e. water, soda, and fruit juice bottles). According to the , plastic accounts for 12% of the total amount of waste we produce. Recycling plastic reduces air, water, and ground pollution. Recycling is only the first step; investing and purchasing products manufactured from recycled materials is the next of many steps to living sustainably.Recyclables at transfer station, Gainesville, FL.\nClothing can be made from plastics. Seventy percent of plastic-derived fabrics come from polyester, and the type of polyester most used in fabrics is  (PET).  PET plastic clothing come from reused plastics, often recycled plastic bottles. The  Company, for example, created a \"Drink2Wear\" line of T-shirts made from recycled bottles. Generally, PET plastic clothing are made from recycled bottles as follows: plastic bottles are collected, compressed, baled, and shipped into processing facilities where they will be chopped into flakes, and melted into small white pellets. Then, the pellets are processed again, and spun into yarn-like fiber where it can be made into clothing. One main benefit of making clothes from recycled bottles is that it keep the bottles and other plastics from occupying landfill space. Another benefit is that it takes 30% less energy to make clothes from recycled plastics than from virgin polyesters.Whereas many producers have since the turn of the century been striving for a cradle-to-cradle model of production, or a circular economy, there has so far been no successful example of fully sustainable production, as there is environmental impact from all extractive production practices (in processes of material production, dying, assembly, accessorizing, shipping, retail, washing, recycling etc.) There are  many small initiatives towards change, yet so far all these incremental improvements have been drowned by the explosive popularity of \"fast\" fashion and its economy of extraction, consumption, waste.\nThe global political economy and legal system supports a fashion system that enables fashion that has devastating environmental, social, cultural and economic impacts to be priced at a lower price than fashion which involves efforts to minimize harm in the growth, manufacturing, and shipping of the products. This results in higher prices for fashion made from reduced impact materials than clothing produced in a socially and environmentally damaging way (sometimes referred to as conventional methods).\n\nInnovative fashion is being developed and made available to consumers at different levels of the fashion spectrum, from casual clothing to  which has a reduced social and environmental impact at the materials and manufacture stages of production and celebrities, models, and designers have recently drawn attention to socially conscious and environmentally friendly fashion. is a technology that allows an entire garment to be knit with no seams. This production method is considered a sustainable practice due to its reduction in waste and labor. By only using the necessary materials, the producers will be more efficient in their manufacturing process. This production method is similar to seamless knitting, although traditional seamless knitting requires stitching to complete the garment while 3D seamless knitting creates the entire garment, eliminating additional work. The garments are designed using 3D software unlike traditional flat patterns. Shima Seiki and Stoll are currently the two primary manufacturers of the technology. The technology is produced through the use of solar energy and they are selling to brands like Max Mara.\n design is a concept that, although has been prevalent for many years, is increasingly being integrated into production. Zero-waste design is used through multiple industries but is very applicable in developing patterns for garments. The concept of  is designing the pattern for a garment so that when the textile is cut, there is no extra fabric going to waste. This means the pattern pieces for a garment fit together like puzzle pieces in order to use the entire amount of fabric provided, creating no waste in this step of production.\nTraditional methods of dyeing textiles are incredibly harmful towards the earth's water supply, creating toxic chemicals that effect entire communities. An alternative to traditional water dyeing is scCO2 dyeing (super critical carbon dioxide). This process creates no waste by using 100% of the dyes, reducing energy by 60% with no auxiliary chemicals, and leaving a quarter of the physical footprint of traditional dyeing. Different names for this process are Drydye and Colordry. Another company called Colorep has patented Airdye, a similar process that they claim uses 95% less water and up to 86% less energy than traditional dyeing methods.\nSo far, no brand can label itself as fully sustainable, and controversies are abundant on exactly how to use the concept in relation to fashion, if it can be used at all, or if labels such \"slow\" and \"sustainable\" fashion are inherently an oxymoron. Brands that sell themselves as sustainable often still lack systems to deal with oversupply, take back used clothes, fully recycle fibers, offer repair services, or even support the life of the garment during use (such as instructions on washing, care and repair). Almost no brands offer spare parts, which says a lot about the general life expectancy of garments in general: brand are not supporting consumers to make garments last.\nThat said, some  (such as Rank A Brand, Good On You, ...) exist which compare fashion brands on their sustainability record, and these can at least give an indication to consumers.\nThere are much ecolabels in existence which focus on textile.\nSome notable ecolabels include:\nSome brands that sell themselves as sustainable are listed below;\nThere is no certain stable model among the designers for how to be sustainable in practice, and the understanding of sustainability is always a process or a work-in-progress, and varies by who defines what is \"sustainable;\" farmers or animals, producers or consumers, managers or workers, local businesses or neighborhoods. Thus critical scholars would label much of the business-driven discourse on sustainability as \"greenwashing\" as under the current economic paradigm, \"sustainability\" is primarily defined as keeping the wheels of perpetual production and consumption turning; to keep the \"perpetuum mobile\" of fashion running and in .\nThere are some designers that experiment in making fashion more sustainable, with various degrees of impact;\nA question at the foundation of sustainable fashion concerns exactly what is to be \"sustained\" of the current model of fashion. Controversies thus emerge what stakeholder agendas should be prioritized over others.\nA major controversy on sustainable fashion concerns how the \"green\" imperative is used as a cover-up for systemic labor exploitation, social exclusion and environmental degradation, what is generally labelled as . Market-driven sustainability can only address sustainability to a certain degree as brands still need to sell more products in order to be profitable. Thus almost any initiative towards addressing ecological and social issues still contributes to the damage. In a 2017 report, the industry projects that the overall apparel consumption will rise by 63%, from 62 million tons today to 102 million tons in 2030, thus effectively erasing any environmental gains made by current initiatives. As long as the business models of fashion brands are based on growth as well as production and sales of high quantities of garment, almost all initiatives from the industry remains labelled as greenwashing.\nThough  is considered a more sustainable choice for fabric, as it uses fewer  and , it remains less than 1% global cotton production. Hurdles to growth include cost of hand labor for hand weeding, reduced yields in comparison to conventional cotton and absence of fiber commitments from brands to farmers before planting seed. The up front financial risks and costs are therefore shouldered by the farmers, many of whom struggle to compete with economies of scale of corporate farms.\nThough some designers have marketed , as an alternative to conventional cotton, citing that it absorbs greenhouse gases during its life cycle and grows quickly and plentifully without pesticides, the conversion of bamboo fiber to fabric is the same as rayon and is highly toxic. The FTC ruled that labeling of bamboo fiber should read \"rayon from bamboo\". Bamboo fabric can cause environmental harm in production due to the chemicals used to create a soft viscose from hard bamboo. Impacts regarding production of new materials make recycled, reclaimed, surplus, and vintage fabric arguably the most sustainable choice, as the raw material requires no agriculture and no manufacturing to produce. However, it must be noted that these are indicative of a system of production and consumption that creates excessive volumes of waste.\nUsed clothing is sold in more than 100 countries. In Tanzania, used clothing is sold at the   (Swahili for \"secondhand\") markets. Most of the clothing is imported from the United States. However, there are concerns that trade in secondhand clothing in African countries decreases development of local industries even as it creates employment in these countries. While the reuse of materials brings resource savings, there are some concerns that the influx of cheap, second-hand clothing, particularly in Africa, has undermined indigenous textile industries. With the result that clothing collected in the West under the guise of 'charitable donations' could actually create more poverty.  And the authors of  warn that in the long run, as prices and quality of new clothing continue to decline, the demand for used clothing will also diminish.\nThe increase in western consumers\u2019 environmental interest is motivating companies to use sustainable and environmental arguments solely to increase sales. Because environmental and sustainability issues are complex, it is also easy to mislead consumers. Companies can use sustainability as a \u201cmarketing ploy\u201d something that can be seen as . Greenwashing is the deceptive use of an eco-agenda in marketing strategies. It refers mostly to corporations that make efforts to clean up their reputation because of social pressure or for the purpose of financial gain.\nIn the European Union, the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) regulations required in 2007 that clothing manufacturers and importers identified and quantified the chemicals used in their products.\nOn May 3, 2012, the world's largest summit on fashion sustainability was held in Copenhagen, gathering more than 1,000 key stakeholders in the industry to discuss the importance of making the fashion industry sustainable. Copenhagen Fashion Summit has since then gathered thousands of people from the fashion industry in their effort to create a movement within the industry.\nIn July 2012, the Sustainable Apparel Coalition launched the , a self-assessment standard designed to measure and promote sustainable supply chains in the apparel and footwear industries. Founded in 2011, the Sustainable Apparel Coalition is a nonprofit organisation whose members include brands producing apparel or footwear, retailers, industry affiliates and trade associations, the , academic institutions and environmental nonprofits.\nThe Global Change Award, is an innovation challenge created by the H&M foundation. It created a trend report in 2017 to look at the future of sustainable fashion.  Five \"megatrends\" are identified by the organisation that will lead the future of sustainable fashion.  The first \"megatrend\" is \"Power of Nature\" which is the industry looking into materials that have always been looked at as waste as a more sustainable method to making new clothing. The materials that will mitigate negative impacts from the industry include vegan materials from the earth and recycling old fabric into new clothing.  The second \"megatrend\" is \"Rent a Closet\"; this initiative has been around for a while. This trend ultimately lowers the new purchase of clothing and disposal of clothing, which means less waste.   is an example of the \"Rent a Closet\" trend.  Rent the Runway started as a company that would give luxury brands like , ,  to people who may not be able to afford the clothing at regular retail price.  Renting and sharing clothing is also known as CFC (collaborative fashion consumption) a sustainable fashion trend consumers are getting involved in.  The third trend is \"Long Live Fashion\" is the revival of . Vintage clothing is a way to lower the amount of clothing that gets disposed of and ends up in landfills.  Companies like RE/DONE, Vintage Twin and Frankie Collective sell re-paired vintage clothing. Repairing and reselling clothing has less negative impact than creating new clothing does.   The fourth megatrend is  \"innovative recycling\" which is looking at waste as value.  The industry is starting to create incentives for consumers to participate in the recycling of clothing.\nTailored couture is one option for the future of a greener fashion industry as it can potentially lead to less waste and more jobs improving the economy. Tailored couture is no longer desired because of the convenience of malls and stores provide but the consequence of the convenience is the pollution of the environment. Tailored clothing if it were to become the norm mass production of clothing that will not be bought can be reduced and reusing and redesigning old clothes to fit could reduce the amount of old worn out unfitting clothes thrown out or given away.\n\nIn 2019, the UK Parliament's Environment Audit Committee published a report and recommendations on the future of fashion sustainability, suggesting wide-ranging systemic change, not least government regulation and tax-incentives for sustainable practices, such as lowered VAT for repair services. As highlighted in the report, wide political and social changes are needed to push industry towards more sustainable practices and levels of consumption: brands doing \"less harm\" is not enough. The report finishes with the following statement;\"Retailers must take responsibility for the social and environmental cost of clothes. They should use their market power to demand higher environmental and labour standards from suppliers. Offering rental schemes, lifetime repair and providing the consumer with more information about the sourcing and true cost of clothing are all measures that can be more widely adopted. Shifting business practice in this way can not only improve a business\u2019s environmental and social impact but also offer market advantage as they respond to the growing consumer demand for responsible, sustainable clothing.\"(p.54)In 2020, the first ranking of the Top Global Fashion Capitals for Sustainability  was released by the Global Language Monitor , which has been ranking the top fashion capitals since 2007.  The purpose of the rankings is to recognize the efforts put forth by all manner of fashion capitals in contributing to the sustainability movement.\n\n"},
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_business", "title": "SustainablebusinessWikipedia", "body": "A , or a , is an enterprise that has minimal negative impact, or potentially a positive effect, on the global or local environment, community, society, or economy\u2014a  that strives to meet the . They cluster under different groupings and the whole is sometimes referred to as \"green capitalism\". Often, sustainable businesses have progressive environmental and  policies. In general,  is described as green if it matches the following four criteria:\nA sustainable business is any organization that participates in environmentally friendly or green activities to ensure that all processes, products, and manufacturing activities adequately address current environmental concerns while maintaining a profit. In other words, it is a business that \u201cmeets the needs of the present [world] without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\u201d It is the process of assessing how to design products that will take advantage of the current environmental situation and how well a company\u2019s products perform with renewable resources.\nThe  emphasized that sustainability is a three-legged stool of people, planet, and profit. Sustainable businesses with the supply chain try to balance all three through the triple-bottom-line concept\u2014using sustainable development and  to affect the environment, business growth, and the society.\nEveryone affects the  of the marketplace and the planet in some way. Sustainable development within a business can create value for customers, investors, and the environment. A sustainable business must meet customer needs while, at the same time, treating the environment well. To succeed in such an approach, where stakeholder balancing and joint solutions are key, requires a structural approach. One philosophy, that include many different tools and methods, is the concept of Sustainable Enterprise Excellence. Another is the adoption of the concept of responsible growth.\nSustainability is often confused with  (CSR), though the two are not the same. Bansal and DesJardine (2014) state that the notion of \u2018time\u2019 discriminates sustainability from CSR and other similar concepts.  Whereas ethics, morality, and norms permeate CSR, sustainability only obliges businesses to make intertemporal trade-offs to safeguard intergenerational equity. Short-termism is the bane of sustainability.\nGreen business has been seen as a possible mediator of economic-environmental relations, and if proliferated, would serve to diversify our economy, even if it has a negligible effect at lowering atmospheric CO levels. The definition of \"green jobs\" is ambiguous, but it is generally agreed that these jobs, the result of green business, should be linked to clean energy, and contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gases. These corporations can be seen as generators of not only \"green energy\", but as producers of new \"materialities\" that are the product of the technologies these firms developed and deployed.\nA major initiative of sustainable businesses is to eliminate or decrease the environmental harm caused by the production and consumption of their goods. The impact of such human activities in terms of the amount of greenhouse gases produced can be measured in units of carbon dioxide and is referred to as the . The carbon footprint concept is derived from ecological footprint analysis, which examines the ecological capacity required to support the consumption of products.\nBusinesses take a wide range of green initiatives. One of the most common examples is the act of \"going paperless\" or sending electronic correspondence in lieu of paper when possible. On a higher level, examples of sustainable business practices include:  (e.g., tuning up lightly used commercial fitness equipment for resale);  to eliminate waste (such as using a more accurate template to cut out designs); and choosing nontoxic raw materials and processes. For example, Canadian farmers have found that hemp is a sustainable alternative to rapeseed in their traditional ; hemp grown for fiber or seed requires no pesticides or herbicides.\nSustainable business leaders also take into account the  for the items they produce. Input costs must be considered in regards to regulations, energy use, storage, and disposal.  (DFE) is also an element of sustainable business. This process enables users to consider the potential environmental impacts of a product and the process used to make that product.\nThe many possibilities for adopting green practices have led to considerable pressure being put upon companies from consumers, employees, government regulators and other stakeholders. Some companies have resorted to  instead of making meaningful changes, merely marketing their products in ways that suggest green practices. For example, various producers in the bamboo fiber industry have been taken to court for advertising their products as more \"green\" than they are. Still, countless other companies have taken the sustainability trend seriously and are enjoying profits. In their book \u201cCorporate Sustainability in International Comparison\u201d, Schaltegger et al. (2014) analyse the current state of corporate sustainability management and corporate social responsibility across eleven countries. Their research is based on an extensive survey focusing on the companies\u2019 intention to pursue sustainability management (i.e. motivation; issues), the integration of sustainability in the organisation (i.e. connecting sustainability to the core business; involving corporate functions; using drivers of business cases for sustainability) and the actual implementation of sustainability management measures (i.e. stakeholder management; sustainability management tools and standards; measurements). The  written by Richard Seireeni, (2009), documents the experiences of sustainable businesses in America and their reliance on the vast but invisible green community, referred to as the , for support and a market.\nGreen investment firms are consequently attracting unprecedented interest. In the UK, for instance, the  is devoted exclusively to supporting renewable domestic energy. However, the UK and Europe as a whole are falling behind the impressive pace set by developing nations in terms of green development. Thus, green investment firms are creating more and more opportunities to support sustainable development practices in emerging economies. By providing  and larger investments, these firms assist small business owners in developing nations who seek business education, affordable loans, and new distribution networks for their \"green\" products.\nThe Harvard Business School business historian  has traced the historical origins of green business back to pioneering start-ups in organic food and wind and solar energy before World War 1. Among large corporations,  occupies an odd role in the story of sustainability. Ironically, founder  was a pioneer in the sustainable business realm, experimenting with plant-based fuels during the days of the Model T. Ford Motor Company also shipped the Model A truck in crates that then became the vehicle floorboards at the factory destination. This was a form of , retaining high quality in a closed-loop industrial cycle. Furthermore, the original auto body was made of a stronger-than-steel hemp composite. Today, of course, Fords aren't made of hemp nor do they run on the most sensible fuel. Currently, Ford's claim to eco-friendly fame is the use of seat fabric made from 100% post-industrial materials and renewable soy foam seat bases. Ford executives recently appointed the company\u2019s first senior vice president of sustainability, environment, and safety engineering. This position is responsible for establishing a long-range sustainability strategy and environmental policy. The person in this position will also help develop the products and processes necessary to satisfy both customers and society as a whole while working toward energy independence. It remains to be seen whether Ford will return to its founder's vision of a petroleum-free automobile, a vehicle powered by the remains of plant matter.\nThe automobile manufacturer  is a sustainability giant. In 2008 a Subaru assembly plant in Lafayette became the first auto manufacturer to achieve zero land fill status when the plant implemented sustainable policies. The company successfully managed to implement a plan that increased refuse recycling to 99.8%. In 2012, the corporation increased the reuse of Styrofoam by 9%. And from the year 2008 to the year 2012, environmental incidents and accidents reduced from 18 to 4.\nSmaller companies such as , an organic cereal and snack making business, have also made significant sustainability gains in the 21st century. CEO  and his associates have ensured that the quickly growing company's products are produced without toxic farm chemicals. Furthermore, employees are constantly encouraged to find ways to reduce consumption. Sustainability is an essential part of corporate discussions. Another example comes from , a company created in 1996 as a , , coffee producer. In recent years they have become , lowering emissions by reducing long-range trucking and using  in delivery trucks, upgrading to energy efficient equipment and purchasing . The company claims to offer the first carbon neutral coffee sold in Canada. Salt Spring Coffee was recognized by the  in the 2010 report . A third example comes from Korea, where rice husks are used as a nontoxic packaging for stereo components and other electronics. The same material is later recycled to make bricks.\nThe  and specifically  industries are also moving towards more sustainable practices, especially given that the industry is one of the most environmentally destructive. Indeed, regarding gold mining,  scientists have, in the laboratory, discovered an inexpensive and environmentally sustainable method that uses simple \u2014instead of \u2014to isolate gold from raw materials in a selective manner. Such a method will reduce the amount of  released into the environment during gold extraction from raw , with one of the  scientists, Sir Fraser Stoddart stating that: \u201cThe elimination of cyanide from the gold industry is of the utmost importance environmentally\". Additionally, the retail jewelry industry is now trying to be totally sustainable, with companies using green energy providers and  more, as well as preventing the use of mined-so called 'virgin gold' by applying re-finishing methods on pieces and re-selling them. Furthermore, the customer may opt for  Gold, which gives a better deal to small scale and  miners, and is an element of sustainable business. However, not all think that mining can be sustainable and much more must be done, noting that mining in general is in need of greater regional and international legislation and regulation, which is a valid point given the huge impact mining has on the planet and the huge number of products and goods that are made wholly or partly from  materials.\nOrganizations that give back to the community, whether through employees volunteering their time or through charitable donations are often considered . Organizations also can encourage education in their communities by training their employees and offering internships to younger members of the community. Practices such as these increase the education level and quality of life in the community.\nFor a business to be truly sustainable, it must sustain not only the necessary environmental resources, but also social resources\u2014including employees, customers (the community), and its reputation.\nThe European community\u2019s  restricts the use of certain hazardous materials in the production of various electronic and electrical products.  () directives provide collection, recycling, and recovery practices for electrical goods.  The  and the  are two organizations working together to set a standard for reporting on corporate .  From October 2013, all quoted companies in the UK are legally required to report their annual greenhouse gas emissions in their directors\u2019 report, under the  (Strategic and Directors\u2019 Reports) Regulations 2013.\n\u2019s  and \u2019s  provide information on sustainability initiatives.\nCorporate sustainability strategies can aim to take advantage of sustainable revenue opportunities, while protecting the value of business against increasing energy costs, the costs of meeting regulatory requirements, changes in the way customers perceive brands and products, and the volatile price of resources.\nNot all eco-strategies can be incorporated into a company's Eco-portfolio immediately. The widely practiced strategies include: Innovation, Collaboration, Process Improvement and Sustainability reporting. \nThis introverted method of sustainable corporate practices focuses on a company's ability to change its products and services towards less waste production and sustainable best practices.\nThe formation of networks with similar or partner companies facilitates knowledge sharing and propels innovation.\nContinuous process surveying and improvement is essential to reduction in waste. Employee awareness of company-wide sustainability plan further aids the integration of new and improved processes.\nPeriodic reporting of company performance in relation to goals. These goals are often incorporated into the corporate mission (as in the case of Ford Motor Co.).\nSustainable procurement is important for any sustainability strategy as a company's impact on the environment is much bigger than the products that they consume. The  model is a good example of one that encourages companies to focus on this.\nAdditionally, companies might consider implementing a sound measurement and management system with readjustment procedures, as well as a regular forum for all stakeholders to discuss sustainablity issues. The Sustainability Balanced Scorecard is a performance measurement and management system aiming at balancing financial and non-financial as well as short and long-term measures. It explicitly integrates strategically relevant environmental, social and ethical goals into the overall performance management system  and supports strategic sustainability management.\nEnormous economic and population growth worldwide in the second half of the twentieth century aggravated the factors that threaten health and the world \u2014 , , depletion, fouling of natural resources, and extensive  and . In the past, the standard approaches to environmental problems generated by business and industry have been regulatory-driven \"end-of-the-pipe\" remediation efforts. In the 1990s, efforts by governments, , corporations, and investors began to grow substantially to develop awareness and plans for investment in business sustainability.\nOne critical milestone was the establishment of the  standards whose development came as a result of the  held in 1992.  is the cornerstone standard of the  series. It specifies a framework of control for an Environmental Management System against which an organization can be certified by a third party. Other  Series Standards are actually guidelines, many to help you achieve registration to ISO 14001. They include the following:\nWhile the initial focus of academic, industry, and policy activities was mainly focused on the development of re-X (recycling, remanufacturing, reuse,...) technology, it soon became clear that the technological capabilities increasingly exceed their implementation. To leverage this technology for the transition towards a Circular Economy, different stakeholders have to work together. This shifted attention towards business model innovation as a key leverage for 'circular' technology adaption.\nCircular business models are business models that are closing, narrowing, slowing, intensifying, and dematerialising loops, to minimise the resource inputs into and the waste and emission leakage out of the organisational system. This comprises recycling measures (closing), efficiency improvements (narrowing), use phase extensions (slowing or extending), a more intense use phase (intensifying), and the substitution of product utility by service and software solutions (dematerialising).\nThe  standards were developed by the US Green Building Council in an effort to propel green building design in the United States. LEED certification is very prestigious title and can be attained through \"compliance with all environmental laws and regulations, occupancy scenarios, building permanence and pre-rating completion, site boundaries and area-to-site ratios, and obligatory five-year sharing of whole building energy and water use data from the start of occupancy (for new construction) or date of certification (for existing buildings)\".[15].\nImplementing sustainable business practices may have an effect on profits and a firm's financial 'bottom line'. At first blush, this challenge might make many corporate executives cringe. However, during a time where environmental awareness is popular, green strategies are likely to be embraced by employees, consumers, and other stakeholders. In fact, according to many studies, a positive correlation exists between environmental performance and economic performance.\nIf an organisation\u2019s current business model is inherently unsustainable, becoming a truly sustainable business requires a complete makeover of the business model (e.g. from selling cars to offering car sharing and other mobility services). This can present a major challenge due to the differences between the old and the new model and the respective skills, resources and infrastructure needed. A new business model can also offer major opportunities by entering or even creating new markets and reaching new customer groups.\nCompanies leading the way in sustainable business practices can be said to be taking advantage of sustainable revenue opportunities: according to the  the UK green economy to grow by 4.9 to 5.5 percent a year by 2015, and the average internal rate of return on energy efficiency investments for large businesses is 48%.  A 2013 survey suggests that demand for green products appears to be increasing: 27% of respondents said they are more likely to buy a sustainable product and/or service than 5 years ago. Furthermore, sustainable business practices may attract  and generate .\n"},

They also connect the rise of the concept of sustainability to the ending of the  in 1989 and the emergence of a new awareness of the global character of ecological and social problems. Sustainable art adopts, according to these authors, a critical position towards some key practitioners in the  movement of the 1960s, who showed little concern for the environmental consequences of treating the landscape like a giant canvas with a bulldozer for a brush. They have questioned the  division between 'autonomous' and 'instrumental' art originating with , arguing that it is 'autonomy that gives art, as well as artists as , the potential to be free and able to offer alternatives to dominant ideological paradigms.'\nSince 2005 there is a Sustainable Arts  running at  near Hamburg, Germany, curated by the German conceptional artist and curator Samuel J. Fleiner.\nThere are a range of interpretations over the relations between art and sustainability, besides the term 'sustainable art' promoted by Maja and Reuben Fowkes: Other authors prefer the broader notions of 'sustainability arts' or 'art and sustainability' (e.g.  and . Still others explicitly rejected the use of the term 'sustainable art', referring instead to 'artistic work that inspires us to think about sustainability\" ().\nProfessional discussion of the relationship of contemporary art to notions of sustainability blossomed across Europe in the early years 2000, with e.g. the conference of the German Society for Political Culture (Instituts f\u00fcr Kulturpolitik der Kulturpolitischen Gesellschaft e.V.), in January 2002 at the  of Berlin, and the 'Tutzinger Manifest'. An International  on Sustainability and Contemporary Art took place at , in Budapest (Hungary) in March 2006. This was the first in a series of international symposia organised by  bringing together contemporary artists, philosophers, environmental sciences and activists to explore common ground around issues such as 'Exit or Activism' (2008), 'Hard Realities and the New Materiality' (2009) and 'Art,  and Eco-Critique' (2010).. In March\u2013April 2007 at the , the Arts Research Network of the  focused its attention on the recent movements and approaches to 'arts and sustainability' at its biennial conference.\nKey texts in the emerging field of sustainable art include 'Kultur - Kunst - Nachhaltigkeit' (2002) by Hildegard Kurt and , \u2018The Principles of Sustainability in Contemporary Art\u2019 (2006) by Maja and Reuben Fowkes  and 'Art and Sustainability' (2011) by Sacha Kagan. A  collection of interdisciplinary analyses of the arts and cultures with relationship to sustainability is available in 'Sustainability: a new frontier for the arts and cultures' (2008) edited by Sacha Kagan and Volker Kirchberg.\nExhibitions devoted explicitly to \"sustainable art\" include e.g. \u2018Beyond Green: Towards a Sustainable Art\u2019 at the  in Chicago in November 2005.

Sustainable architecture uses a conscious approach to energy and ecological conservation in the design of the built environment.\nThe idea of sustainability, or , is to ensure that our use of presently available resources does not end up having detrimental effects to our collective well-being or making it impossible to obtain resources for other applications in the long run.\n over the entire life cycle of a building is the most important goal of sustainable architecture.  use many different passive and active techniques to reduce the energy needs of buildings and increase their ability to capture or generate their own energy. One of the keys to exploit local environmental resources and influence energy-related factors such as daylight, solar heat gains and ventilation is the use of .\nNumerous passive architectural strategies have been developed over time. Examples of such strategies include the arrangement of rooms or the sizing and orientation of windows in a building, and the orientation of facades and streets or the ratio between building heights and street widths for urban planning.\nAn important and  element of an efficient  system is a . A more efficient building requires less heat generating or dissipating power, but may require more ventilation capacity to expel .\nSignificant amounts of energy are flushed out of buildings in the water, air and  streams. , on-site energy recycling technologies can effectively recapture  hot water and stale air and transfer that energy into incoming fresh cold water or fresh air. Recapture of energy for uses other than gardening from compost leaving buildings requires centralized .\nHVAC systems are powered by motors. , versus other metal conductors, helps to improve the electrical energy efficiencies of motors, thereby enhancing the sustainability of electrical building components.\nSite and building orientation have some major effects on a building's HVAC efficiency.\n allows buildings to harness the energy of the sun efficiently without the use of any  mechanisms such as  or . Typically  building designs incorporate materials with high  that retain heat effectively and strong  that works to prevent heat escape. Low energy designs also requires the use of solar shading, by means of awnings, blinds or shutters, to relieve the solar heat gain in summer and to reduce the need for artificial cooling.  In addition,  typically have a very low surface area to volume ratio to minimize heat loss. This means that sprawling multi-winged building designs (often thought to look more \"organic\") are often avoided in favor of more centralized structures. Traditional cold climate buildings such as    designs provide a good historical model for centralized heat efficiency in a small-scale building.\nWindows are placed to maximize the input of heat-creating light while minimizing the loss of heat through glass, a poor insulator. In the  this usually involves installing a large number of south-facing windows to collect direct sun and severely restricting the number of north-facing windows. Certain window types, such as double or triple glazed  with gas filled spaces and  coatings, provide much better insulation than single-pane glass windows. Preventing excess solar gain by means of solar shading devices in the summer months is important to reduce cooling needs.   are often planted in front of windows to block excessive sun in summer with their leaves but allow light through in winter when their leaves fall off.  Louvers or light shelves are installed to allow the sunlight in during the winter (when the sun is lower in the sky) and keep it out in the summer (when the sun is high in the sky).   or  are often planted to the north of buildings to shield against cold north winds.\nIn colder climates, heating systems are a primary focus for sustainable architecture because they are typically one of the largest single energy drains in buildings.\nIn warmer climates where cooling is a primary concern, passive solar designs can also be very effective. Masonry  with  are very valuable for retaining the cool temperatures of night throughout the day. In addition builders often opt for sprawling single story structures in order to maximize surface area and heat loss. Buildings are often designed to capture and channel existing winds, particularly the especially cool winds coming from nearby . Many of these valuable strategies are employed in some way by the  of warm regions, such as south-western mission buildings.\nIn climates with four seasons, an integrated energy system will increase in efficiency: when the building is well insulated, when it is sited to work with the forces of nature, when heat is recaptured (to be used immediately or stored), when the heat plant relying on  or electricity is greater than 100% efficient, and when  is used.\n devices such as   help to provide sustainable electricity for any use. Electrical output of a solar panel is dependent on orientation, efficiency, latitude, and climate\u2014solar gain varies even at the same latitude. Typical efficiencies for commercially available PV panels range from 4% to 28%. The low efficiency of certain photovoltaic panels can significantly affect the payback period of their installation. This low efficiency does not mean that solar panels are not a viable energy alternative. In Germany for example, Solar Panels are commonly installed in residential home construction.\nRoofs are often angled toward the sun to allow photovoltaic panels to collect at maximum efficiency. In the northern hemisphere, a true-south facing orientation maximizes yield for solar panels. If true-south is not possible, solar panels can produce adequate energy if aligned within 30\u00b0 of south. However, at higher latitudes, winter energy yield will be significantly reduced for non-south orientation.\nTo maximize efficiency in winter, the collector can be angled above horizontal Latitude +15\u00b0. To maximize efficiency in summer, the angle should be Latitude -15\u00b0. However, for an annual maximum production, the angle of the panel above horizontal should be equal to its latitude.\nThe use of undersized wind turbines in energy production in sustainable structures requires the consideration of many factors. In considering costs, small wind systems are generally more expensive than larger wind turbines relative to the amount of energy they produce. For small wind turbines, maintenance costs can be a deciding factor at sites with marginal wind-harnessing capabilities. At low-wind sites, maintenance can consume much of a small wind turbine's revenue. Wind turbines begin operating when winds reach 8\u00a0mph, achieve energy production capacity at speeds of 32-37\u00a0mph, and shut off to avoid damage at speeds exceeding 55\u00a0mph. The energy potential of a wind turbine is proportional to the square of the length of its blades and to the cube of the speed at which its blades spin. Though wind turbines are available that can supplement power for a single building, because of these factors, the efficiency of the wind turbine depends much upon the wind conditions at the building site. For these reasons, for wind turbines to be at all efficient, they must be installed at locations that are known to receive a constant amount of wind (with average wind speeds of more than 15\u00a0mph), rather than locations that receive wind sporadically. A small wind turbine can be installed on a roof. Installation issues then include the strength of the roof, vibration, and the turbulence caused by the roof ledge. Small-scale rooftop wind turbines have been known to be able to generate power from 10% to up to 25% of the electricity required of a regular domestic household dwelling. Turbines for residential scale use are usually between 7 feet (2 m) to 25 feet (8 m) in diameter and produce electricity at a rate of 900 watts to 10,000 watts at their tested wind speed. Building integrated wind turbine performance can be enhanced with the addition of an aerofoil wing on top of a roof mounted turbine.\n, also called solar domestic hot water systems, can be a cost-effective way to generate hot water for a home. They can be used in any climate, and the fuel they use\u2014sunshine\u2014is free.\nThere are two types of solar water systems- active and passive. An active solar collector system can produce about 80 to 100 gallons of hot water per day. A passive system will have a lower capacity.\nThere are also two types of circulation, direct circulation systems and indirect circulation systems. Direct circulation systems loop the domestic water through the panels. They should not be used in climates with temperatures below freezing. Indirect circulation loops glycol or some other fluid through the solar panels and uses a heat exchanger to heat up the domestic water.\nThe two most common types of collector panels are Flat-Plate and Evacuated-tube. The two work similarly except that evacuated tubes do not convectively lose heat, which greatly improves their efficiency (5%-25% more efficient). With these higher efficiencies, Evacuated-tube solar collectors can also produce higher-temperature space heating, and even higher temperatures for absorption cooling systems.\nElectric-resistance water heaters that are common in homes today have an electrical demand around 4500\u00a0kW\u00b7h/year. With the use of solar collectors, the energy use is cut in half. The up-front cost of installing solar collectors is high, but with the annual energy savings, payback periods are relatively short.\nAir-source heat pumps (ASHP) can be thought of as reversible air conditioners. Like an air conditioner, an ASHP can take heat from a relatively cool space (e.g. a house at 70\u00a0\u00b0F) and dump it into a hot place (e.g. outside at 85\u00a0\u00b0F). However, unlike an air conditioner, the condenser and evaporator of an ASHP can switch roles and absorb heat from the cool outside air and dump it into a warm house.\nAir-source heat pumps are inexpensive relative to other heat pump systems. However, the efficiency of air-source heat pumps decline when the outdoor temperature is very cold or very hot; therefore, they are only really applicable in temperate climates.\nFor areas not located in temperate climates, ground-source (or geothermal) heat pumps provide an efficient alternative. The difference between the two heat pumps is that the ground-source has one of its heat exchangers placed underground\u2014usually in a horizontal or vertical arrangement. Ground-source takes advantage of the relatively constant, mild temperatures underground, which means their efficiencies can be much greater than that of an air-source heat pump. The in-ground heat exchanger generally needs a considerable amount of area. Designers have placed them in an open area next to the building or underneath a parking lot.\nEnergy Star ground-source heat pumps can be 40% to 60% more efficient than their air-source counterparts. They are also quieter and can also be applied to other functions like domestic hot water heating.\nIn terms of initial cost, the ground-source heat pump system costs about twice as much as a standard air-source heat pump to be installed. However, the up-front costs can be more than offset by the decrease in energy costs. The reduction in energy costs is especially apparent in areas with typically hot summers and cold winters.\nOther types of heat pumps are water-source and air-earth. If the building is located near a body of water, the pond or lake could be used as a heat source or sink. Air-earth heat pumps circulate the building's air through underground ducts. With higher fan power requirements and inefficient heat transfer, Air-earth heat pumps are generally not practical for major construction.\nSome examples of sustainable building materials include recycled  or blown-in fiber glass insulation, sustainably harvested wood, , , sheep wool,  (high and ultra high performance roman self-healing concrete), panels made from paper flakes, baked earth, rammed earth, clay, vermiculite, flax linnen, sisal, seagrass, expanded clay grains, coconut, wood fiber plates, calcium sandstone, locally obtained stone and rock, and , which is one of the strongest and fastest growing , and non-toxic low- glues and paints. Vegetative cover or shield over building envelopes also helps in the same. Paper which is fabricated or manufactured out of forest wood is supposedly hundred percent recyclable .thus it regenerates and saves almost all the forest wood that it takes during its manufacturing process.\nSustainable architecture often incorporates the use of recycled or second hand materials, such as  and . The reduction in use of new materials creates a corresponding reduction in  (energy used in the production of materials). Often sustainable architects attempt to retrofit old structures to serve new needs in order to avoid unnecessary development.  Architectural salvage and reclaimed materials are used when appropriate. When older buildings are demolished, frequently any good wood is reclaimed, renewed, and sold as flooring. Any good  is similarly reclaimed.  Many other parts are reused as well, such as doors, windows, mantels, and hardware, thus reducing the consumption of new goods.  When new materials are employed, green designers look for materials that are rapidly replenished, such as , which can be harvested for commercial use after only 6 years of growth,  or wheat straw, both of which are waste material that can be pressed into panels, or , in which only the outer bark is removed for use, thus preserving the tree.  When possible, building materials may be gleaned from the site itself; for example, if a new structure is being constructed in a wooded area, wood from the trees which were cut to make room for the building would be re-used as part of the building itself.\nLow-impact building materials are used wherever feasible: for example, insulation may be made from low VOC ()-emitting materials such as  or , rather than the  that may contain carcinogenic or toxic materials such as formaldehyde. To discourage insect damage, these alternate insulation materials may be treated with . Organic or milk-based paints may be used. However, a common fallacy is that \"green\" materials are always better for the health of occupants or the environment. Many harmful substances (including formaldehyde, arsenic, and asbestos) are naturally occurring and are not without their histories of use with the best of intentions. A study of emissions from materials by the State of California has shown that there are some green materials that have substantial emissions whereas some more \"traditional\" materials actually were lower emitters. Thus, the subject of emissions must be carefully investigated before concluding that natural materials are always the healthiest alternatives for occupants and for the Earth.\nVolatile organic compounds (VOC) can be found in any indoor environment coming from a variety of different sources. VOCs have a high vapor pressure and low water solubility, and are suspected of causing  type symptoms. This is because many VOCs have been known to cause sensory irritation and central nervous system symptoms characteristic to sick building syndrome, indoor concentrations of VOCs are higher than in the outdoor atmosphere, and when there are many VOCs present, they can cause additive and multiplicative effects.\nGreen products are usually considered to contain fewer VOCs and be better for human and environmental health.   A case study conducted by the Department of Civil, Architectural, and Environmental Engineering at the University of Miami that compared three green products and their non-green counterparts found that even though both the green products and the non-green counterparts both emitted levels of VOCs, the amount and intensity of the VOCs emitted from the green products were much safer and comfortable for human exposure.\nDespite the importance of materials to overall building sustainability, quantifying and evaluating the sustainability of building materials has proven difficult. There is little coherence in the measurement and assessment of materials sustainability attributes, resulting in a landscape today that is littered with hundreds of competing, inconsistent and often imprecise eco-labels,  and .  This discord has led both to confusion among consumers and commercial purchasers and to the incorporation of inconsistent sustainability criteria in larger building certification programs such as .  Various proposals have been made regarding rationalization of the standardization landscape for sustainable building materials.\nWaste takes the form of spent or useless materials generated from households and businesses, construction and demolition processes, and manufacturing and agricultural industries. These materials are loosely categorized as municipal solid waste, construction and demolition (C&D) debris, and industrial or agricultural by-products.  Sustainable architecture focuses on the on-site use of , incorporating things such as  systems for use on garden beds, and  to reduce sewage. These methods, when combined with on-site food waste composting and off-site recycling, can reduce a house's waste to a small amount of .\nOne central and often ignored aspect of sustainable architecture is building placement. Although the ideal environmental home or office structure is often envisioned as an isolated place, this kind of placement is usually detrimental to the environment. First, such structures often serve as the unknowing frontlines of . Second, they usually increase the  required for transportation and lead to unnecessary auto emissions. Ideally, most building should avoid suburban sprawl in favor of the kind of light  articulated by the  movement. Careful mixed use zoning can make commercial, residential, and light industrial areas more accessible for those traveling by foot, bicycle, or public transit, as proposed in the . The study of , in its holistic application, can also greatly help in proper building placement that minimizes energy consumption and works with the surroundings rather than against them, especially in rural and forested zones.\nA sustainable building consultant may be engaged early in the design process, to forecast the sustainability implications of , orientation, glazing and other physical factors, so as to identify a sustainable approach that meets the specific requirements of a project.\nNorms and standards have been formalized by performance-based rating systems e.g.  and  for homes. They define  to be met and provide  and testing to meet those benchmarks. It is up to the parties involved in the project to determine the best approach to meet those standards.\nCritics of the reductionism of modernism often noted the abandonment of the teaching of architectural history as a causal factor. The fact that a number of the major players in the shift away from modernism were trained at Princeton University's School of Architecture, where recourse to history continued to be a part of design training in the 1940s and 1950s, was significant. The increasing rise of interest in history had a profound impact on architectural education. History courses became more typical and regularized. With the demand for professors knowledgeable in the history of architecture, several PhD programs in schools of architecture arose in order to differentiate themselves from art history PhD programs, where architectural historians had previously trained. In the US,  and  were the first, created in the mid-1970s, followed by , , and . Among the founders of new architectural history programs were  at the Institute for the History of Architecture in Venice, Stanford Anderson and Henry Millon at MIT, Alexander Tzonis at the , Anthony Vidler at Princeton,  at the University of Venice,  at , and Werner Oechslin and Kurt Forster at .\nThe term \u201csustainability\u201d in relation to architecture has so far been mostly considered through the lens of building technology and its transformations. Going beyond the technical sphere of \u201cgreen\u201d design, invention and expertise, some scholars are starting to position architecture within a much broader cultural framework of the . Adopting this framework allows tracing a rich history of cultural debates about our relationship to nature and the environment, from the point of view of different historical and geographical contexts.\nConcurrently, the recent movements of  and  promote a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops ,  and . This in contrast to  and  architecture, as well as leaning against solitary  and . Both trends started in the 1980s. The  is an award that recognizes efforts in New Urbanism and New Classical Architecture, and is endowed with a prize money twice as high as that of the modernist .\n is used to help enable sustainable design by allowing architects and engineers to integrate and analyze building performance.[5]. BIM services, including conceptual and topographic modelling, offer a new channel to green building with successive and immediate availability of internally coherent, and trustworthy project information. BIM enables designers to quantify the environmental impacts of systems and materials to support the decisions needed to design sustainable buildings.\nThere are conflicting ethical, engineering, and political orientations depending on the viewpoints.\nThere is no doubt Green Technology has made its headway into the architectural community, the implementation of given technologies have changed the ways we see and perceive modern day architecture. While green architecture has been proven to show great improvements of ways of living both environmentally and technologically the question remains, is all this sustainable? Many building codes have been demeaned to international standards. \"LEED\" (Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design) has been criticized for exercising flexible codes for building to follow. Contractors do this to save as much money as they possibly can. For example, a building may have solar paneling but if the infrastructure of the building's core doesn't support that over a long period of time improvements would have to be made on a constant basis and the building itself would be vulnerable to disasters or enhancements. With companies cutting paths to make shortcuts with sustainable architecture when building their structures it fuels to the irony that the \"sustainable\" architecture isn't sustainable at all. Sustainability comes in reference to longevity and effectiveness.\nEthics and Politics also play into sustainable architecture and its ability to grow in urban environment. Conflicting viewpoints between engineering techniques and environmental impacts still are popular issues that resonate in the architectural community.

Though there are disagreements among those from different disciplines (and influenced by different political beliefs about the nature of the good society), these disciplines and international organizations have each offered measures or  of how to measure the concept.\nWhile sustainability indicators, indices and reporting systems gained growing popularity in both the public and private sectors, their effectiveness in influencing actual policy and practices often remains limited.\nVarious ways of operationalizing or measuring sustainability have been developed. During the last 10 years there has been an expansion of interest in SDI systems, both in industrialized and, albeit to a lesser extent, in . SDIs are seen as useful in a wide range of settings, by a wide range of actors: international and intergovernmental bodies; national governments and government departments; economic sectors; administrators of geographic or ecological regions; communities; nongovernmental organizations; and the private sector.\nSDI processes are underpinned and driven by the increasing need for improved quality and regularly produced information with better spatial and temporal resolution. Accompanying this need is the requirement, brought in part by the information revolution, to better differentiate between information that matters in any given policy context versus information that is of secondary importance or irrelevant.\nA large and still growing number of attempts to create aggregate measures of various aspects of sustainability created a stable of indices that provide a more nuanced perspective on development than economic aggregates such as GDP. Some of the most prominent of these include the  (HDI) of the United Nations Development Programme\u00a0(UNDP); the  of  and its partner organizations; the \u00a0(ESI) and the pilot \u00a0(EPI) reported under the \u00a0(WEF); or the \u00a0(GPI) calculated at the national or sub-national level. Parallel to these initiatives, political interest in producing a  that would take at least the cost of pollution and  depletion into account has grown, even if implementation is held back by the reluctance of policymakers and statistical services arising mostly from a concern about conceptual and technical challenges.\nAt the heart of the debate over different indicators are not only different disciplinary approaches but also different views of . Some indicators reflect the ideology of  and  that seek to define and measure progress on whether different countries or cultures agree to accept industrial technologies in their eco-systems.  Other approaches, like those that start from international treaties on cultural rights of indigenous peoples to maintain traditional cultures, measure the ability of those cultures to maintain their traditions within their eco-systems at whatever level of productivity they choose.\nThe Lempert-Nguyen indicator, devised in 2008 for practitioners, starts with the standards for sustainable development that have been agreed upon by the international community and then looks at whether intergovernmental organizations such as the UNDP and other development actors are applying these principles in their projects and work as a whole.\nIn using sustainability indicators, it is important to distinguish between three types of sustainability that are often mentioned in international development:\nThe following list is not exhaustive but contains the major points of view:\nUniversity of Maryland School of Public Policy professor and former Chief Economist for the World Bank Herman E. Daly (working from theory initially developed by Romanian economist  and laid out in his 1971 opus \"The Entropy Law and the Economic Process\") suggests the following three operational rules defining the condition of ecological (thermodynamic) sustainability:\nSome commentators have argued that the \"Daly Rules\", being based on  and the , should perhaps be considered implicit or foundational for the many other systems that are advocated, and are thus the most straightforward system for operationalization of the Bruntland Definition. In this view, the Bruntland Definition and the Daly Rules can be seen as complementary\u2014Bruntland provides the ethical goal of non-depletion of natural capital, Daly details parsimoniously how this ethic is operationalized in physical terms. The system is rationally complete, and in agreement with physical laws. Other definitions may thus be superfluous, or mere glosses on the immutable thermodynamic reality.\nThere are numerous other definitions and systems of operationalization for sustainability, and there has been competition for influence between them, with the unfortunate result that, in the minds of some observers at least, sustainability has no agreed-upon definition.\nFollowing the 's report, one of the first initiatives to bring scientific principles to the assessment of sustainability was by Swedish cancer scientist . Rob\u00e8rt coordinated a consensus process to define and operationalize sustainability. At the core of the process lies a consensus on what Rob\u00e8rt came to call the natural step framework. The framework is based on a definition of sustainability, described as  (as derived from ). In the natural step framework, a sustainable society does not systematically increase concentrations of , or ; that  and in which people have the \nEcological footprint accounting, based on the biological concept of , tracks the amount of land and water area a human population, needed to produce the resources the population consumes and to absorb its waste, under prevailing technology. This amount then is compared to available , in the world or in that region. The biocapacity represents the area able to regenerate resources and assimilate waste.  publishes every year results for all nations captured in UN statistics.\nThe algorithms of ecological footprint accounts have been used in combination with  the  methodology (S. Zhao, Z. Li and W. Li 2005), and a  has been derived from the latter. They have also been combined with a measure of , for instance through the \"\"\u00a0(HPI) calculated for 178 nations (Marks et al., 2006). The Happy Planet Index calculates how many happy life years each country is able to generate per  of ecological footprint.\nOne of the striking conclusions to emerge from ecological footprint accounting is that it would be necessary to have 4 or 5 back-up planets engaged in nothing but agriculture for all those alive today to live a western lifestyle. The Footprint analysis is closely related to the  equation that, itself, can be considered a metric.\nThough sustainable development has become a concept that biologists and ecologists have measured from an eco-system point of view and that the business community has measured from a perspective of energy and resource efficiencies and consumption, the discipline of  is itself founded on the concept of sustainability of human groups within ecological systems.  At the basis of the definition of  is whether a human group is able to transmit its values and continue several aspects of that lifestyle for at least three generations.  The measurement of culture, by anthropologists, is itself a measure of sustainability and it is also one that has been codified by international agreements and treaties like the  of 1992 and the   to maintain a cultural group's choice of lifestyles within their lands and ecosystems.\n, an organization of anthropologists and linguists working to protect  diversity, with a focus on language, has devised a sert of measures with  for measuring the survivability of languages and cultures in given eco-systems.\nThe Lempert\u2013Nguyen indicator of sustainable development, developed in 2008 by David Lempert and Hue Nhu Nguyen, is one that incorporates and integrates these cultural principles with international law.\nA number of agencies including the  Cities Programme,  and Metropolis have since 2010 begun using the  approach that sets up a four-domain framework for choosing appropriate indicators. Rather than designating the indicators that have to be used like most other approaches, it provides a framework to guide decision-making on what indicators are most useful. The framework is arranged around four domains - economics, ecology, politics and culture - which are then subdivided into seven analytically derived sub-domains for each domain. Indicators are linked to each sub-domain. By choosing culture as one of its key domains, the approach takes into account the emphasis of the 'Anthropological' approach (above), but retains a comprehensive sense of sustainability. The approach can be used to map any other sustainability indicator set. This is foundationally different from the Global Reporting Initiative Index (below) which uses a triple-bottom-line organizing framework, and is most relevant to corporate reporting.\nIn 1997 the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) was started as a multi-stakeholder process and independent institution whose mission has been \"to develop and disseminate globally applicable \". The GRI uses ecological footprint analysis and became independent in 2002. It is an official collaborating centre of the  (UNEP) and during the tenure of , it cooperated with the 's Global Compact.\nIn 1956 Dr.  of the University of Florida coined the term  and devised the accounting system of embodied energy.\nIn 1997,  M.T. Brown and S. Ulgiati published their formulation of a quantitative Sustainability Index (SI) as a ratio of the  (spelled with an \"m\", i.e. \"\", not simply \"energy\") yield ratio (EYR) to the environmental loading ratio (ELR). Brown and Ulgiati also called the sustainability index the \"Emergy Sustainability Index\" (ESI), \"an index that accounts for yield, renewability, and environmental load. It is the incremental emergy yield compared to the environmental load\".\nWriters like Leone (2005) and Yi et al. have also recently suggested that the emergy sustainability index has significant utility. In particular, Leone notes that while the GRI measures behavior, it fails to calculate supply constraints the emergy methodology aims to calculate.\nIn 2004, a joint initiative of the  (YCELP) and the  (CIESIN) of , in collaboration with the  and the  also attempted to construct an Environmental Sustainability Index\u00a0(ESI). \nThis was formally released in , Switzerland, at the annual meeting of the  (WEF) on 28 January 2005. The report on this index made a comparison of the WEF ESI to other sustainability indicators such as the  Index. However, there was no mention of the emergy sustainability index.\nIn 1996 the  (IISD) developed a , which proposed that a sustainability index \"...would give decision-makers tools to rate policies and programs against each other\" (1996, p.\u00a09). Ravi Jain (2005) argued that, \"The ability to analyze different alternatives or to assess progress towards sustainability will then depend on establishing measurable entities or metrics used for sustainability.\"\nThe  has produced a \"\",  \"a free, non-commercial software package that illustrates the complex relationships among economic, social and environmental issues\". This is based on  Prepared for the United Nations Division for Sustainable Development (UN-DSD)DECEMBER 2005.\nThe  (WBCSD), founded in 1995, has formulated the business case for sustainable development and argues that \"sustainable development is good for  and business is good for sustainable development\". This view is also maintained by proponents of the concept of . The theory of industrial ecology declares that  should be viewed as a series of interlocking man-made ecosystems interfacing with the natural .\nAccording to some economists, it is possible for the concepts of sustainable development and competitiveness to merge if enacted wisely, so that there is not an inevitable trade-off. This merger is motivated by the following six observations (Hargroves & Smith 2005):\nLife-cycle assessment is a \"composite measure of sustainability.\" It analyses the environmental performance of products and services through all phases of their life cycle: extracting and processing raw materials; manufacturing, transportation and distribution; use, re-use, maintenance; recycling, and final disposal.\nBuilding on the work of the , businesses began to see the needs of environmental and social systems as opportunities for business development and contribution to stakeholder value.  This approach has manifested itself in three key areas of strategic intent: 'sustainable innovation', , and '' business strategies. Now, as businesses have begun the shift toward sustainable enterprise, many business schools are leading the research and education of the next generation of business leaders.  Companies have introduced key development indicators to set targets and track progress on sustainable development. Some key players are:\nAnother application of the term sustainability has been in the Sustainable Livelihoods Approach, developed from conceptual work by , and the UK's Institute for Development Studies. This was championed by the UK's (DFID), ,  (FAO) as well as  such as ,  and the African Institute for Community-Driven Development, Khanya-aicdd. Key concepts include the Sustainable Livelihoods (SL) Framework, a holistic way of understanding livelihoods, the SL principles, as well as six governance issues developed by Khanya-aicdd. A wide range of information resources on Sustainable Livelihoods Approaches can be found at Livelihoods Connect.\nSome analysts view this measure with caution because they believe that it has a tendency to take one part of the footprint analysis and I\u00a0=\u00a0PAT equation (productivity) and to focus on the sustainability of economic returns to an economic sector rather than on the sustainability of the entire population or culture.\nThe United Nations \u00a0(FAO) has identified considerations for technical cooperation that affect three types of sustainability:\nSome ecologists have emphasised a fourth type of sustainability:\nSustainability is relevant to international development projects. One definition of development sustainability is \"the continuation of benefits after major assistance from the donor has been completed\" (Australian Agency for International Development 2000). Ensuring that development projects are sustainable can reduce the likelihood of them collapsing after they have just finished; it also reduces the financial cost of development projects and the subsequent social problems, such as dependence of the stakeholders on external donors and their resources. All development assistance, apart from temporary emergency and humanitarian relief efforts, should be designed and implemented with the aim of achieving sustainable benefits. There are ten key factors that influence development sustainability.\nThe definition of sustainability as \"the continuation of benefits after major assistance from the donor has been completed\" (Australian Agency for International Development 2000) is echoed by other definitions (World Bank, USAID). The concept has however evolved as it has become of interest to non grant-making institutions. Sustainability in development refers to  and  increases in local capacity and performance while foreign assistance decreases or shifts (not necessarily disappears). The objective of sustainable development is open to various interpretations.\n"},
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability_standards_and_certification", "title": "SustainabilitystandardsandcertificationWikipedia", "body": " are voluntary, usually third party-assessed, norms and standards relating to environmental such as IFGICT Standard, social, ethical and food safety issues, adopted by companies to demonstrate the performance of their organizations or products in specific areas.  There are over 400 such standards across the world. The trend started in the late 1980s and 90s with the introduction of  and standards for  and other products.  Most standards refer to the  of environmental quality, social equity, and economic prosperity. A standard is normally developed by a broad range of stakeholders and experts in a particular sector and includes a set of practices or criteria for how a crop should be sustainably grown or a resource should be ethically harvested. This might cover, for instance, responsible fishing practices that don't endanger marine biodiversity, or respect for human rights and the payment of fair wages on a coffee or tea plantation. Normally sustainability standards are accompanied by a verification process - often referred to as \"certification\" - to evaluate that an enterprise complies with a standard, as well as a traceability process for certified products to be sold along the supply chain, often resulting in a consumer-facing label. Certification programmes also focus on capacity building and working with partners and other organisations to support smallholders or disadvantaged producers to make the social and environmental improvements needed to meet the standard.\nThe basic premise of sustainability standards is twofold.  Firstly, they emerged in areas where national and global legislation was weak but where the consumer and  movements around the globe demanded action.  For example, campaigns by Global Exchange and other NGOs against the purchase of goods from \u201c\u201d factories by the likes of ,  and other leading brands led to the emergence of social welfare standards like the  and others.  Secondly, leading brands selling to both consumers and to the  supply chain may wish to demonstrate the environmental or organic merits of their products, which has led to the emergence of hundreds of ecolabels, organic and other standards.  A leading example of a consumer standard is the  movement, administered by  and exhibiting huge sales growth around the world for ethically sourced produce.  An example of a  standard which has grown tremendously in the last few years is the \u2019s standard (FSC) for forest products made from sustainable harvested trees.\nHowever, the line between consumer and B2B sustainability standards is becoming blurred, with leading trade buyers increasingly demanding Fairtrade certification, for example, and consumers increasingly recognizing the FSC mark. In recent years, the business-to-business focus of sustainability standards has risen as it has become clear that consumer demand alone cannot drive the transformation of major sectors and industries. In commodities such as palm oil, soy, farmed seafood, and sugar, certification initiatives are targeting the mainstream adoption of better practices and  industry collaboration. Major brands and retailers are also starting to make commitments to certification in their whole supply chain or product offering, rather than a single product line or ingredient .\nWith the growth of standards and certification as the major tool for global production and trade to become more sustainable and for the private sector to demonstrate sustainability leadership, it is essential that there are ways to assess the legitimacy and performance of different initiatives. Company and government buyers, as well as NGOs and civil society groups committed to sustainable production, need clarity on which standards and ecolabels are delivering  social, environmental and economic results. The  has emerged as the authority on good practice for sustainability standards and its Codes of Good Practice represent the most widely recognised guidance on how standards should be set up and implemented in order to be effective. By complying with these Codes and working with other certification initiatives, ISEAL members demonstrate their credibility and work towards improving their positive impacts.\nAttempts to address the problems caused by a multiplicity of certification initiatives led to the launch of  project, facilitated by the  (UNCTAD) and the  (IISD) under the auspices of the Sustainable Commodity Initiative (SCI).\nMany of the international standards developed to help guide sustainability goals and certification schemes originate from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).  The FAO has promulgated a number of standards for certifying bodies to adhere to.  In particular, the FAO has issued guidelines and standards designed to make agriculture, fisheries, and forestry more sustainable.   of the sustainability standards were initiated by  in particular countries, such as Rainforest Alliance in the United States and Fairtrade in the Netherlands. Other standards were initiated by individual companies, such as  (Ahold), Starbucks C.A.F.E. (Starbucks), and Nespresso AAA (Nespresso). Some standards were launched by coalitions of private firms, development agencies, NGOs, and other stakeholders, such as the , or MSC standard, developed as a collaboration between UniLever and the  . For example, the Common Code for the Coffee Community (4C) was initiated by an alliance of large American coffee roasters, including ,  and , assisted by the German Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development (). One important facilitator for the development of most global standards were series of local development projects involving NGOs, coffee roasters and producers in different developing countries. For example, the Fairtrade standard was developed based on pilot projects with Mexican farmers. 4C builds on development projects in Peru, Colombia and Vietnam, involving GIZ, major coffee roasters, and local producers.\nThe most widely established and adopted standards are in agriculture, with 40% of global coffee production certified to one of the main schemes, and approximately 15-20% of cocoa and tea production being compliant with major international standards. Forestry and wild seafood are also sectors in which standards have been influential, with certified production pushing past 10% of the global share. Cotton, palm oil, soy, biofuels and farmed seafood are some of the commodities in which certification is growing the fastest, due in part to major roundtables that have been set up to bring the whole industry together. More recently, standards have started to emerge for mining and the extraction of metals - including gold, silver, aluminium, and oil and gas - as well as for cattle, electronics, plastics and tourism.\nEvidence suggests that Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) adopted willingly by firms will be much more effective than government regulated CSR so global standards by private companies show promise for effective social impact.\nThe creation of the  in 2002 was the first collaborative effort amongst a group of sustainability standards organisations to agree to follow common good practices in how their standards are implemented and also to work together to drive up the use of standards and certification globally.\nNumerous sustainability standards have been developed in recent years to address issues of environmental quality, social equity, and economic prosperity of global production and trade practices. Despite similarities in major goals and certification procedures, there are some significant differences in terms of their historical development, target groups of adopters, geographical diffusion, and emphasis on environmental, social or economic issues.\nOne of the major differences to be aware of is based on the level of strictness of the standard. Some standards set the bar high for a sector, promoting the strongest social and environmental practices and working with the top performers to constantly push up sustainability expectations. Other standards are more focused on the elimination of the worst practices and operate at more of an entry-level to get a large proportion of an industry working incrementally towards better practices. Often there are strategies between standards to move producers along this performance ladder of sustainability. Another important distinction is that some standards can be applied internationally (usually with mechanisms to ensure local relevance and appropriateness) whereas other standards are developed entirely with a regional or national focus.\nAdditional differences between standards might relate to the certification process and whether it is conducted by a first, second or third party; the traceability system in place and whether it allows for the segregation or mixing of certified and non-certified materials; and the types of sustainability claims that are made on products.\nThe  label was developed in the late 1980s by a Dutch development agency in collaboration with Mexican farmers. The initiative performs  and promotes its political vision of an , seeing its main objective in empowering small producers and providing these with access to and improving their position on global markets. The  feature of the Fairtrade label is the guarantee of a minimum price and a  that goes to the cooperative and not to the producers directly. Recently, Fairtrade also adopted environmental objectives as part of their certification system.\nThe  was created in the late 1980s from a social movement and is committed to conserving rainforests and their biodiversity. One key element of the standard is the compulsory elaboration and implementation of a detailed plan for the development of a sustainable farm management system to assist wildlife conservation. Another objective is to improve workers\u2019 welfare by establishing and securing  livelihoods. Producer prices may carry a premium. Yet instead of guaranteeing a fixed , the standard seeks to improve the economic situation of producers through higher yields and enhanced cost efficiency.\n (formerly Utz Kapeh) was co-founded by the Dutch coffee roaster  in 1997. It aims to create an open and transparent marketplace for socially and environmentally responsible agricultural products.  include the UTZ Traceability System and the UTZ Code of Conduct. The traceability system makes certified products traceable from producer to final buyer and has  chains of custody requirements. The UTZ Code of Conduct emphasizes both environmental practices (e.g. biodiversity conservation, waste handling and water use) and social benefits (e.g. access to medical care, access to sanitary facilities at work).\nThe  standard was developed in the 1970s and is based on  Basic Standards. IFOAM stands for International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements and is the leading global umbrella organization for the organic farming movement. The IFOAM Basic Standards provide a framework of minimum requirements, including the omission of agrochemicals such as pesticides and chemical-synthetic fertilizers. The use of animal feeds is also strictly regulated. Genetic engineering and the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are forbidden.\nThe  is designed to evaluate the social, economic,  and environmental performance of Indian tea estates, smallholders and Bought Leaf Factories (BLFs).\nIt is expected that the compliance with the code not only improves competitiveness of the tea farms but also facilitates the tea farms in achieving compliance with national regulations and international sustainability standards in a step-wise approach. The applicable control points under eleven chapters are required to be adhered to within a four-year period. The India tea code allows producers to show that they operate responsibly\u2013 producing quality tea according to strict social and environmental standards. The verification under the code provides manufacturers with the assurance of responsible production and provides opportunities to credibly demonstrate this to their customers.\nSuRe\u00ae is a global voluntary standard which integrates key criteria of resilience and sustainability into infrastructure development, through various criteria across governance, social and environmental factors.

They provide modelling techniques and indexes to compare the measurement and have methods to convert the scientific measurement results into easy to understand terms.\nThe United Nations has developed extensive sustainability measurement  tools in relation to sustainable development  as well as a .\nThe UN  (CSD) has published a list of 140 indicators which covers environmental, social, economical and institutional aspects of sustainable development.\nIn the last couple of decades, there has arisen a crowded toolbox of quantitative methods used to assess sustainability \u2014 including measures of resource use like , measures of consumption like the  and measurements of quality of environmental governance like the . The following is a list of quantitative \"tools\" used by sustainability scientists - the different categories are for convenience only as defining criteria will inter grade. It would be too difficult to list all those methods available at different levels of the organisation so those listed here are at for the global level only.\n \n \n \n \n \nPart of this process can relate to resource use such as  or to economic metrics or  values as compared to  potential, for understanding resource use.\n\nAn important task for resource theory () is to develop methods to optimize resource conversion processes. These systems are described and analyzed by means of the methods of mathematics and the natural sciences. Human factors, however, have dominated the development of our perspective of the relationship between nature and society since at least the , and in particular, have influenced how we describe and measure the economic impacts of changes in resource quality. A balanced view of these issues requires an understanding of the physical framework in which all human ideas, institutions, and aspirations must operate.When oil production first began in the mid-nineteenth century, the largest oil fields recovered fifty barrels of oil for every barrel used in the extraction, transportation, and refining. This ratio is often referred to as the Energy Return on Energy Investment (EROI or ).  Currently, between one and five barrels of oil are recovered for each barrel-equivalent of energy used in the recovery process.  As the EROEI drops to one, or equivalently the  falls to zero, the oil production is no longer a net energy source.  This happens long before the resource is physically exhausted.\nNote that it is important to understand the distinction between a barrel of oil, which is a measure of oil, and a  (BOE), which is a measure of energy. Many sources of energy, such as fission, solar, wind, and coal, are not subject to the same near-term supply restrictions that oil is. Accordingly, even an oil source with an EROEI of 0.5 can be usefully exploited if the energy required to produce that oil comes from a cheap and plentiful energy source.  Availability of cheap, but hard to transport, natural gas in some oil fields has led to using  to fuel . Similarly, natural gas in huge amounts is used to power most  plants. Cheap natural gas has also led to  produced with a net EROEI of less than 1, although figures in this area are controversial because methods to measure EROEI are in debate.\nInsofar as  is driven by oil consumption growth, post-peak societies must adapt.  believed:\nOur principal constraints are cultural.  During the last two centuries we have known nothing but exponential growth and in parallel we have evolved what amounts to an exponential-growth culture, a culture so heavily dependent upon the continuance of exponential growth for its stability that it is incapable of reckoning with problems of nongrowth.Some economists describe the problem as  or a .

It can be used as reference for many metrics for non-renewable resources such as:\nAlthough  receives most attention in relation to , it has also been applied to other natural resources.\nDoug Reynolds predicted in 2005 that the North American peak would occur in 2007.  Bentley (p.\u00a0189) predicted a world \"decline in conventional gas production from about 2020\".\nPeak coal is significantly further out than peak oil, but we can observe the example of  in the US, a high grade coal whose production peaked in the 1920s.  Anthracite was studied by Hubbert, and matches a curve closely.  Pennsylvania's coal production also matches Hubbert's curve closely, but this does not mean that coal in Pennsylvania is exhausted\u2014far from it.  If production in Pennsylvania returned at its all-time high, there are reserves for 190 years.  Hubbert had recoverable  at 2500 \u00d7 10 metric tons and peaking around 2150(depending on usage).\nMore recent estimates suggest an earlier peak.  (PDF 630KB ), published on April 5, 2007 by the Energy Watch Group (EWG), which reports to the German Parliament, found that global coal production could peak in as few as 15 years.  Reporting on this Richard Heinberg also notes that the date of peak annual energetic extraction from coal will likely come earlier than the date of peak in quantity of coal (tons  per year) extracted as the most energy-dense types of coal have been mined most extensively.  A second study,\n by B. Kavalov and S. D. Peteves of the Institute for Energy (IFE), prepared for European Commission Joint Research Centre, reaches similar conclusions and states that\n\"\"coal might not be so abundant, widely available and reliable as an energy source in the future\".\nWork by  of  predicts that the total of world coal production will amount to only about 450 . This\nimplies that coal is running out faster than usually assumed.\nFinally, insofar as global  and peak in natural gas are expected anywhere from imminently to within decades at most, any increase in coal production (mining) per annum to compensate for declines in oil or NG production, would necessarily translate to an earlier date of peak as compared with peak coal under a scenario in which annual production remains constant.\nIn a paper in 1956,  after a review of US fissionable reserves, Hubbert notes of nuclear power:\nThere is promise, however, provided mankind can solve its international problems and not destroy itself with nuclear weapons, and provided world population (which is now expanding at such a rate as to double in less than a century) can somehow be brought under control, that we may at last have found an energy supply adequate for our needs for at least the next few centuries of the \"foreseeable future.\"Technologies such as the ,  and  can, in theory, considerably extend the life of  reserves.  claims \nOur current throwaway nuclear cycle uses up the world reserve of low-cost uranium in about 20 years.Caltech physics professor  has stated that\n... you would have to build 10,000 of the largest power plants that are feasible by engineering standards in order to replace the 10 terawatts of fossil fuel we're burning today ... that's a staggering amount and if you did that, the known reserves of uranium would last for 10 to 20 years at that burn rate. So, it's at best a bridging technology ... You can use the rest of the uranium to breed plutonium 239 then we'd have at least 100 times as much fuel to use. But that means you're making plutonium, which is an extremely dangerous thing to do in the dangerous world that we live in.Hubbert applied his theory to \"rock containing an abnormally high concentration of a given metal\" and reasoned that the peak production for metals such as , , ,  and others would occur in the time frame of decades and  in the time frame of two centuries like coal. The price of copper rose 500% between 2003 and 2007 was by some attributed to . Copper prices later fell, along with many other commodities and stock prices, as demand shrank from fear of a .  availability is a concern for a fleet of  using cars but a paper published in 1996 estimated that world reserves are adequate for at least 50 years.  A similar prediction  for  use in fuel cells notes that the metal could be easily recycled.\n supplies are essential to farming and depletion of reserves is estimated at somewhere from 60 to 130 years.  Individual countries supplies vary widely; without a recycling initiative America's supply  is estimated around 30 years.  Phosphorus supplies affect total agricultural output which in turn limits alternative fuels such as biodiesel and ethanol.\nHubbert's original analysis did not apply to renewable resources.  However  often results in a Hubbert peak nonetheless.  A modified Hubbert curve applies to any resource that can be harvested faster than it can be replaced.\nFor example, a reserve such as the  can be mined at a rate that far exceeds replenishment.  This turns much of the world's underground water  and lakes  into finite resources with peak usage debates similar to oil.  These debates usually center around agriculture and suburban water usage but generation of electricity  from nuclear energy or coal and tar sands mining mentioned above is also water resource intensive.  The term  is sometimes used to describe aquifers whose water is not being recharged.\nSustainability measurements and indicators is an ever-evolving and changing process and has various gaps to be filled in order to achieve a proper framework and model. Following points are some of the breaks in continuity:\n"},
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability_accounting", "title": "SustainabilityaccountingWikipedia", "body": " (also known as , , , , or ) was originated about 20 years ago and is considered a subcategory of  that focuses on the disclosure of non-financial information about a firm's performance to external stakeholders, such as capital holders, creditors, and other authorities. Sustainability accounting represents the activities that have a direct impact on society, environment, and economic performance of an organisation. Sustainability accounting in managerial accounting contrasts with financial accounting in that  is used for internal decision making and the creation of new policies that will have an effect on the organisation's performance at economic, ecological, and social (known as the  or Triple-P's; ) level. Sustainability accounting is often used to generate value creation within an organisation.\nSustainability accounting is a tool used by organisations to become more sustainable. The most known widely used measurements are the Corporate Sustainability Reporting (CSR) and triple bottom line accounting. These recognise the role of financial information and shows how traditional  is extended by improving transparency and accountability by reporting on the Triple-P's.\nAs a result of triple bottom level reporting, and in order to render and guarantee consistency in social and environmental information, the GRI () was established with the goal to provide guidelines to organisations reporting on sustainability. In some countries, guidelines were developed to complement the GRI. The GRI states that \"reporting on economic, environmental and social performance by all organizations is as routine and comparable as financial reporting\".\nIn order to help finance teams and accountants embed sustainability into their accounting, The Prince of Wales set up The Prince's Accounting for Sustainability Project (A4S) in 2004.\nThe concept of sustainability accounting has emerged from developments in accounting. Broad developments in accounting have occurred over the past forty years, although narrow developments have occurred over the past ten years. The development reveals two distinct lines of analysis. The first line is the philosophical debate about accountability, if and how it contributes to sustainable development, and which are the necessary steps towards sustainability. This approach is based on an entirely new system of accounting designed to promote a strategy of sustainability. The second line is the management perspective associated with varied terms and tools towards sustainability. This could be seen as an extension of or modification to conventional financial cost or management accounting. To develop sustainability accounting de novo allows a complete reappraisal of the relative significance of social, environmental and economic benefits and risks and their interactions in corporate accounting systems.\nThe developments that lead to sustainable accounting could be distinguished in several time periods in which a number of trends were evident: 1971\u20131980, 1981\u20131990, 1991\u20131995 and up to the present. These periods distinguish empirical studies, normative statements, philosophical discussion, teaching programmes, literature and regulatory frameworks.\nBy the end of the decade, a large volume of empirical work and a number of papers referring to the building of models which foster social accounting disclosures have been published. These early works included subjective analysis as well as underdeveloped social and environmental accounting literature (SEAL). Information related to the social dimension of accounting has been mostly connected with employees or products. Environmental matters were treated as part of a generally undifferentiated and fairly unsophisticated social accounting movement.\nEnvironmental damage included damage to terrain, air, water, noise, visual and aesthetic and other forms of pollution, and solid-waste production. Ideas about  and mapping of  first arose and began to develop. Albeit the contribution of this period was notable for extensive developments in the field of social audit, the methodology was nearly identical with the historical financial accounting reports.\nAt this time neither financial accounting standards nor regulatory frameworks had been developed to any extent. The empirical studies and research were mainly descriptive. Although several models and similar normative statements were enhanced, the philosophical debate was not widespread.\nThe first part of the decade showed increased sophistication within the social accounting area and the second part of the decade saw an apparent transference of interest to environmental accounting, with increasing signs of specialisation in literature. Empirical research was more analytical. Concerns of social disclosures have been replaced by a concentration on environmental disclosures and regulation as an alternative means of reducing environmental damage. Normative statements and model building began to foster the environmental arena.\nDuring this period, the development of teaching programmes about social and environmental accounting issues began.\nDespite an increasing use of conceptual frameworks, accounting standards, and legal provisions to reduce the degree of individual interpretation in financial reporting, little of this accounting structure applies to an appropriate framework of social and environmental accounting. Less normative statement have been made, but more articles discussing philosophical matters have been published.\nThis period was characterised by the almost complete domination of environmental accounting over social accounting. There have also been a number of extensions from environmental disclosures to environmental auditing as well as the development of framework to guide the applications of environmental auditing, and in particular, the development of environmental management systems. There was still little regulatory framework affecting social and environmental accounting disclosures and conceptual frameworks for accounting did not extend to non-financial quantification and social or environmental issues. The development of a clear regulatory as well as conceptual framework grew in several countries, whereas the progress of environmental regulation in the UK and Europe was slower than in the United States, Canada or Australia. The progress was uneven but rapid compared with those in the area of social accounting disclosures. During this period, there have been several textbooks and journal articles covering both social and environmental accounting. However, there has been a relative lack of normative/philosophical work within accounting during this period: environmental accounting has not been revived since the models of the 1970s and has failed to adapt to the discussions about the valuation of externalities. Sustainability and the discussion of the role of management accounting in assisting with sustainable development have become of growing interest.\nThe convergence of global capital markets and the emergence of global and regional quality control issues \u2013 culminating for the accounting profession in the  in 1997\u20131998 as well the collapse of  in 2001 \u2013 led to a subsequent high-level focus on international and national accounting. The accounting literature has demonstrated a considerable increase in concern for the issues of sustainable development and accounting. Via the exploration of what sustainability accounting may entail, the accounting profession is likely to be involved in re-examining accounting fundamentals in the light of the challenge of sustainable development. Several proposals and significant statistical work as well as a growing body of measurement on accounting for sustainable development is being carried out in many international and national settings.\nEven supra-national policy bodies like the  and the  have sponsored work addressing accounting for sustainability. Up till now environmental accounting is the most evolved form of sustainability accounting and increasingly processed in the academic circle beginning with the work of  in the early 1990s, and through the release of the Sustainability Accounting Guidelines at the  in 2002.\nDue to the use of different frameworks and methods, much uncertainty remains how this agenda will develop in the future. What is certain is that there is belief that past economic development and the current human (and hence business) activities are not sustainable, which has led to questioning the current mode of development. Recent years have seen an increasing acceptance and even enthusiasm for these new reporting approaches. Energetic and innovative experimentation by far-sighted organisations state that sustainability aspects in accounting and reporting are crucially important, feasible and practicable as well.\nIn this respect, the  (IFAC), whose objective is to develop the accounting profession and harmonise its standards, includes 167 member bodies in over 127 countries and represents approximately over two million accountants worldwide.\nIn 2004, the Prince of Wales set up his Accounting for Sustainability Project (A4S) to \"help ensure that we are not battling to meet 21st century challenges with, at best, 20th century decision-making and reporting systems\". A4S convenes leaders in the finance and accounting communities to catalyse a fundamental shift towards resilient business models and a sustainable economy. A4S has two global networks \u2013 the Accounting Bodies Network (ABN) whose members comprise approximately two thirds of the world's accountants and the A4S CFO Leadership Network, a group of CFOs from leading companies seeking to transform finance and accounting.\nSustainability accounting has increased in popularity in the last couple of decades. Many companies are adopting new methods and techniques in their financial disclosures and are providing information about the core activities and the impact that these have on the environment. As a result of this, stakeholders, suppliers, and governmental institutions want a better understanding of how companies manage their resources to achieve their goals to accomplish sustainable development. \nAccording to common definitions there are three key dimensions of sustainability. Every dimension focuses on different subsets.\nSustainability accounting connects the companies' strategies from a sustainable framework by disclosing information on the three dimensional levels (environment, economical and social). In practice, however, it is difficult to put together policies that simultaneously promote environmental, economic and social goals.\nThis trend has encouraged companies to not only emphasize creation of value but also risk mitigation that are linked to the environmental and social subset of sustainable development. This development has been driven by multiple factors connected to:\nThe concept of sustainability accounting is being carried out in an international setting with a vast and growing level of experience in the measurement of sustainable development. It recognises the role of financial information and shows how this can be extended to the social and environmental level. Although there isn't an established framework of reporting, the content of a company's report can be largely determined by factors and reporting standards, guidelines, and regulations. This trend offers companies a greater flexibility than financial statements. An effective report delivers information aligned to the company's overall objectives and engage with the audience in a manner that promotes the exchange of ideas and communication.\nNowadays, there are several ways and mechanisms of reporting, such as assurance statements, environmental, social and economic performance reports, that have been noted. Some of these reports include shorter and more concise reports. Some companies are including in their reports a combination of hard copies and online resources as well as downloadable PDF files. Some examples can be found at the GRI, which is the most popular framework for companies that are looking for help and assistance in how to create their sustainability report.\nAs the trend to produce sustainability reports increases, so too do the guidelines and frameworks to report on the social environmental information.\nAs sustainability accounting continues to develop, companies continue to gain understanding of the scenery of reporting frameworks, standards and guidelines that may affect the form and content of their reports. There are several organisations that offer services to companies that want to change their traditional financial statement disclosures for sustainability reporting.\nIn most countries around the world, there are currently no governmental requirements for companies to prepare and publish sustainability reports. Companies that have started to adopt this new method of reporting have faced new challenges in reporting due to the lack of experience. Failing to report accordingly to the guidelines and frameworks provided (see OECD and GRI) would lead them to potentially reduce their credibility of published information.\nThe GRI, OECD and UNCSD () are some of the main actors in developing a policy framework that better integrates the three dimensional levels of sustainability by decoupling economic growth from environmental pressures.\nThe GRI is a multi-stakeholder organization that is committed to developing and maintaining the \"Sustainability Reporting Guidelines.\" The goal is the continuous improvement of sustainability reporting, a protocol that approaches the application levels. There are three levels of reporting: A, B and C, but these are not yet legally ratified fundamentals and are only used to assist companies with their sustainable reports.\nOn one hand, the UNCSD focuses only on the environmental dimension of the sustainability accounting.\nOn the other hand, the OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) focuses only in two frameworks: the analytical and accounting frameworks.\nAnalytical frameworks link information from different areas. Various types of frameworks are being used nowadays depending on the purpose of measurement. These frameworks seek to:\nSome examples of analytical frameworks are: Pressure \u2013 State \u2013 Response (PSR) model which is based on one of its variants, Driving Force \u2013 Pressure \u2013 State \u2013 Impact \u2013 Response used by the European Environment Agency (EEA), or the Driving Force \u2013 State \u2013 Response model.\nOne such analytical framework is the sustainability balanced scorecard model. Using the popular  framework as its basis, the sustainability balanced scorecard model requires new data for sustainability, which can be obtained through eco-efficiency analysis. Eco-efficiency analysis observes the causal relationship between economic value creation and environmental impact added through two forms of assessment: lifecycle inventories and lifecycle impact. These assessments connect the balanced scorecard to corporate environmental accounting systems by joining different modeling processes. This method observes the relationships between the social, environmental, and economic dimensions.\nAnother analytical framework that monitors and tracks corporate performance is the sustainability evaluation and reporting system (SERS). Developed by the Research Centre of Bocconi University on Risk, Security, Occupational Health and Safety, Environment and Crisis Management (SPACE), SERS was developed to address the challenges faced by organizations when managing various stakeholder relationships. SERS compiles various management tools (e.g. key performance indicators, environmental reporting, and social reporting) to create an inclusive model. SERS is composed of three modules: the overall reporting system (which is composed of the , the social report, the environmental report, and a set of integrated performance indicators), the integrated information system, and KPIs for corporate sustainability. SERS is flexible, allowing it to be applied to companies across different industries, sizes, and countries. SERS also allows for the comprehensive monitoring of qualitative and quantitative information to aid in overall corporate goals. For example, a metric could compare the total value of waste generated during the year to the value added by a process.\nOn the other hand, the accounting frameworks seek to quantify information in the three dimensions of sustainability accounting. The System of National Accounts (SNA) show that measuring sustainable development with the conventional system of financial reporting is inadequate. The accounting structure imposes a more systematic approach that is not too flexible in comparison to the standards and frameworks that offer the GRI and OECD among others. Accounting for sustainability therefore requires an extension of its standard framework.\nThe OECD offers two different approaches to the accounting framework for sustainability accounting.\n requires a clear understanding of the relationships that exists between the natural environment and the economy. It is not possible without understanding the physical representation. The physical flow accounts are helpful in showing the characteristics of production and consumption activities. Some of these accounts focus on the physical exchange between the economic system and natural environment.\n to sustainability refer to the preservation of stock of wealth. Sustainability is observed as the maintenance of the capital base of a country and therefore potentially measured. A number of environmental changes are also contained in these financial statements that are measured during an accounting period of time.\nThe GRI offers advanced material to help organisations of all types to create their accountability reports. This published material lead organisations through the reporting process with the main idea of becoming more sustainable in their practices in everyday business.\nSpecific techniques to measure information in sustainability accounting include:\nThe  focuses on the different categories of natural capital and their consumption and/or enhancement. This approach identifies, records, monitors, and then reports on these different categories. These categories are analyzed according to specific classifications, including critical, non-renewable/nonsubstitutable, non-renewable/substitutable, and renewable natural capital.\nThe  results in a notional amount on the income statement that quantifies the organization's failure to \"leave the biosphere at the end of the accounting period no worse off than it was at the beginning of the accounting period\". In other words, this amount represents how much it would cost an organization to return the biosphere to its natural state at the beginning of the accounting period.\nThe  attempts to report the resource flows of the organization. Rather than explicitly reporting sustainability, it focuses on resources used to provide transparency. This approach catalogues the resources flowing into and out of the organization to pinpoint potential areas of improvement.\nThere are six main motivations for practicing sustainability accounting:\nM\u00f6ller and Schaltegger add that another motivation is to assist in decision-making. They state that making decisions solely based on financial information is superficial at best. They add that there are certain business areas that financial data cannot precisely evaluate, such as customer satisfaction, organizational learning, and product quality. They propose that a mix of financial and nonfinancial info can help make well-informed decisions.\nShareholders say that they want to see more sustainability reporting because it translates to increased corporate financial performance. This is because sustainability requires a long-term vision, which is reflected in strategic planning. Strategic planning is manifested in long-term visions and a wider range of responsibilities toward its stakeholders. Companies that place emphasis on sustainability practices have higher financial performance, as measured by profit before taxation, return on assets, and cash flow from operations, than their counterparts.\nThe listed organisations and initiatives assist companies in pursuing sustainability accounting. For further information about why and how to report consult the following organisations.\nNevertheless, the development of regulatory frameworks is getting closer in several countries; accountants will need to broaden their knowledge and to establish a common dialogue with social and ecological professionals. The formation of independent  sustainability teams to prepare and audit sustainability accounts would add credibility to the process.\nLike the sections above illustrated, sustainable accounting resulted in different interpretations and intended uses of accounting. The development of a pragmatic set of tools for corporate practice is progress. Future research will address the real challenges to corporate management to develop pragmatic tools for a well described set of business situations. Current needs include the need to address the decision and control needs of corporate managers, whether or not it is the case that they are responsible for environmental, social or economic issues associated with corporate activities. The  and complementary situations need to be identified and analysed, and accounting that provides a basis for movement towards corporate and general sustainability needs to be developed.\nTo fall short of a convincing conceptualization will leave sustainability accounting as a broad term, with little practical usefulness. The linkage between sustainability accounting and sustainability reporting needs to be extended as well. In this context, sustainability reporting remains at an unfinished stage of development and at present is still more of a buzzword than a well defined approach. The debate remains open to challenge this goal on the premise of sustainability, its operationalisation and its accountings.\nIn light of these aspects, Geoff Lamberton provides a promising framework for the various forms of accounting. It draws together the five general major themes evident in social and environmental accounting research and practice, including the GRI Sustainability Accounting Guidelines. He depicts a comprehensive sustainability accounting framework which displays the complex interconnections between the various components and dimensions of sustainability. It balances the need for integration of the variety in information, measurements and reporting with the differentiated unitary information effects between the dimensions of sustainable development. The multiple units of measurement include narratives of social policy and procedures as well traditional accounting principles and practice.\nAssumptions underpinning the specification of this framework are:\nIt is unrealistic to expect business to voluntarily commit the resources required for full sustainable accounting implementation. For financing the implementation of sustainability accounting and reporting one option would be to use environmental taxes to raise revenue and to discourage negative environmental impacts. Once the sustainability accounting system is established tax rates could be linked to (sustainability) performance outcomes to encourage the transition to sustainability at the organizational level.\nA promising trail in a similar way may be the concept of the community welfare economics (German: ) by . More like a framework for sustainability accounting, it is a framework or an alternative way of economics and the society in general. It suggests that business should measure its contributions of economic success according to the benefits reimbursed to the society as social and ecological factors. Similar to tax principles, the business performance is specified by an accounts of points (representing the contributions to overall well-being) and therefore the company receives (tax) benefits or support in other various form.\nA further interesting example is provided by the Sustainability Flower which was developed in 2009 by an international group of prominent pioneers and innovators of the organic movement. The Flowers performance indicators were defined on the basis of the GRI Guidelines and seeks to unite four dimensions of sustainability (economic life, societal life, cultural life and ecology with six sub dimensions) in a model.\nA further promising approach toward the measurement of human, social and  including environmental quality, health, security, equity, education and free time is made by the Buddhist foundation and the Bhutan Government toward operationalising the objective of . These innovative projects may demonstrate that an alternative cultural perspective is needed as well to inform an accounting that is capable of making a genuine contribution to sustainability. The future direction of sustainability accounting and sustaining economic development should continue to display the essential quality of diversity.\nDespite the promising approaches to sustainability reporting, there are still concerns regarding the effectiveness of such reports. Rodriguez, Cotran, and Stewart highlight the  as one such report. Under SASB, certain sustainability metrics have been standardized to help investors evaluate corporate risk profiles of companies.  In 2016, SASB conducted a study analyzing the current state of disclosure by observing the practices of the largest ten companies (by revenue) in each of the 79 industries. The study showed that sustainability disclosure in  filings varies amongst industries. This variability is likely driven by characteristics unique to the industry, such as the regulatory environment. Additionally, the study found that while most industries possess high levels of disclosure, the quality of the disclosures are low.\nAdams and Frost conducted a study examining three Australian and four British companies. Adams and Frost were concerned with the completeness and authenticity of sustainability reports and the motives of the managers issuing them. The companies observed in the study have been practicing sustainability reporting for several years and are considered to be adopting best practices for sustainability reporting. Specifically, Adams and Frost examine the  developed in these companies to measure performance and how these KPIs are implemented in the decision-making process and performance management. The study showed that challenges faced by companies during the KPI development process varied widely, from adapting for different geographic regions and cultures to creating targets. Lastly, the study also showed that when information was not advantageous to the organization, responsibility to the stakeholder is undermined. Adams and Frost suggest that an increase in governmental involvement may lead to adoptions that will in turn improve corporate performance. Furthermore, the increasing demand by shareholders for non-financial information is expected to serve as an impetus for greater transparency, such as the use of standardized reporting metrics. Adams and Frost state that despite the positive correlation between sustainability and financial performance, transparency must improve to meet the needs of the shareholders.\nWhile the creation of sustainability frameworks and measurements to improve the communication between businesses and shareholders is valuable, there is still room for improvement. To help address this need, a new form of sustainability accounting known as  (CBS) has been in development since 2005. Contrary to many other approaches to the subject, which tend to be purely incrementalist in form (i.e., they measure impacts on resources in terms of  this year, or ), CBS assesses impacts relative to sustainability standards of performance that are specific to individual organizations and explicitly tied to resource limits and thresholds in the world (social, environmental and economic).  The most recent and fully elaborated implementation of CBS is the MultiCapital Scorecard method, first put forward by its creators in 2013.\n"},

Sustainable food systems have been argued to be central to many or all .\nMoving to sustainable food systems is an important component of addressing the . A 2020 review conducted for the European Union found that up to 37% of global greenhouse gas emissions could be attributed to the food system, including crop and livestock production, transportation, changing land use (including deforestation) and food loss and waste. Sustainable food systems are frequently at the center of sustainability focused policy programs, such as proposed  programs.\nThere are many different definitions of a sustainable food system.\nFrom a global perspective, the  of the United Nations describes a sustainable food system as follows: \nA sustainable food system (SFS) is a food system that delivers food security and nutrition for all in such a way that the economic, social and environmental bases to generate food security and nutrition for future generations are not compromised.

Food processing began when the number of consumers started growing rapidly. The demand for cheap and efficient calories climbed resulting in nutrition decline. Industrialized agriculture, due to its reliance on economies of scale to reduce production costs, often leads to the compromising of local, regional, or even global  through fertilizer runoff,  pollution, and .\nAlso, the need to reduce production costs in an increasingly global market can cause production of foods to be moved to areas where economic costs (labor, taxes, etc.) are lower or environmental regulations are more lax, which are usually further from consumer markets. For example, the majority of salmon sold in the United States is raised off the coast of Chile, due in large part to less stringent Chilean standards regarding fish feed and regardless of the fact that salmon are not indigenous in Chilean coastal waters. The globalization of food production can result in the loss of traditional food systems in , and have negative impacts on the , ecosystems, and  in those countries.\nAt the global level the environmental impact of agribusiness is being addressed through  and .

Fish that occupy the higher  are less efficient sources of food energy.\nFishery ecosystems are an important subset of the wider marine environment. This article documents the views of  and  about innovative approaches towards sustainable fisheries.\n\nIn his 1883 inaugural address to the International Fisheries Exhibition in London,  asserted that overfishing or \"permanent exhaustion\" was scientifically impossible, and stated that probably \"all the great sea fisheries are inexhaustible\". In reality, by 1883 marine fisheries were already collapsing. The  was established 12 years earlier for the purpose of finding why fisheries in  were declining. At the time of Huxley's address, the Atlantic  fishery had already collapsed (and has never recovered).\nTraditionally,  and the science underpinning it was distorted by its \"narrow focus on  and the corresponding failure to account for ecosystem effects leading to declines of species abundance and diversity\" and by perceiving the fishing industry as \"the sole legitimate user, in effect the owner, of marine living resources.\" Historically, stock assessment scientists usually worked in government laboratories and considered their work to be providing services to the fishing industry. These scientists dismissed conservation issues and distanced themselves from the scientists and the science that raised the issues. This happened even as commercial fish stocks deteriorated, and even though many governments were signatories to binding conservation agreements.\n, of the , distinguishes three ways of defining a sustainable fishery:\nFisheries and aquaculture are, directly or indirectly, a source of livelihood for over 500 million people, mostly in developing countries.\nSocial sustainability can conflict with biodiversity. A fishery is socially sustainable if the fishery ecosystem maintains the ability to deliver products the society can use. Major species shifts within the ecosystem could be acceptable as long as the flow of such products continues. Humans have been operating such regimes for thousands of years, transforming many ecosystems, depleting or driving to extinction many species.\nTo a great extent, sustainability is like good art, it is hard to describe but we know it when we see it.According to Hilborn, the \"loss of some species, and indeed transformation of the ecosystem is not incompatible with sustainable harvests.\" For example, in recent years,  have been caught as  in the western Atlantic. Their numbers have severely declined and they will probably go extinct if these catch rates continue. Even if the barndoor skate goes extinct, changing the ecosystem, there could still be sustainable fishing of other commercial species.\nAt the Fourth World Fisheries Congress in 2004,  asked, \"How can fisheries science and conservation biology achieve a reconciliation?\", then answered his own question, \"By accepting each other\u2019s \nessentials: that fishing should remain a viable occupation; and that aquatic ecosystems and their biodiversity are allowed to persist.\"\nA relatively new concept is relationship farming. This is a way of operating farms so they restore the  in their area. Re-establishing a healthy food chain can result in the farm automatically filtering out impurities from feed water and air, feeding its own food chain, and additionally producing high net yields for harvesting. An example is the large cattle ranch  in southern Spain. Relationship farming was first made popular by  who created a 220 hectare relationship farm featured prominently in  book  (2006) and the documentary films,  and . The basic concept of relationship farming is to put effort into building a healthy food chain, and then the food chain does the hard work.\nOverfishing can be sustainable. According to Hilborn, overfishing can be \"a misallocation of societies' resources\", but it does not necessarily threaten conservation or sustainability\".\n is traditionally defined as harvesting so many fish that the yield is less than it would be if fishing were reduced. For example,  are usually managed by trying to determine how many spawning salmon, called the \"\", are needed each generation to produce the maximum harvestable surplus. The optimum escapement is that needed to reach that surplus. If the escapement is half the optimum, then normal fishing looks like overfishing. But this is still sustainable fishing, which could continue indefinitely at its reduced stock numbers and yield. There is a wide range of escapement sizes that present no threat that the stock might collapse or that the stock structure might erode.\nOn the other hand, overfishing can precede severe stock depletion and fishery collapse. Hilborn points out that continuing to exert fishing pressure while production decreases, stock collapses and the fishery fails, is largely \"the product of institutional failure.\"\nToday over 70% of fish species are either fully exploited, overexploited, depleted, or recovering from depletion. If overfishing does not decrease, it is predicted that stocks of all species currently commercially fished for will collapse by 2048.\u201d\nA Hubbert linearization () has been applied to the  industry, as well as charting the price of , which depends on  stocks. Another example is  . Comparing fisheries and mineral extraction tells us that human pressure on the environment is causing a wide range of resources to go through a Hubbert depletion cycle.\nNearly all the world's , and large areas of , underwater ridges, and , have had heavy  and  repeatedly dragged over their surfaces. For fifty years, governments and organizations, such as the , have encouraged the fishing industry to develop trawler fleets. Repeated  and dredging literally flattens diversity in the  habitat, radically changing the associated communities.\nSince 1950, 90 percent of 25 species of big predator fish have gone.\nRising ocean temperatures and  are radically altering .  is modifying fish distribution and the productivity of marine and freshwater species. This reduces sustainable catch levels across many habitats, puts pressure on resources needed for , on the communities that depend on fisheries, and on the oceans' ability to capture and store carbon ().  puts coastal  at risk, while changing rainfall patterns and water use impact on inland (freshwater) fisheries and aquaculture.\nA recent survey of global ocean health concluded that all parts of the ocean have been affected by human development and that 41 percent has been fouled with human polluted runoff, , and other abuses.  is not easy to fix, because pollution sources are so dispersed, and are built into the economic systems we depend on.\nThe  (UNEP) mapped the impacts of stressors such as climate change, pollution, , and  of resources on the oceans. The report shows at least 75 percent of the world's key fishing grounds may be affected.\nLarge predator  fish can  contain significant amounts of mercury, a neurotoxin which can affect , memory, mental focus, and produce tremors.\nLakes are dependent on the inflow of water from its . In some areas, aggressive irrigation has caused this inflow to decrease significantly, causing water depletion and a shrinking of the lake. The most notable example is the , formerly among the four  in the world, now only a tenth of its former surface area.\n draws on  to enable sustainable exploitation. Modern fisheries management is often defined as mandatory rules based on concrete objectives and a mix of management techniques, enforced by a  system.\n\nAccording to  Chris Frid, the  points to  and  as the causes of recent, unprecedented declines in fish populations. Frid counters that  has also altered the way the  works. \"Everybody would like to see the rebuilding of fish stocks and this can only be achieved if we understand all of the influences, human and natural, on fish dynamics.\u201d He adds: \u201cfish communities can be altered in a number of ways, for example they can decrease if particular-sized individuals of a species are targeted, as this affects . Fishing, however, is not the sole cause of changes to \u2014 is another example....No one factor operates in isolation and components of the ecosystem respond differently to each individual factor.\"\nThe traditional approach to fisheries science and management has been to focus on a single species. This can be contrasted with the . Ecosystem-based fishery concepts have been implemented in some regions. In a 2007 effort to \"stimulate much needed discussion\" and \"clarify the essential components\" of ecosystem-based fisheries science, a group of scientists offered the following \nStrategies and techniques for marine conservation tend to combine theoretical disciplines, such as population biology, with practical conservation strategies, such as setting up protected areas, as with  (MPAs) or . Each nation defines MPAs independently, but they commonly involve increased protection for the area from fishing and other threats.\nMarine life is not evenly distributed in the oceans. Most of the really valuable ecosystems are in relatively shallow coastal waters, above or near the , where the sunlit waters are often nutrient rich from  or  at the continental edge, allowing photosynthesis, which energizes the lowest trophic levels. In the 1970s, for reasons more to do with  than with fishing, the U.S. extended its jurisdiction, then 12 miles from the coast, to 200 miles. This made huge shelf areas part of its territory. Other nations followed, extending national control to what became known as the  (EEZ). This move has had many implications for fisheries conservation, since it means that most of the most productive maritime ecosystems are now under national jurisdictions, opening possibilities for protecting these ecosystems by passing appropriate laws.\n characterises marine protected areas as \"a conservation tool of revolutionary importance that is being incorporated into the fisheries mainstream.\"  have funded various initiatives aimed at encouraging the development of MPAs and other ocean conservation measures.\nThere exists concerns that  cannot produce necessary yields efficiently. For example, farmed salmon eat three pounds of wild fish to produce one pound of salmon.\nInternational laws and treaties related to  include the 1966 .  laws related to marine conservation include the 1972 , as well as the 1972  which established the  program. .\nVarious organizations promote sustainable fishing strategies, educate the public and stakeholders, and lobby for conservation law and policy.

According to the marine conservation biologist , four criteria apply when choosing seafood:\nThe following organizations have download links for wallet-sized cards, listing good and bad choices:\nOne of the major impediments to the rational control of marine resources is inadequate data. According to fisheries scientist Milo Adkison (2007), the primary limitation in fisheries management decisions is poor data. Fisheries management decisions are often based on population models, but the models need quality data to be accurate. Scientists and fishery managers would be better served with simpler models and improved data.\nEstimates of illegal catch losses range between $10 billion and $23 billion annually, representing between 11 and 26 million .\n is the way significant changes to a system are measured against previous baselines, which themselves may represent significant changes from the original state of the system. The term was first used by the   in his paper \"Anecdotes and the shifting baseline syndrome of fisheries\". Pauly developed the term in reference to  where fisheries scientists sometimes fail to identify the correct \"\" population size (e.g. how abundant a fish species population was  human exploitation) and thus work with a . He describes the way that radically depleted fisheries were evaluated by experts who used the state of the fishery at the start of their careers as the baseline, rather than the fishery in its untouched state. Areas that swarmed with a particular species hundreds of years ago, may have experienced long-term decline, but it is the level of decades previously that is considered the appropriate reference point for current populations. In this way large declines in ecosystems or species over long periods of time were, and are, masked.

It can be based on an understanding of . There are many methods to increase the sustainability of agriculture. When developing agriculture within , it is important to develop flexible business process and farming practices.\nAgriculture has an enormous , playing an outsized role in causing , , ,  and other processes; it is simultaneously causing environmental changes and being impacted by these changes. Developing sustainable food systems, contributes to the  of the human population.  For example, one of the best ways to mitigate climate change is to create  based on sustainable agriculture. Sustainable agriculture provides a potential solution to enable agricultural systems to feed a growing population within the changing environmental conditions. \nIn 1907 Franklin H. King in his book  discussed the advantages of sustainable agriculture, and warned that such practices would be vital to farming in the future. The phrase 'sustainable agriculture' was reportedly coined by the Australian  . The term became popular in the late 1980s.\nThere was an international symposium on sustainability in horticulture by the International Society of Horticultural Science at the International Horticultural Congress in Toronto in 2002. At the following conference at Seoul in 2006 the principles were discussed further.\nIn the US National Agricultural Research, Extension, and Teaching Policy Act of 1977, the term \"sustainable agriculture\" is defined as an integrated system of plant and animal production practices having a site-specific application that will, over the long term:\nThe British scholar Jules Pretty has stated several key principles associated with sustainability in agriculture:\nIt \u201cconsiders long-term as well as short-term economics because sustainability is readily defined as forever, that is, agricultural environments that are designed to promote endless regeneration\u201d. It balances the need for resource conservation with the needs of  pursuing their .\nIt is considered to be , accommodating biodiversity within human landscapes.\nThere is debate on the definition of sustainability regarding agriculture. The definition could be characterized by two different approaches: an ecocentric approach and a technocentric approach. The ecocentric approach emphasizes no- or low-growth levels of human development, and focuses on  and  techniques with the goal of changing consumption patterns, and resource allocation and usage. The technocentric approach argues that  can be attained through a variety of strategies, from the view that state-led modification of the industrial system like conservation-oriented farming systems should be implemented, to the argument that  is the best way to meet the increasing demand for food.\nOne can look at the topic of sustainable agriculture through two different lenses: multifunctional agriculture and . Both of approaches are similar, but look at the function of agriculture differently. Those that employ the multifunctional agriculture philosophy focus on farm-centered approaches, and define function as being the outputs of agricultural activity. The central argument of multifunctionality is that agriculture is a multifunctional enterprise with other functions aside from the production of food and fiber. These functions include renewable resource management, landscape conservation and biodiversity. The ecosystem service-centered approach posits that individuals and society as a whole receive benefits from , which are called \"ecosystem services\". In sustainable agriculture, the services that ecosystems provide include , , and , all of which are necessary functions for the production of food.\nIt is also claimed sustainable agriculture is best considered as an ecosystem approach to agriculture, called .\nMost agricultural professionals agree that there is a \"moral obligation to pursue [the] goal [of] sustainability.\" The major debate comes from what system will provide a path to that goal because if an unsustainable method is used on a large scale it will have a massive negative effect on the environment and human population. \nPractices that can cause long-term damage to  include excessive  of the soil (leading to ) and  without adequate drainage (leading to ).\nThe most important factors for a farming site are , soil,  and . Of the four, water and  are the most amenable to human intervention.\nWhen farmers grow and harvest crops, they remove some nutrients from the soil. Without replenishment, land suffers from  and becomes either unusable or suffers from reduced . Sustainable agriculture depends on replenishing the soil while minimizing the use or need of non-renewable resources, such as  or mineral ores.\nA farm that is able to \"produce perpetually\", yet has negative effects on environmental quality elsewhere is not sustainable agriculture. An example of a case in which a global view may be warranted is application of  or , which can improve productivity of a farm but can pollute nearby rivers and coastal waters (). The other extreme can also be undesirable, as the problem of low crop yields due to exhaustion of nutrients in the soil has been related to  destruction. In Asia, the specific amount of land needed for sustainable farming is about 12.5 acres which includes land for animal fodder, cereal production as cash crop and other food crops. In some cases, a small unit of aquaculture is included (AARI-1996).\nPossible sources of  that would, in principle, be available indefinitely, include:\nThe last option was proposed in the 1970s, but is only gradually becoming feasible. Sustainable options for replacing other nutrient inputs such as phosphorus and potassium are more limited.\nOther options include , returning to natural cycles that annually flood cultivated lands (returning lost nutrients) such as the , the long-term use of , and use of crop and livestock  that are adapted to less than ideal conditions such as pests, drought, or lack of nutrients. Crops that require high levels of soil nutrients can be cultivated in a more sustainable manner with appropriate fertilizer management practices.\n is a primary component in . It is the second most important nutrient for plants after nitrogen, and is often a limiting factor. It is important for sustainable agriculture as it can improve soil fertility and crop yields. Phosphorus is involved in all major metabolic processes including photosynthesis, energy transfer, signal transduction, macromolecular biosynthesis, and respiration. It is needed for root ramification and strength and seed formation, and can increase disease resistance.\nPhosphorus is found in the soil in both inorganic and organic forms and makes up approximately 0.05% of soil biomass. Phosphorus fertilizers are the main input of inorganic phosphorus in agricultural soils and approximately 70%\u201380% of phosphorus in cultivated soils is inorganic. Long-term use of phosphate-containing chemical fertilizers causes  and deplete soil microbial life, so people have looked to other sources.\nPhosphorus fertilizers are manufactured from . However, rock phosphate is a non-renewable resource and it is being depleted by mining for agricultural use:  will occur within the next few hundred years, or perhaps earlier.\n is becoming a severe global problem. According to the : \"About a quarter of the Earth\u2019s ice-free land area is subject to human-induced degradation (medium confidence). Soil erosion from agricultural fields is estimated to be currently 10 to 20 times (no tillage) to more than 100 times (conventional tillage) higher than the soil formation rate (medium confidence).\" Over a billion tonnes of southern Africa's soil are being lost to erosion annually, which if continued will result in halving of crop yields within thirty to fifty years. Improper  is threatening the ability to grow sufficient food. Intensive agriculture reduces the  level in soil, impairing soil structure, crop growth and ecosystem functioning, and accelerating . \n\nSoil management techniques include ,  and  to reduce wind erosion,  into the soil, reducing , and preventing water run-off.\nAs the global population increases and demand for food increases, there is pressure on land as a resource. In land use planning and management, considering the impacts of land use changes on factors such as soil erosion can support long-term agricultural sustainability, as shown by a study of Wadi Ziqlab, a dry area in the Middle East where farmers graze livestock and grow olives, vegetables, and grains.\nLooking back over the 20th century shows that for people in poverty, following environmentally sound land practices has not always been a viable option due to many complex and challenging life circumstances. Currently, increased  in developing countries may be connected with rural poverty among smallholder farmers when forced into unsustainable agricultural practices out of necessity.\nLand is a finite resource on Earth. Although expansion of agricultural land can decrease  and contribute to , the picture is complex; for instance, a study examining the introduction of sheep by Norse settlers (Vikings) to the Faroe Islands of the North Atlantic concluded that, over time, the fine partitioning of land plots contributed more to soil erosion and degradation than grazing itself.\nThe  of the United Nations estimates that in coming decades, cropland will continue to be lost to industrial and , along with reclamation of wetlands, and conversion of forest to cultivation, resulting in the  and increased soil erosion.\nIn modern agriculture, energy is used in on-farm mechanisation, food processing, storage, and transportation processes. It has therefore been found that energy prices are closely linked to food prices. Oil is also used as an input in agricultural chemicals. The  projects higher prices of non-renewable energy resources as a result of fossil fuel resources being depleted. It may therefore decrease global  unless action is taken to 'decouple' fossil fuel energy from food production, with a move towards 'energy-smart' agricultural systems including .\nThe use of solar powered irrigation in  is said to be a closed system for agricultural water irrigation.\nThe environmental cost of transportation could be avoided if people use local products.\nIn some areas sufficient  is available for crop growth, but many other areas require . For irrigation systems to be sustainable, they require proper management (to avoid ) and must not use more water from their source than is naturally replenishable. Otherwise, the water source effectively becomes a . Improvements in water  technology and , combined with the development of  and low-pressure pivots, have made it possible to regularly achieve high crop yields in areas where reliance on rainfall alone had previously made successful agriculture unpredictable. However, this progress has come at a price. In many areas, such as the , the water is being used faster than it can be replenished.\nAccording to the UC Davis Agricultural Sustainability Institute, several steps must be taken to develop drought-resistant farming systems even in \"normal\" years with average rainfall. These measures include both policy and management actions:\nIndicators for sustainable water resource development include the average annual flow of rivers from rainfall, flows from outside a country, the percentage of water coming from outside a country, and gross water withdrawal.\nCosts, such as environmental problems, not covered in traditional  systems (which take into account only the direct costs of production incurred by the farmer) are known as .\nNetting studied sustainability and  in  systems through history.\nThere are several studies incorporating externalities such as ecosystem services, biodiversity, land degradation and  in economic analysis. These include  study and the  which seek to establish an economic cost-benefit analysis on the practice of sustainable land management and sustainable agriculture.\n frameworks include social and environmental alongside a financial bottom line. A sustainable future can be feasible if growth in material consumption and population is slowed down and if there is a drastic increase in the efficiency of material and energy use. To make that transition, long- and short-term goals will need to be balanced enhancing  and quality of life.\nOther practices includes growing a diverse number of perennial crops in a single field, each of which would grow in separate season so as not to compete with each other for natural resources. This system would result in increased resistance to diseases and decreased effects of erosion and loss of nutrients in soil.  from legumes, for example, used in conjunction with plants that rely on nitrate from soil for growth, helps to allow the land to be reused annually. Legumes will grow for a season and replenish the soil with ammonium and nitrate, and the next season other plants can be seeded and grown in the field in preparation for harvest.\nSustainable methods of weed management may help reduce the development of herbicide-resistant weeds.  may also replenish nitrogen if  are used in the rotations and may also use resources more efficiently.\nThere are also many ways to practice sustainable . Some of the tools to  management include fencing off the grazing area into smaller areas called , lowering stock density, and moving the stock between paddocks frequently.\nAn increased production is a goal of . Sustainable intensification encompasses specific agriculture methods that increase production and at the same time help improve environmental outcomes. The desired outcomes of the farm are achieved without the need for more land cultivation or destruction of natural habitat; the system performance is upgraded with no net environmental cost. Sustainable Intensification has become a priority for the United Nations. Sustainable intensification differs from prior intensification methods by specifically placing importance on broader environmental outcomes. By the year 2018; it was predicted in 100 nations a combined total of 163 million farms used sustainable intensification. The amount of agricultural land covered by this is 453 million ha of land. That amount of land is equal to 29% of farms worldwide. In light of concerns about ,  growth and dwindling land suitable for agriculture, sustainable intensive farming practises are needed to maintain high , while maintaining  and . The capacity for ecosystem services to be strong enough to allow a reduction in use of non-renewable inputs whilst maintaining or boosting yields has been the subject of much debate. Recent work in irrigated rice production system of east Asia has suggested that - in relation to pest management at least - promoting the ecosystem service of biological control using nectar plants can reduce the need for insecticides by 70% whilst delivering a 5% yield advantage compared with standard practice.\n is a concept with the potential advantages of year-round production, isolation from pests and diseases, controllable resource recycling and reduced transportation costs.\n can be improved by reducing the need for  and using alternative methods. Such methods includes: researching on  resistant crops, monitoring plant  and reducing soil .\nDrought resistant crops have been researched extensively as a means to overcome the issue of . They are  so they can adapt in an environment with little water. This is beneficial as it reduces the need for irrigation and helps conserve water. Although they have been extensively researched, significant results have not been achieved as most of the successful species will have no overall impact on water conservation. However, some grains like , for example, have been successfully genetically modified to be drought resistant.\n include using compost from recycling centers. Using compost from yard and kitchen waste uses available resources in the area.\nAbstinence from soil  before planting and leaving the plant residue after  reduces soil water evaporation; It also serves to prevent soil erosion.\nCrop residues left covering the surface of the soil may result in reduced evaporation of water, a lower surface soil temperature and reduction of wind effects.\nA way to make  more effective is to add microbial inoculates such as phosphate-solubilizing microorganisms, known as PSMs, to the soil. These solubilize phosphorus already in the soil and use processes like organic acid production and ion exchange reactions to make that phosphorus available for plants. Experimentally, these PSMs have been shown to increase crop growth in terms of shoot height, dry biomass and grain yield.\nPhosphorus uptake is even more efficient with the presence of  in the soil. Mycorrhiza is a type of  association between plants and fungi, which are well-equipped to absorb nutrients, including phosphorus, in soil. These fungi can increase nutrient uptake in soil where phosphorus has been fixed by aluminum, calcium, and iron. Mycorrhizae can also release organic acids that solubilize otherwise unavailable phosphorus.\n can be used as an alternative to chemicals for soil sterilization. Different methods are available to induce steam into the soil in order to kill pests and increase soil health.\nSolarizing is based on the same principle, used to increase the temperature of the soil to kill pathogens and pests.\nCertain plants can be cropped for use as , \"natural\" , releasing pest suppressing compounds when crushed, ploughed into the soil, and covered in plastic for four weeks. Plants in the  family release large amounts of toxic compounds such as .\nSustainability may also involve . Crop rotation and  prevent , by protecting  from wind and water. Effective crop rotation can reduce pest pressure on crops and replenish . This reduces the need for fertilizers and . Increasing the diversity of crops by introducing new genetic resources can increase yields.  crops reduce the need for  and thus help mitigate soil erosion, and may sometimes tolerate drought better, increase water quality and help increase soil organic matter. There are research programs attempting to develop perennial substitutes for existing annual crops, such as replacing wheat with the wild grass , or possible experimental hybrids of it and wheat.\nOften thought of as inherently destructive,  or   have been practised in the Amazon for thousands of years.\nSome traditional systems combine  with sustainability. In South-East Asia,  on  have raised  as well as rice, producing an additional product and reducing  of neighbouring rivers. A variant in Indonesia combines rice, fish, ducks and water fern; the ducks eat the weeds that would otherwise limit rice growth, saving labour and herbicides, while the duck and fish manure substitute for fertilizer. \nRaised field agriculture has been recently revived in certain areas of the world, such as the  region in  and . This has resurged in the form of traditional  raised fields, which create nutrient rich soil in regions where such soil is scarce. This method is extremely productive, and has recently been utilized by indigenous groups in the area and the nearby  in order to make use of lands that have been historically hard to cultivate.\nIn Ohio, some farmers that could not buy land good for agriculture, restored soil considered as unsuitable for any agricultural activity with traditional methods\nThe use of available city space (e.g., , , , and other forms of ) may be able to contribute to sustainability.\nThere is limited evidence  may contribute to sustainable agriculture. A meta-analysis of a number of polycrop studies found that predator insect biodiversity was higher at comparable yields than conventional in certain  with a single  combined with a cover crop.\nOne approach to sustainability is to develop polyculture systems using perennial crop varieties. Such varieties are being developed for rice, wheat, sorghum, barley, and sunflowers. If these can be combined in polyculture with a leguminous cover crop such as alfalfa, fixation of nitrogen will be added to the system, reducing the need for fertilizer and pesticides.\nOrganic agriculture can be defined as:\nan integrated farming system that strives for sustainability, the enhancement of soil fertility and biological diversity whilst, with rare exceptions, prohibiting synthetic pesticides, antibiotics, synthetic fertilizers, genetically modified organisms, and growth hormones.Some claim  may produce the most sustainable products available for consumers in the US, where no other alternatives exist, although the focus of the organics industry is not sustainability.\nIn 2018 the sales of organic products in USA reach $52.5 billion According to a big survey two thirds of Americans consume organic products at least occasionally\nRegenerative agriculture is a conservation and rehabilitation approach to food and farming systems. It focuses on  , increasing , improving the , enhancing , supporting , increasing resilience to , and strengthening the health and vitality of farm soil. Practices include, recycling as much farm waste as possible, and adding  material from sources outside the farm.\n does not share the philosophical base as indicated by the title of the 2002 publication .\nIn 2007, the  reported on \" and  in Africa\", stating that using sustainable agriculture could be a tool in reaching global food security without expanding land usage and reducing . There has been evidence provided by developing nations from the early 2000s stating that when people in their communities are not factored into the agricultural process that serious harm is done. The  Charles Kellogg has stated that, \"In a final effort, exploited people pass their suffering to the land.\" Sustainable agriculture mean the ability to permanently and continuously \"feed its constituent populations.\"\nThere are a lot of opportunities that can increase farmers\u2019 profits, improve communities, and continue sustainable practices. For example, in   were originally illegal, however, with the stress of banana crisis in Uganda where  had the potential to wipe out 90% of yield they decided to explore GMOs as a possible solution. The government issued the National Biotechnology and Biosafety bill which will allow scientists that are part of the National Banana Research Program to start experimenting with genetically modified organisms. This effort has the potential to help local communities because a significant portion  and it will be  because the yield of their main produce will remain stable.\nNot all regions are suitable for agriculture. The technological advancement of the past few decades has allowed agriculture to develop in some of these regions. For example, Nepal has built  to deal with its high altitude and mountainous regions. Greenhouses allow for greater crop production and also use less water since they are closed systems.\n techniques can turn salt water into fresh water which allows greater access to water for areas with a limited supply. This allows the irrigation of crops without decreasing natural fresh water sources. While desalination can be a tool to provide water to areas that need it to sustain agriculture, it requires money and resources. Regions of China have been considering large scale desalination in order to increase access to water, but the current cost of the desalination process makes it impractical.\nWomen working in sustainable agriculture come from numerous backgrounds, from academic and labour. In the past 30 years (1978-2007) in the  the number of women farm operators has tripled. Today, women operate 14 percent of farms, compared to five percent in 1978. Much of the growth is due to women farming outside the \"male dominated field of conventional agriculture\".\nSustainable agriculture is a topic in international policy concerning its potential to reduce environmental risks. In 2011, the Commission on Sustainable Agriculture and Climate Change, as part of its recommendations for policy makers on achieving food security in the face of climate change, urged that sustainable agriculture must be integrated into national and international policy. The Commission stressed that increasing weather variability and climate shocks will negatively affect agricultural yields, necessitating early action to drive change in agricultural production systems towards increasing resilience. It also called for dramatically increased investments in sustainable agriculture in the next decade, including in national research and development budgets, , economic incentives, and infrastructure improvement.\nIn the United States, the federal USDA-Natural Resources Conservation Service provides technical and financial assistance for those interested in pursuing natural resource conservation along with production agriculture.\nOne of the most important projects to mitigate climate change with agriculture and adapting agriculture to climate change at the same time, was launched in 2019 by the \"Global EverGreening Alliance\". The initiative was announced in the . One of the main methods is . Another important method is . One of the targets is to sequester carbon from the atmosphere. By 2050 the restored land should sequestrate 20 billion tonnes of carbon annually. The coalition wants, among other, to recover with trees a territory of 5.75 million square kilometres, achieve a health tree - grass balance on a territory of 6.5 million square kilometres and increase carbon capture in a territory of 5 million square kilometres.\nThe first phase is the \"Grand African Savannah Green Up\" project. Already millions families implemented these methods, and the average territory covered with trees in the farms in  increased to 16%.\nThe Alliance work on the issue of sustainable agriculture since 2012\nAmong 63 farmers interviewed in  most accepted the notion climate change was happening, but just a small segment believed that it was human related. Few farmers thought that the issue of climate change was significant enough to diminish what was causing it. Some of the farmers were worried about how a suggested carbon dioxide reduction plan would affect the agricultural sector and were suspicious of numerous government related activities, seeing them as methods in which the government could punish producers. The author James Howard Kunstler claims almost all modern technology is bad and that there cannot be sustainability unless agriculture is done in ancient traditional ways. Efforts toward more sustainable agriculture are supported in the sustainability community, however, these are often viewed only as incremental steps and not as an end. Some foresee a true sustainable  that may be very different from today's: greatly reduced energy usage, minimal , fewer ,  with , little , more home and , etc.\nAccording to Michael Carolan, a major barrier to the adoption of sustainable agriculture is its appearance of a lack of benefits. Many benefits are not visible or immediately evident, and affecting changes such as lower rates of soil and  loss, improved  and higher levels of beneficial  takes time. In  the benefits are easily visible with no weeds, pests, etc. and the costs to soil and  around it are hidden and \"externalised\".\n\u00a0This article incorporates text from a  work.

The modern  has attempted to solve the problem in a large variety of ways. But little progress has been made, as shown by severe  overshoot and lack of sufficient progress on the  problem. Something within the human system is preventing change to a sustainable mode of behavior. That system trait is . Change resistance is also known as organizational resistance, barriers to change, or policy resistance.\nWhile environmentalism had long been a minor force in political change, the movement strengthened significantly in the 1970s with the first  in 1970, in which over 20 million people participated, with publication of  in 1972, and with the first  in Stockholm in 1972. Early expectations the problem could be solved ran high. 114 out of 132 members of the United Nations attended the Stockholm conference. The conference was widely seen at the time as a harbinger of success:\nHowever, despite the work of a worldwide , many national environmental protection agencies, creation of the , and many international environmental treaties, the sustainability problem continues to grow worse. The latest  data shows the world's footprint increased from about 50%  in 1961 to 50%  in 2007, the last year data is available.\nIn 1972 the first edition of  analyzed the environmental sustainability problem using a  model. The widely influential book predicted that:\nYet thirty-two years later in 2004 the third edition reported that:\nChange resistance runs so high that the world's top two greenhouse gas emitters,  and the , have never adopted the  treaty. In the US resistance was so strong that in 1999 the US Senate voted 95 to zero against the treaty by passing the , despite the fact  was vice-president at the time. Not a single senator could be persuaded to support the treaty, which has not been brought back to the floor since.\nDue to prolonged change resistance, the climate change problem has escalated to the climate change crisis.  emissions are rising much faster than  models expected: \u201cThe growth rate of [fossil fuel] emissions was 3.5% per year for 2000-2007, an almost four fold increase from 0.9% per year in 1990-1999. \u2026 This makes current trends in emissions higher than the worst case IPCC-SRES scenario.\u201d \nThe  of December 2009 ended in failure. No agreement on binding targets was reached. The  in December 2010 did not break the deadlock. The best it could do was another non-binding agreement:\nThis indicates no progress at all since 1992, when the  was created at the  in . The 2010 Cancun agreement was the functional equivalent of what the 1992 agreement said:\nNegotiations have bogged down so pervasively that: \u201cClimate policy is gridlocked, and there\u2019s virtually no chance of a breakthrough.\u201d  \u201cClimate policy, as it has been understood and practised by many governments of the world under the Kyoto Protocol approach, has failed to produce any discernible real world reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases in fifteen years.\u201d \nThese events suggest that change resistance to solving the sustainability problem is so high the problem is currently unsolvable.\nUnderstanding change resistance requires seeing it as a distinct and separate part of the sustainability problem. Tanya Markvart's 2009 thesis on  stated that:\nThe thesis focuses specifically on developing \u201can interdisciplinary theoretical framework for understanding institutional change and resistance to change towards sustainability.\u201d\nJack Harich's 2010 paper on  argues there are two separate problems to solve. A  and a  model were used to explain how:\nThe paper discussed the two subproblems:\nThe proper coupling subproblem is what most people consider as \u201cthe\u201d problem to solve. It is called  in economic and environmental fields, where the term refers to economic growth without additional environmental degradation. Solving the proper coupling problem is the goal of environmentalism and in particular : \u201cEcological economics is the study of the interactions and co-evolution in time and space of human economies and the ecosystems in which human economies are embedded.\u201d \nChange resistance is also called barriers to change. Hoffman and Bazerman, in a chapter on \u201cUnderstanding and overcoming the organizational and psychological barriers to action,\u201d concluded that:\n, current leader of the system dynamics school of thought, came to the same conclusion:\nThese findings indicate there are at least two subproblems to be solved: change resistance and proper coupling. Given the human system's long history of unsuccessful attempts to self-correct to a sustainable mode, it appears that high change resistance is preventing proper coupling. This may be expressed as an emerging principle: systemic change resistance is the crux of the sustainability problem and must be solved first, before the human system can be properly coupled to the greater system it lives within, the environment.\nSystemic change resistance differs significantly from individual change resistance. \u201cSystemic means originating from the system in such a manner as to affect the behavior of most or all social agents of certain types, as opposed to originating from individual agents.\u201d  Individual change resistance originates from individual people and organizations. How the two differ may be seen in this passage:\nIf sources of systemic change resistance are present, they are the principal cause of individual change resistance. According to the  it is crucial to address systemic change resistance when present and avoid assuming that change resistance can be overcome by bargaining, reasoning, inspirational appeals, and so on. This is because:\n, a thought leader of  for the business world, describes the structural source of systemic change resistance as being due to an \u201cimplicit system goal:\u201d \nSenge's insight applies to the sustainability problem. Until the \u201cimplicit system goal\u201d causing systemic change resistance is found and resolved, change efforts to solve the proper coupling part of the sustainability problem may be, as Senge argues, \u201cdoomed to failure.\u201d\nPresently environmentalism is focused on solving the proper coupling subproblem. For example, the following are all proper coupling solutions. They attempt to solve the direct cause of the sustainability problem's symptoms:\nThe direct cause of environmental impact is the three factors on the right side of the  where mpact equals opulation times ffluence (consumption per person) times echnology (environmental impact per unit of consumption). It is these three factors that solutions like those listed above seek to reduce.\nThe top environmental organization in the world, the  (UNEP), focuses exclusively on proper coupling solutions:\nThe six areas are all direct practices to reduce the three factors of the I=PAT equation.\n' 2006 documentary film  described the climate change problem and the urgency of solving it. The film concluded with Gore saying:\nThe four solutions Gore mentions are proper coupling practices. There is, however, a hint of acknowledgement that overcoming systemic change resistance is the real challenge, when Gore says \u201c...we just have to have the determination to make it happen. We have everything that we need to reduce carbon emissions, everything but political will.\u201d\nThe twenty-seven solutions that appear during the film's closing credits are mostly proper coupling solutions. The first nine are:\nSome solutions are attempts to overcome individual change resistance, such as:\nHowever none of the twenty-seven solutions deal with overcoming systemic change resistance.\nEfforts here are sparse because environmentalism is currently not oriented toward treating systemic change resistance as a distinct and separate problem to solve.\nOn how to specifically overcome the change resistance subproblem, Markvart examined two leading theories that seemed to offer insight into change resistance,  theory and , and concluded that:\nTaking a  and  modeling approach, Harich carefully defined the three characteristics of a  and then found a main systemic root cause for both the change resistance and proper coupling subproblems. Several sample solution elements for resolving the root causes were suggested. The point was made that the exact solution policies chosen do not matter nearly as much as finding the correct systemic root causes. Once these are found, how to resolve them is relatively obvious because once a root cause is found by structural modeling, the high leverage point for resolving it follows easily. Solutions may then push on specific structural points in the social system, which due to careful modeling will have fairly predictable effects.\nThis reaffirms the work of , as expressed in her classic essay on . The final page stated that:\nHere Meadows refers to the leverage point for resolving the proper coupling subproblem rather than the leverage point for overcoming change resistance. This is because the current focus of environmentalism is on proper coupling.\nHowever, if the leverage points associated with the root causes of change resistance exist and can be found, the system will not resist changing them. This is an important principle of social system behavior.\nFor example, Harich found the main root cause of successful systemic change resistance to be high \"deception effectiveness.\" The source was special interests, particularly large for-profit corporations. The high leverage point was raising \"general ability to detect manipulative deception.\" This can be done with a variety of solution elements, such as \"The Truth Test.\" This effectively increases truth literacy, just as conventional education raises reading and writing . Few citizens resist literacy education because its benefits have become so obvious.\nPromotion of  (CSR) has been used to try to overcome change resistance to solving social problems, including environmental sustainability. This solution strategy has not worked well because it is voluntary and does not resolve root causes.  explained why CSR fails: \"The social responsibility of business is to increase profits.\"  Business cannot be responsible to society. It can only be responsible to its shareholders.\n"},

Consumption refers not only to individuals and households, but also to governments, business, and other institutions. Sustainable consumption is closely related to sustainable production and sustainable lifestyles. \"A sustainable lifestyle minimizes ecological impacts while enabling a flourishing life for individuals, households, communities, and beyond. It is the product of individual and collective decisions about aspirations and about satisfying needs and adopting practices, which are in turn conditioned, facilitated, and constrained by societal norms, political institutions, public policies, infrastructures, markets, and culture.\". \nSustainable Consumption, then, would also include analyses of efficiency, infrastructure, and waste, as well as access to basic services, green and decent jobs and a better quality of life for all. It shares a number of common features with and is closely linked to the terms  and . Sustainable consumption as part of  is a prerequisite in the worldwide struggle against  challenges such as , , famines or .\nSustainable development as well as sustainable consumption rely on certain premises such as:\nThe definition proposed by the 1994 Oslo Symposium on Sustainable Consumption defines it as \"the use of services and related products which respond to basic needs and bring a better  while minimizing the use of natural resources and toxic materials as well as emissions of waste and pollutants over the life cycle of the service or product so as not to jeopardize the needs of future generations.\"\nIn order to achieve sustainable consumption, two developments have to take place: it requires both an increase in the efficiency of consumption as well as a change in consumption patterns and reductions in consumption levels in industrialized countries as well as rich social classes in developing countries which have also a large ecological footprint and give examples for increasing middle classes in developing countries. The first prerequisite is not sufficient on its own and can be named weak sustainable consumption. Here, technological improvements and  support a necessary reduction in . Once this aim has been met, the second prerequisite, the change in patterns and reduction of levels of consumption is indispensable. Strong sustainable consumption approaches also pay attention to the social dimension of  and assess the need for changes based on a risk-averse perspective. In order to achieve what can be termed strong sustainable consumption, changes in infrastructures as well as the choices customers have are required. In the political arena, weak sustainable consumption has been discussed whereas strong sustainable consumption is missing from all debates.\nThe so-called  or  describes a significant obstacle to changes in individual customer behavior. Many consumers are well aware of the importance of their consumption choices and care about environmental issues, however, most of them do not translate their concerns into their consumption patterns as the purchase-decision making process is highly complicated and relies on e.g. social, political and psychological factors. Young et al. identified a lack of time for research, high prices, a lack of information and the cognitive effort needed as the main barriers when it comes to  choices.\n"},
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_design", "title": "SustainabledesignWikipedia", "body": " (also called environmentally conscious design, eco design, etc.) is the philosophy of designing physical objects, the built environment, and services to comply with the principles of  .\nThe intention of sustainable design is to \"eliminate negative environmental impact completely through skillful, sensitive design\". Manifestations of sustainable design require , impact the environment minimally, and connect people with the natural environment.\n\u201cHuman beings don't have a pollution problem; they have a design problem. If humans were to devise products, tools, furniture, homes, factories, and cities more intelligently from the start, they wouldn't even need to think in terms of waste, or contamination, or scarcity. Good design would allow for abundance, endless reuse, and pleasure.\u201d  - The Upcycle by authors  and , 2013.\nDesign-related decisions are happening everywhere on a daily basis, impacting \u201c\u201d or provisioning for the needs of future generations of life on earth.  and design are intimately linked. Quite simply, our future is designed. The term \u201cdesign\u201d is here used to refer to practices applied to the making of products, services, as well as business and innovation strategy\u200a\u2014\u200aall of which inform sustainability. Sustainability can be thought of as the property of continuance; that is, what is sustainable can be continued into the future.\nThe principle that all directions of progress run out, ending with diminishing returns, is evident in the typical 'S' curve of the  and in the useful life of any system as discussed in  and .  Diminishing returns are the result of reaching natural limits.  Common business management practice is to read diminishing returns in any direction of effort as an indication of diminishing opportunity, the potential for accelerating decline and a signal to seek new opportunities elsewhere. (see also: ,  and .)\nA problem arises when the limits of a resource are hard to see, so increasing investment in response to diminishing returns may seem profitable as in the , but may lead to a collapse.  This problem of increasing investment in diminishing resources has also been studied in relation to the causes of civilization collapse by  among others. This natural error in investment policy contributed to the collapse of both the  and , among others. Relieving over-stressed resources requires reducing pressure on them, not continually increasing it whether more efficiently or not.\n\nThe designer is responsible for choices that place a demand on natural resources, produce waste, and potentially cause irreversible ecosystem damage.\nAbout 80 million tonnes of waste in total are generated in the U.K. alone, for example, each year. And with reference to only household waste, between 1991/92 and 2007/08, each person in England generated an average of 1.35 pounds of waste per day.\nExperience has now shown that there is no completely safe method of waste disposal. All forms of disposal have negative effects on the environment, public innovation, and local economies. Landfills have contaminated drinking water. Garbage burned in incinerators has poisoned air, soil, and water. The majority of water treatment systems change the local ecology. Attempts to control or manage wastes after they are produced fail to eliminate environmental impacts.\nThe toxics components of household products pose serious health risks and aggravate the trash problem. In the U.S., about seven pounds in every ton of household garbage contains toxic materials, such as  like , , , and  from batteries, and  found in pesticides and consumer products, such as  sprays, , cleaners, and other products. When burned or buried, toxic materials also pose a serious threat to public health and the environment.\nThe only way to avoid environmental harm from waste is to prevent its generation.  means changing the way activities are conducted and eliminating the source of the problem. It does not mean doing without, but doing differently. For example, preventing waste pollution from litter caused by disposable beverage containers does not mean doing without beverages; it just means using refillable bottles.\nIndustrial designer Victor  has stated that when we design and plan things to be discarded, we exercise insufficient care in design. \n\nIn planning for facilities, a comprehensive design strategy is needed for preventing the generation of . A good garbage prevention strategy would require that everything brought into a facility is recycled for reuse or recycled back into the environment through . This would mean a greater reliance on natural materials or products that are compatible with the environment.\nAny resource-related development is going to have two basic sources of solid waste \u2014 materials purchased and used by the facility and those brought into the facility by visitors. The following waste prevention strategies apply to both, although different approaches will be needed for implementation:\nPerhaps the most obvious and overshadowing driver of environmentally conscious sustainable design can be attributed to  and climate change. The sense of urgency that now prevails for humanity to take actions against climate change has increased manifold in the past thirty years. Climate change can be attributed to several faults, and improper design that doesn't take into consideration the environment is one of them. While several steps in the field of sustainability have begun, most products, industries and buildings still consume a lot of energy and create a lot of pollution.\nUnsustainable environment design, or simply design, also affects the biodiversity of a region. Improper design of transport highways force thousands of animals to move further into forest boundaries. Poorly designed hydrothermal dams affect the mating cycle and indirectly, the numbers of local fish.\nWhile the practical application varies among disciplines, some common principles are as follows:\nA model of the new design principles necessary for  is exemplified by the \"Bill of Rights for the Planet\" or \"Hannover Principles\" -  developed by William McDonough Architects for EXPO 2000 that was held in .\nThese principles were adopted by the World Congress of the International Union of Architects (UIA) in June 1993 at the American Institute of Architects' (AIA) Expo 93 in . Further, the AIA and UIA signed a \"Declaration of Interdependence for a Sustainable Future.\" In summary, the declaration states that today's society is degrading its environment and that the AIA, UIA, and their members are committed to:\nIn addition, the Interprofessional Council on Environmental Design (ICED), a coalition of architectural, landscape architectural, and engineering organizations developed a vision statement in an attempt to foster a team approach to sustainable design. ICED states: The ethics, education and practices of our professions will be directed to shape a sustainable future. . . . To achieve this vision we will join . . . as a multidisciplinary partnership.\"\nThese activities are an indication that the concept of sustainable design is being supported on a global and interprofessional scale and that the ultimate goal is to become more environmentally responsive. The world needs facilities that are more energy-efficient and that promote conservation and recycling of natural and economic resources.\nEnvironmentally sustainable design is most beneficial when it works hand in hand with the other two counterparts of sustainable design \u2013 the economic and socially sustainable designs. These three terms are often coined under the title \u2018triple bottom line.\u2019\nIt is imperative that we think about value in not solely economic or financial terms, but also in relation to natural capital (the biosphere and earth's resources), social capital (the norms and networks that enable collective action), and human capital (the sum total of knowledge, experience, intellectual property, and labor available to society). The purely economic capital so many people and organizations strive for, and make decisions by, are often not conducive to these alternative forms of capital. For sustainable design, there is a need to reset how we, as inhabitants of the earth, think about value.\nIn some countries the term  is known as ,  or . , embraced  and social quality and ecological quality, but did not explicitly combine these areas of design concern in one term.  and  are more common terms, including the  (people, planet and profit).\nIn the EU, the concept of sustainable design is referred to as ecodesign. Little discussions have taken place over the importance of this concept in the run-up to the  package, that the European Commission will be tabling by the end of 2015. To this effect, an Ecothis.EU campaign was launched to raise awareness about the economic and environmental consequences of not including eco-design as part of the circular economy package.\nAccording to  of , USA, emotionally durable design reduces the consumption and waste of  by increasing the resilience of relationships established between consumers and products.\" Essentially, product replacement is delayed by strong emotional ties. In his book, , Chapman describes how \"the process of consumption is, and has always been, motivated by complex emotional drivers, and is about far more than just the mindless purchasing of newer and shinier things; it is a journey towards the ideal or desired self, that through cyclical loops of desire and disappointment, becomes a seemingly endless process of serial destruction\". Therefore, a product requires an attribute, or number of attributes, which extend beyond utilitarianism.\nAccording to Chapman, 'emotional durability' can be achieved through consideration of the following five elements:\nAs a strategic approach, \"emotionally durable design provides a useful language to describe the contemporary relevance of designing responsible, well made, tactile products which the user can get to know and assign value to in the long-term.\" According to Hazel Clark and David Brody of  in New York, \u201cemotionally durable design is a call for professionals and students alike to prioritise the relationships between design and its users, as a way of developing more sustainable attitudes to, and in, design things.\u201d\nBecause standards of sustainable design appear to emphasize ethics over aesthetics, some designers and critics have complained that it lacks inspiration.  winner  has called green building \"bogus,\" and  winner  has dismissed it as \"having nothing to do with architecture.\" In 2009,  asked whether \"well-designed green architecture\" is an \"oxymoron.\"\nOthers claim that such criticism of sustainable design is misguided. A leading advocate for this alternative view is architect , whose book  (2012) was the first dedicated to the relationships between sustainability and beauty. Hosey argues not just that sustainable design needs to be aesthetically appealing in order to be successful, but also that following the principles of sustainability to their logical conclusion requires reimagining the shape of everything designed, creating things of even greater beauty. Reviewers have suggested that the ideas in  could \"revolutionize what it means to be sustainable.\" Small and large buildings are beginning to successfully incorporate principles of sustainability into award-winning designs. Examples include  and the . The popular  has incorporated beauty as one of its petals in building design. Sustainable products and processes are required to be beautiful because it allows for emotional durability.\nMany people also argue that biophilia is innately beautiful. Which is why building architecture is designed such that people feel close to nature and is often surrounded by well-kept lawns \u2013 a design that is both \u2018beautiful\u2019 and encourages the inculcation of nature in our daily lives. Or utilizes daylight design into the system \u2013 reducing lighting loads while also fulfilling our need for being close to that which is outdoors.\nDiscussed above, economics is another aspect of it environmental design that is crucial to most design decisions. It is obvious that most people consider the cost of any design before they consider the environmental impacts of it. Therefore, there is a growing nuance of pitching ideas and suggestions for environmentally sustainable design by highlighting the economical profits that they bring to us. \n\"As the green design field matures, it becomes ever more clear that integration is the key to achieving energy and environmental goals especially if cost is a major driver.\" Building Green Inc. (1999)\nTo achieve the more ambitious goals of the green design movement, architects, engineers and designers need to further embrace and communicate the profit and economic potential of sustainable design measures. Focus should be on honing skills in communicating the economic and profit potential of smart design, with the same rigor that have been applied to advancing technical building solutions.\nThere are several standards and rating systems developed as sustainability gains popularity. Most rating systems revolve around buildings and energy, and some cover products as well. Most rating systems certify on the basis of design as well as post construction or manufacturing. \nWhile designing for environmental sustainability, it is imperative that the appropriate units are paid attention to. Often, different standards weigh things in different units, and that can make a huge impact on the outcome of the project. \nAnother important aspect of using standards and looking at data involves understanding the baseline. A poor design baseline with huge improvements often show a higher efficiency percentage, while an intelligent baseline from the start might only have a little improvement needed and show lesser change. Therefore, all data should ideally be compared on similar levels, and also be looked at from multiple unit values.\nLife cycle assessment is the complete assessment of materials from their extraction, transport, processing, refining, manufacturing, maintenance, use, disposal, reuse and recycle stages. It helps put into perspective whether a design is actually environmentally sustainable in the long run. Products such as aluminum which can be reused multiple number of times but have a very energy intensive mining and refining which makes it unfavorable. Information such as this is done using LCA and then taken into consideration when designing.\nApplications of this philosophy range from the  \u2014 small objects for everyday use, through to the  \u2014 buildings, cities, and the Earth's physical surface. It is a philosophy that can be applied in the fields of , , , , , , , ,  and .\nSustainable design is mostly a general reaction to global , the rapid growth of economic activity and human population, depletion of natural resources, damage to , and . In 2013, eco architecture writer  surveyed emergency and long-term sustainable housing projects that were developed in response to these crises in her book, \u201cUrgent Architecture: 40 Sustainable Housing Solutions for a Changing World.\u201d Featured projects focus on , sustainable design,  materials, , , and . Construction methods and materials include repurposed , ,  homes, and .\nThe limits of sustainable design are reducing. Whole earth impacts are beginning to be considered because growth in goods and services is consistently outpacing gains in efficiency. As a result, the net effect of sustainable design to date has been to simply improve the efficiency of rapidly increasing impacts.  The present approach, which focuses on the efficiency of delivering individual goods and services, does not solve this problem. The basic dilemmas include: the increasing complexity of efficiency improvements; the difficulty of implementing new technologies in societies built around old ones; that physical impacts of delivering goods and services are not localized, but are distributed throughout the economies; and that the scale of resource use is growing and not stabilizing.\nSustainable architecture is the design of . Sustainable architecture attempts to reduce the collective environmental impacts during the production of building components, during the construction process, as well as during the  of the building (heating, electricity use, carpet cleaning etc.) This design practice emphasizes efficiency of heating and cooling systems;  sources such as , appropriate building siting, reused or recycled building materials; on-site power generation - solar technology, ground source heat pumps, wind power;  for gardening, washing and  recharge; and on-site  such as  that filter and control stormwater runoff. This requires close cooperation of the design team, the architects, the engineers, and the client at all project stages, from site selection, scheme formation, material selection and procurement, to project implementation. This is also called a charrette. \nAppropriate building siting and smaller building footprints are vital to an environmentally sustainable design. Oftentimes, a building may be very well designed, and energy efficient but its location requires people to travel far back and forth \u2013 increasing pollution that may not be building produced but is directly as a result of the building anyway. \nSustainable architecture must also cover the building beyond its useful life. Its disposal or recycling aspects also come under the wing of sustainability. Often, modular buildings are better to take apart and less energy intensive to put together too. The waste from the demolition site must be disposed of correctly and everything that can be harvested and used again should be designed to be extricated from the structure with ease, preventing unnecessary wastage when decommissioning the building. \nAnother important aspect of sustainable architecture stems from the question of whether a structure is needed. Sometimes the best that can be done to make a structure sustainable is retrofitting or upgrading the building services and supplies instead of tearing it down. Abu Dhabi, for example has undergone and is undergoing major retrofitting to slash its energy and water consumption rather than demolishing and rebuilding new structures.\nSustainable architects design with  in mind. Sustainable vs  is the challenge that designs not only reflect  processes and uses but are powered by renewable energies and site specific resources. A test for sustainable design is \u2014 can the design function for its intended use without  \u2014 unplugged. This challenge suggests architects and planners design solutions that can function without pollution rather than just reducing pollution.  As technology progresses in architecture and design theories and as examples are built and tested, architects will soon be able to create not only passive, null-emission buildings, but rather be able to integrate the entire power system into the building design.  In 2004 the 59 home housing community, the , and a 60,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (5,600\u00a0m) integrated retail, commercial and residential building, the , were completed by architect  in , . The  is the first housing community worldwide in which every home, all 59, produce a positive energy balance.\nAn essential element of Sustainable Building Design is indoor environmental quality including air quality, illumination, thermal conditions, and acoustics. The integrated design of the indoor environment is essential and must be part of the integrated design of the entire structure. ASHRAE Guideline 10-2011 addresses the interactions among indoor environmental factors and goes beyond traditional standards.\nConcurrently, the recent movements of  and  promote a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops ,  and . This in contrast to  and  architecture, as well as leaning against solitary  and . Both trends started in the 1980s. The  is an award that recognizes efforts in New Urbanism and New Classical Architecture, and is endowed with a prize money twice as high as that of the modernist .\nGreen design has often been used interchangeably with environmentally sustainable design. There is a popular debate about this with several arguing that green design is in effect narrower than sustainable design, which takes into account a larger system. Green design focuses on the short term goals and while it is a worthy goal, a larger impact is possible using sustainable design. Another factor to be considered is that green design has been stigmatized by popular personalities such as Pritzker Architecture Prize winner Frank Gehry, but this branding hasn't reached sustainable design. A large part of that is because of how environmentally sustainable design is generally used hand in hand with economically sustainable design and socially sustainable design. Finally, green design is although unintentionally, often associated only with architecture while sustainable design has been considered under a much larger scope.\n is the process of designing or operating systems such that they use energy and resources sustainably, in other words, at a rate that does not compromise the natural environment, or the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\nCommon engineering focuses revolve around water supply, production, sanitation, cleaning up of pollution and waste sites, restoring natural habitats etc.\nAchieving a healthy and aesthetic environment for the occupants of a space is one of the basic rules in the art of . When applying focus onto the sustainable aspects of the art, Interior Design can incorporate the study and involvement of functionality, accessibility, and aesthetics to environmentally friendly materials. The integrated design of the indoor environment is essential and must be part of the integrated design of the entire structure.\nImproving the overall building performance through the reduction of negative impacts on the environment is the primary goal. Reducing consumption of non-renewable resources, minimizing waste and creating healthy, productive environments are the primary objectives of sustainability. Optimizing site potential, minimizing non-renewable energy consumption, using environmentally preferable products, protecting and conserving water, enhancing indoor environmental quality, and optimizing operational and maintenance practices are some of the primary principles. An essential element of Sustainable Building Design is indoor environmental quality including air quality, illumination, thermal conditions, and acoustic. Interior design, when done correctly, can harness the true power of sustainable architecture.\nSustainable Interior Design can be incorporated through various techniques: water efficiency, energy efficiency, using non-toxic, sustainable or recycled materials, using manufactured processes and producing products with more energy efficiency, building longer lasting and better functioning products, designing reusable and recyclable products, following the sustainable design standards and guidelines, and more. For example, a room with large windows to allow for maximum sunlight should have neutral colored interiors to help bounce the light around and increase comfort levels while reducing light energy requirement.\nInterior Designers must take types of paints, adhesives, and more into consideration during their designing and manufacturing phase so they do not contribute to harmful environmental factors. Choosing whether to use a wood floor to marble tiled floor or carpeted floor can reduce energy consumption by the level of insulation that they provide. Utilizing materials that can withhold 24-hour health care facilities, such as linoleum, scrubbable cotton wall coverings, recycled carpeting, low toxic adhesive, and more.\nFurthermore, incorporating sustainability can begin before the construction process begins. Purchasing items from sustainable local businesses, analyzing the longevity of a product, taking part in recycling by purchasing recycled materials, and more should be taken into consideration. Supporting local, sustainable businesses is the first step, as this not only increases the demand for sustainable products, but also reduces unsustainable methods. Traveling all over to find specific products or purchasing products from over seas contributes to carbon emissions in the atmosphere, pulling further away from the sustainable aspect. Once the products are found, it is important to check if the selection follows the  (C2C) method and they are also able to be reclaimed, recycled, and reused. Also paying close attention to energy-efficient products during this entire process contributes to the sustainability factors. The aesthetic of a space does not have to be sacrificed in order to achieve sustainable interior design. Every environment and space can incorporate materials and choices to reducing environmental impact, while still providing durability and functionality.\nThe mission to incorporate sustainable interior design into every aspect of life is slowly becoming a reality. The commercial Interior Design Association (IIDA) created the sustainability forum to encourage, support, and educate the design community and the public about sustainability. The Athena Sustainable Materials Institute ensures enabling smaller footprints by working with sustainability leaders in various ways in producing and consuming materials. Building Green considers themselves the most trusted voice for sustainable and healthy design, as they offer a variety of resources to dive deep into sustainability. Various acts, such as the Energy Policy Act (EPAct) of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007 have been revised and passed to achieve better efforts towards sustainable design. Federal efforts, such as the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding to the commitment of sustainable design and the Executive Order 13693 have also worked to achieve these concepts. Various guideline and standard documents have been published for the sake of sustainable interior design and companies like LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) are guiding and certifying efforts put into motion to contribute to the mission. When the thought of incorporating sustainable design into an interior's design is kept as a top goal for a designer, creating an overall healthy and environmentally friendly space can be achieved.\nSustainable design of cities is the task of designing and planning the outline of cities such that they have a low carbon footprint, have better air quality, rely on more sustainable sources of energy, and have a healthy relationship with the environment. Sustainable urban planning involves many disciplines, including architecture, engineering, biology, environmental science, materials science, law, transportation, technology, economic development, accounting and finance, and government, among others. This kind of planning also develops innovative and practical approaches to land use and its impact on natural resources.\nNew sustainable solutions for urban planning problems can include green buildings and housing, mixed-use developments, walkability, greenways and open spaces, alternative energy sources such as solar and wind, and transportation options. Good sustainable land use planning helps improve the welfare of people and their communities, shaping their urban areas and neighborhoods into healthier, more efficient spaces. Design and planning of neighbourhoods are a major challenge when creating a favourable urban environment. The challenge is based on the principles of integrated approach to different demands: social, architectural, artistic, economic, sanitary and hygienic. Social demands are aimed at constructing network and placing buildings in order to create favourable conditions for their convenient use. Architectural-artistic solutions are aimed at single spatial composition of an area with the surrounding landscape. Economic demands include rational utilization of area territories. Sanitary and hygienic demands are of more interest in terms of creating sustainable urban areas.\n is a category of sustainable design and  concerned with the planning and design of outdoor space.

People in many different capacities, from farmers to consumers, have shared this vision and contributed to it. Despite the diversity of people and perspectives, the following themes commonly weave through definitions of sustainable agriculture.\nThere are strenuous discussions \u2014 among others by the  sector and authorities \u2014 if existing pesticide protocols and methods of  adequately protect  and . Doubt has risen if these are sustainable, and if  would permit an efficient  with fewer , therefore reducing the damage to the .\nFor more information on the subject of sustainable agriculture: .\n,  and  can be designed for repair and disassembly (for recycling), and constructed from recyclable materials such as steel, aluminum and glass, and renewable materials, such as ,  and plastics from natural feedstocks. Careful selection of materials and manufacturing processes can often create products comparable in price and performance to non-. Even mild design efforts can greatly increase the sustainable content of manufactured items.\nSustainable technology in the energy sector is based on utilizing renewable sources of energy such as , , , , , and . Wind energy is the world's fastest growing energy source; it has been in use for centuries in  and more recently in the  and other nations. Wind energy is captured through the use of  that generate and transfer electricity for utilities, homeowners and remote villages. Solar power can be harnessed through , concentrating solar, or  and is also a rapidly growing energy source. Advancements in the technology and modifications to photovoltaics cells provide a more in depth untouched method for creating and producing solar power. Researchers have found a potential way to use the photogalvanic effect to transform sunlight into electric energy.\nThe availability, potential, and feasibility of primary renewable energy resources must be analyzed early in the planning process as part of a comprehensive energy plan. The plan must justify energy demand and supply and assess the actual costs and benefits to the local, regional, and global environments. Responsible energy use is fundamental to  and a sustainable future. Energy management must balance justifiable energy demand with appropriate energy supply. The process couples energy awareness, energy conservation, and energy efficiency with the use of primary renewable energy resources.\nSustainable manufacturing can be defined as the creation of a manufactured product through a concurrent improvement in the resulting effect on factory and product sustainability. The concept of sustainable manufacturing demands a renewed design of  in order to condition the related  on  and Factory operations.\nAdvantageous reasons for why companies might chose to sustainably manufacture either their products or use a sustainable manufacturing process are:\nSustainable water technologies have become an important industry segment with several companies now providing important and scalable solutions to supply water in a sustainable manner.\nBeyond the use of certain technologies, Sustainable Design in Water Management also consists very importantly in correct implementation of concepts. Among one of these principal concepts is the fact normally in developed countries 100% of water destined for consumption, that is not necessarily for drinking purposes, is of potable water quality. This concept of differentiating qualities of water for different purposes has been called \"fit-for-purpose\". This more rational use of water achieves several economies, that are not only related to water itself, but also the consumption of energy, as to achieve water of drinking quality can be extremely energy intensive for several reasons.\nSustainable technologies use less energy, fewer limited resources, do not deplete natural resources, do not directly or indirectly pollute the environment, and can be reused or recycled at the end of their useful life. They may also be technology that help identify areas of growth by giving feedback in terms of data or alerts allowed to be analyzed to improve environmental footprints. There is significant overlap with , which emphasizes the suitability of technology to the context, in particular considering the needs of people in developing countries. The most appropriate technology may not be the most sustainable one; and a sustainable technology may have high cost or maintenance requirements that make it unsuitable as an \"appropriate technology,\" as that term is commonly used.\n\u201cTechnology is deeply entrenched in our society; without it, society would immediately collapse. Moreover, technological changes can be perceived as easier to accomplish than lifestyle changes that might be required to solve the problems that we face.\u201d\nThe design of sustainable technology relies heavily on the flow of new information. Sustainable technology such as  systems and intelligent sensors reduce energy consumption and help conserve water. These systems are ones that have more fundamental changes, rather than just switching to simple sustainable designs. Such designing requires constant updates and evolutions, to ensure true environmental sustainability, because the concept of sustainability is ever changing \u2013 with regards to our relationship with the environment. A large part of designing sustainable technology involves giving control to the users for their comfort and operation. For example, dimming controls help people adjust the light levels to their comfort. Sectioned lighting and lighting controls let people manipulate their lighting needs without worrying about affecting others \u2013 therefore reducing lighting loads.\nThe precursor step to environmentally sustainable development must be a sustainable design. By definition, design is defined as purpose, planning, or intention that exists or is thought to exist behind an action, fact, or material object. Development utilizes design and executes it, helping areas, cities, or places to advance. Sustainable development is that development which adheres to the values of sustainability and provide for the society without endangering the ecosystem and its services. \n\u201cWithout development, design is useless. Without design, development is unusable.\u201d \u2013 Florian Popescu, How to bridge the gap between design and development.\n"},
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_footprint", "title": "CarbonfootprintWikipedia", "body": "A  is historically defined as the total  (GHG) emissions caused by an individual, event, organization, or product, expressed as . Greenhouse gases, including the carbon-containing gases  and , can be emitted through the burning of , land clearance and the production and consumption of food, manufactured goods, materials, wood, roads, buildings, transportation and other services.\nIn most cases, the total carbon footprint cannot be calculated exactly because of inadequate knowledge of and data about the complex interactions between contributing processes, including the influence of natural processes that store or release carbon dioxide. For this reason, Wright, Kemp, and Williams proposed the following definition of a carbon footprint:\nA measure of the total amount of carbon dioxide (CO) and methane (CH) emissions of a defined population, system or activity, considering all relevant sources, sinks and storage within the spatial and temporal boundary of the population, system or activity of interest. Calculated as carbon dioxide equivalent using the relevant 100-year  (GWP100).The global average annual carbon footprint per person in the late 2010s was 0.7 tonnes  food, 1.1 tonnes from the home, 0.8 tonnes transport and 0.8 tonnes other.\nAn individual's, nation's, or organization's carbon footprint can be measured by undertaking a GHG emissions assessment, a , or other calculative activities denoted as . Once the size of a carbon footprint is known, a strategy can be devised to reduce it, for example, by technological developments,  improvements, better process and product management, changed , , consumption strategies,  and others.\nFor calculating personal carbon footprints, several free online carbon footprint calculators exist including a few supported by publicly available peer-reviewed data and calculations including the University of California, Berkeley's CoolClimate Network research consortium and CarbonStory. These websites ask you to answer more or less detailed questions about your diet, transportation choices, home size, shopping and recreational activities, usage of electricity, heating, and heavy appliances such as dryers and refrigerators, and so on. The website then estimates your carbon footprint based on your answers to these questions. A systematic literature review was conducted to objectively determine the best way to calculate individual/household carbon footprints. This review identified 13 calculation principles and subsequently used the same principles to evaluate the 15 most popular online carbon footprint calculators. A recent study's results by Carnegie Mellon's Christopher Weber found that the calculation of carbon footprints for products is often filled with large uncertainties. The variables of owning electronic goods such as the production, shipment, and previous technology used to make that product, can make it difficult to create an accurate carbon footprint. It is important to question, and address the accuracy of Carbon Footprint techniques, especially due to its overwhelming popularity.\nCalculating the carbon footprint of industry, product, or service is a complex task. One tool industry uses , where carbon footprint may be one of many factors taken into consideration when assessing a product or service. The  has a standard called ISO 14040:2006 that has the framework for conducting an LCA study. ISO 14060 family of standards provides further sophisticated tools for quantifying, monitoring, reporting and validating or verifying of GHG emissions and removals. Another method is through the , a set of standards for tracking GHG emissions.\nPredicting the carbon footprint of a process is also possible through estimations using the above standards. By using  and the estimated annual use of fuel, chemical, or other inputs, the carbon footprint can be determined while a process is being planned/designed.\nThe concept and name of the carbon footprint derive from the  concept, which was developed by  and  in the 1990s. While carbon footprints are usually reported in tons of emissions (CO-equivalent) per year, ecological footprints are usually reported in comparison to what the planet can renew. This assesses the number of \"earths\" that would be required if everyone on the planet consumed resources at the same level as the person calculating their ecological footprint. The carbon footprint is one part of the ecological footprint. The carbon part was popularized by a large campaign of  in 2005. Carbon footprints are more focused than ecological footprints since they measure merely emissions of gases that cause climate change into the atmosphere.\nCarbon footprint is one of a family of footprint indicators, which also include  and .\nDirect carbon emissions come from sources that are directly from the site that is producing a product. These emissions can also be referred to as scope 1 and scope 2 emissions.\nScope 1 emissions are emissions that are directly emitted from the site of the process or service. An example for industry would be the emissions related to burning a fuel on site. On the individual level, emissions from personal vehicles or gas burning stoves would fall under scope 1.\nScope 2 emissions are the other emissions related to purchased electricity, heat, and/or steam used on site. In the US, the EPA has broken down electricity emission factors by state.\nIn the UK, defra provides emission factors going back to 2002 covering scope 1, 2 and 3.\nDefra no longer provide international emission factors and refer visitors to the IEA who provide free highlights and paid for details covering Scope 1 and 2.\nIndirect carbon emissions are emissions from sources upstream or downstream from the process being studied, also known as scope 3 emissions.\nExamples of upstream, indirect carbon emissions may include:\nExamples of downstream, indirect carbon emissions may include:\nA July 2017 study published in  found that the most significant way individuals could mitigate their own carbon footprint is to have one less child (\"an average for developed countries of 58.6\u2009tonnes CO-equivalent (tCOe) emission reductions per year\"), followed by living car-free (2.4 tonnes CO-equivalent per year), forgoing air travel (1.6 tonnes CO-equivalent per trans-Atlantic trip) and adopting a plant-based diet (0.8 tonnes CO-equivalent per year). The study also found that most government resources on climate change focus on actions that have a relatively modest effect on greenhouse gas emissions, and concludes that \"a US family who chooses to have one fewer child would provide the same level of emissions reductions as 684 teenagers who choose to adopt comprehensive recycling for the rest of their lives\".\nAnother option is to drive less. Walking, biking, ,  and combining trips result in burning less fuel and releasing fewer emissions into the atmosphere.\nThe choice of diet is a major influence on a person's carbon footprint. Animal sources of protein (especially red meat), rice (typically produced in high methane-emitting paddies), foods transported long-distance or via fuel-inefficient transport (e.g., highly perishable produce flown long-distance) and heavily processed and packaged foods are among the major contributors to a high carbon diet. Scientists at the University of Chicago have estimated \"that the average American diet \u2013 which derives 28% of its calories from animal foods \u2013 is responsible for approximately one and a half more tonnes of greenhouse gasses \u2013 as  equivalents \u2013 per person, per year than a fully plant-based, or vegan, diet.\" Their calculations suggest that even replacing one third of the animal protein in the average American's diet with plant protein (e.g., beans, grains) can reduce the diet's carbon footprint by half a tonne. Exchanging two-thirds of the animal protein with plant protein is roughly equivalent to switching from a Toyota Camry to a Prius. Finally, throwing food out not only adds its associated carbon emissions to a person or household's footprint, but it also adds the emissions of transporting the wasted food to the garbage dump and the emissions of food decomposition, mostly in the form of the highly potent greenhouse gas, methane.\nOptions to reduce the carbon footprint of humans include . This can be done by using reusable items such as thermoses for daily coffee or plastic containers for water and other cold beverages rather than disposable ones. If that option isn't available, it is best to properly recycle the disposable items after use. When one household recycles at least half of their household waste, they can save 1.2 tons of carbon dioxide annually.\nAnother option for reducing the  footprint of humans is to use less air conditioning and heating in the home. By adding insulation to the walls and attic of one's home, and installing , or  around doors and windows one can lower their heating costs more than 25 percent. Similarly, one can very inexpensively upgrade the \"insulation\" (clothing) worn by residents of the home. For example, it's estimated that wearing a base layer of long underwear with top and bottom, made from a lightweight, super-insulating fabric like microfleece, can conserve as much body heat as a full set of clothing, allowing a person to remain warm with the thermostat lowered by over 5\u00a0\u00b0C. These measures all help because they reduce the amount of energy needed to heat and cool the house. One can also turn down the heat while sleeping at night or away during the day, and keep temperatures moderate at all times. Setting the thermostat just 2 degrees lower in winter and higher in summer could save about 1 ton of  each year.\nThe carbon handprint movement emphasizes individual forms of carbon offsetting, like using more public transportation or planting trees in deforested regions, to reduce one's carbon footprint and increase their \"handprint.\" The Handprint is being used around the world to strengthen action towards the fulfillment of the UN Sustainable Development Goals.\nThe most powerful industrial climate actions are:\nrefrigerant management (90 billion tonnes of COe 2017\u20132050, since refrigerants have thousands of times the warming potential of CO); land-based wind turbines for electricity (85 billion); reduced food waste (71 billion); and restoring tropical forests by ending use of the land for other purposes (61 billion). They calculate benefits cumulatively to 2050, rather than annually, because industrial actions have long lead times.\nA product, service, or company's carbon footprint can be affected by several factors including, but not limited to:\nThese factors can also change with location or industry. However, there are some general steps that can be taken to reduce carbon footprint on a larger scale.\nIn 2016, the EIA reported that in the US electricity is responsible for roughly 37% of Carbon Dioxide emissions, making it a potential target for reductions. Possibly the cheapest way to do this is through energy efficiency improvements. The ACEEE reported that energy efficiency has the potential to save the US over 800 billion kWh per year, based on 2015 data. Some potential options to increase energy efficiency include, but are not limited to:\nCarbon Footprints from energy consumption can be reduced through the development of  projects, such as solar and wind energy, which are renewable resources.\n, the restocking of existing forests or woodlands that have previously been depleted, is an example of , the counteracting of carbon dioxide emissions with an equivalent reduction of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Carbon offsetting can reduce a companies overall carbon footprint by offering a .\nA  or supply chain carbon footprint study can provide useful data which will help the business to identify specific and critical areas for improvement. By calculating or predicting a process\u2019 carbon footprint high emissions areas can be identified and steps can be taken to reduce in those areas.\nCarbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere, and the emissions of other GHGs, are often associated with the burning of fossil fuels, like natural gas, crude oil and coal. While this is harmful to the environment,  can be purchased in an attempt to make up for these harmful effects.\nThe  defines legally binding targets and timetables for cutting the GHG emissions of industrialized countries that ratified the Kyoto Protocol. Accordingly, from an economic or market perspective, one has to distinguish between a  and a . Typical for both markets is the trade with emission certificates:\nTo reach the goals defined in the Kyoto Protocol, with the least economical costs, the following  were introduced for the mandatory market:\nThe CDM and JI mechanisms requirements for projects which create a supply of emission reduction instruments, while  allows those instruments to be sold on international markets.\nThe CERs and ERUs can then be sold through . The demand for the CERs and ERUs being traded is driven by:\nNations which have failed to deliver their Kyoto emissions reductions obligations can enter  to purchase CERs and ERUs to cover their treaty shortfalls.  Nations and groups of nations can also create local emission reduction schemes which place mandatory carbon dioxide emission targets on entities within their national boundaries.  If the rules of a scheme allow, the obligated entities may be able to cover all or some of any reduction shortfalls by purchasing CERs and ERUs through .  While local emissions reduction schemes have no status under the  itself, they play a prominent role in creating the demand for CERs and ERUs, stimulating  and setting a  for emissions.\nA well-known mandatory local emissions trading scheme is the  (EU ETS).\nNew changes are being made to the trading schemes. The  is set to make some new changes within the next year. The new changes will target the emissions produced by flight travel in and out of the European Union.\nOther nations are scheduled to start participating in Emissions Trading Schemes within the next few years. These nations include China, India and the United States.\nIn contrast to the strict rules set out for the mandatory market, the voluntary market provides companies with different options to acquire emissions reductions. A solution, comparable with those developed for the mandatory market, has been developed for the voluntary market, the Verified Emission Reductions (VER). This measure has the great advantage that the projects/activities are managed according to the quality standards set out for CDM/JI projects but the certificates provided are not registered by the governments of the host countries or the Executive Board of the UNO. As such, high quality VERs can be acquired at lower costs for the same project quality. However, at present VERs can not be used in mandatory market.\nThe voluntary market in North America is divided between members of the Chicago Climate Exchange and the Over The Counter (OTC) market. The  is a voluntary yet legally binding  whereby members commit to the capped emission reductions and must purchase allowances from other members or offset excess emissions. The OTC market does not involve a legally binding scheme and a wide array of buyers from the public and private spheres, as well as special events that want to go . Being carbon neutral refers to achieving net zero carbon emissions by balancing a measured amount of carbon released with an equivalent amount sequestered or offset, or buying enough carbon credits to make up the difference.\nThere are project developers, wholesalers, brokers, and retailers, as well as carbon funds, in the voluntary market. Some businesses and nonprofits in the voluntary market encompass more than just one of the activities listed above. A report by Ecosystem Marketplace shows that carbon offset prices increase as it moves along the supply chain\u2014from project developer to retailer.\nWhile some mandatory emission reduction schemes exclude forest projects, these projects flourish in the voluntary markets. A major criticism concerns the imprecise nature of GHG sequestration quantification methodologies for forestry projects. However, others note the community co-benefits that  projects foster.\nProject types in the voluntary market range from avoided , afforestation/reforestation, industrial gas , increased , fuel switching,  from coal plants and , and even . Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) sold on the voluntary market are quite controversial due to  concerns. Industrial Gas projects receive criticism because such projects only apply to large industrial plants that already have high fixed costs. Siphoning off industrial gas for sequestration is considered picking the low hanging fruit; which is why credits generated from industrial gas projects are the cheapest in the voluntary market.\nThe size and activity of the voluntary carbon market are difficult to measure. The most comprehensive report on the voluntary carbon markets to date was released by Ecosystem Marketplace and New Carbon Finance in July 2007.\n of Japan is firstly approved by the Japanese authority to indicate a carbon footprint on three  goods in October 2009.\nAccording to The World Bank, the global average carbon footprint in 2014 was 4.97 metric tons CO/cap. The  average for 2007 was about 13.8 tons COe/cap, whereas for the ,  and  it was over 25 tons COe/cap. In 2017, the average for the USA was about 20 metric tons COe.\nMobility (driving, flying & small amount from public transit), shelter (electricity, heating, construction) and food are the most important consumption categories determining the carbon footprint of a person. In the , the carbon footprint of mobility is evenly split between direct emissions (e.g. from driving private cars) and emissions embodied in purchased products related to mobility (air transport service, emissions occurring during the production of cars and during the extraction of fuel).\nThe carbon footprint of U.S. households is about 5 times greater than the global average. For most U.S. households the single most important action to reduce their carbon footprint is driving less or switching to a more efficient vehicle.\nThe following table compares, from peer-reviewed studies of full life cycle emissions and from various other studies, the carbon footprint of various forms of energy generation: nuclear, hydro, coal, gas, solar cell, peat and wind generation technology.  (Studies dated 2006 and 2008)\nNote: 3.6 megajoules (MJ) = 1 kilowatt-hour (kW\u00b7h), thus 1g/MJ = 3.6g/kW\u00b7h.\nLegend\nThese three studies thus concluded that hydroelectric, wind, and nuclear power produced the least CO per kilowatt-hour of any other electricity sources.\nThese figures do not allow for emissions due to accidents or terrorism.  and , emit no carbon from the operation, but do leave a footprint during construction phase and maintenance during operation.  from reservoirs also has large footprints from initial removal of vegetation and ongoing methane (stream detritus decays anaerobically to methane in bottom of reservoir, rather than aerobically to CO if it had stayed in an unrestricted stream).\nThe table above gives the carbon footprint per kilowatt-hour of electricity generated, which is about half the world's man-made CO output. The CO footprint for heat is equally significant and research shows that using waste heat from power generation in combined heat and power district heating, chp/dh has the lowest carbon footprint, much lower than micro-power or heat pumps.\nCoal production has been refined to greatly reduce carbon emissions; since the 1980s, the amount of energy used to produce a ton of steel has decreased by 50%.\nThis section gives representative figures for the carbon footprint of the fuel burned by different transport types (not including the carbon footprints of the vehicles or related infrastructure themselves). The precise figures vary according to a wide range of factors.\nSome representative figures for CO emissions are provided by LIPASTO's survey of average direct emissions (not accounting for high-altitude radiative effects) of airliners expressed as CO and CO equivalent per passenger kilometre:\nHowever, emissions per unit distance travelled is not necessarily the best indicator for the carbon footprint of air travel, because the distances covered are commonly longer than by other modes of travel. It is the total emissions for a trip that matters for a carbon footprint, not merely the rate of emissions. For example, because air travel makes rapid long-distance travel feasible, a holiday destination may be chosen that is much more distant than if another mode of travel were used.\nCO emissions per passenger-kilometre (pkm) for all road travel for 2011 in Europe as provided by the European Environment Agency:\nFor vehicles, average figures for CO emissions per kilometer for road travel for 2013 in Europe, normalized to the , are provided by the International Council on Clean Transportation:\nAverage figures for the  are provided by the , based on the , for the following categories:\nIn 2005, the US company Amtrak's carbon dioxide equivalent emissions per passenger kilometre were 116\u00a0g, about twice as high as the UK rail average (where much more of the system is electrified), and about eight times a Finnish electric intercity train.\nAverage carbon dioxide emissions by ferries per passenger-kilometre seem to be 0.12\u00a0kg (4.2\u00a0oz). However, 18- ferries between Finland and Sweden produce 0.221\u00a0kg (7.8\u00a0oz) of CO, with total emissions equalling a CO equivalent of 0.223\u00a0kg (7.9\u00a0oz), while 24\u201327-knot ferries between Finland and Estonia produce 0.396\u00a0kg (14.0\u00a0oz) of CO with total emissions equalling a CO equivalent of 0.4\u00a0kg (14\u00a0oz).\nSeveral organizations offer footprint calculators for public and corporate use, and several organizations have calculated carbon footprints of products. The US Environmental Protection Agency has addressed paper, plastic (candy wrappers), glass, cans, computers, carpet and tires. Australia has addressed lumber and other building materials. Academics in Australia, Korea and the US have addressed paved roads. Companies, nonprofits and academics have addressed mailing letters and packages. Carnegie Mellon University has estimated the CO footprints of 46 large sectors of the economy in each of eight countries. Carnegie Mellon, Sweden and the Carbon Trust have addressed foods at home and in restaurants.\nThe Carbon Trust has worked with UK manufacturers on foods, shirts and detergents, introducing a  in March 2007. The label is intended to comply with a new British  (i.e. not a standard), PAS 2050, and is being actively piloted by The Carbon Trust and various industrial partners. As of August 2012 The Carbon Trust state they have measured 27,000 certifiable product carbon footprints.\nEvaluating the package of some products is key to figuring out the carbon footprint. The key way to determine a carbon footprint is to look at the materials used to make the item. For example, a juice carton is made of an aseptic carton, a beer can is made of aluminum, and some water bottles either made of glass or plastic. The larger the size, the larger the footprint will be.\nIn a 2014 study by Scarborough et al., the real-life diets of British people were surveyed and their dietary  estimated. Average dietary greenhouse-gas emissions per day (in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent) were:\nThe precise carbon footprint of different textiles varies considerably according to a wide range of factors. However, studies of textile production in Europe suggest the following carbon dioxide equivalent emissions footprints per kilo of textile at the point of purchase by a consumer:\nAccounting for durability and energy required to wash and dry textile products, synthetic fabrics generally have a substantially lower carbon footprint than natural ones.\nThe carbon footprint of materials (also known as embodied carbon) varies widely. The carbon footprint of many common materials can be found in the Inventory of Carbon & Energy database, the GREET databases and models, and LCA databases via openLCA Nexus. The carbon footprint of any manufactured product should be verified by a third-party.\n production gives a major contribution to CO emissions. Cement production and carbon footprint resulting from  in Italy as of 2003 was 8.0  per person CO emissions. The balance between carbon loss due to soil sealing and carbon stocked in man-made infrastructures resulted in a net loss to the atmosphere, minus 0.6 tonne CO per  and year.\n at \n\n"},
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability_brand", "title": "SustainabilitybrandWikipedia", "body": " are products and services that are  to signify a special added value in terms of environmental and social benefits to the customer and thus enable the differentiation from competitors.\nSustainability branding is the process of creating and maintaining an identity of a specific product, service, or business that reflects special added value in terms of environmental and social benefits. A brand is only perceived as being sustainable if it can credibly convey sustainability benefits which are noticeable by and relevant to the consumer. A sustainability brand must have an integrated culture for success. The key to a sustainable brand is trust between the consumer and the brand, only when this is achieved can a sustainable brand truly generate a USP and reap the benefits of it.\nOpposed to the term green brands which mainly focuses on environmentally sound business practices, sustainability brands additionally acknowledge the social dimension of  providing products and services. This entails, among others, health and safety issues resulting from direct or indirect product use (consumption level) as well as the conditions under which a particular product is produced (production level). The  of people at work (i.e. employees as well as workers within the supply chains) are important indicators of sustainability brands and sustainability marketing in general which adheres to the triple bottom line of ecological (environmental), social (equity), and financial (economic) sustainability.\nA brand is able to evoke positive or negative feelings, especially in the context of sensitive social and ecological issues. The more positive the perceptions and feelings are towards a brand, the higher will be the likelihood of identification and . It is therefore crucial in sustainability marketing to build up strong brands. In doing so, companies face far-reaching decisions in the areas of brand positioning (1), sustainability brand name selection (2), and sustainability brand development (3), in order to create and build sustainability brands that consumers associate with social and environmental added value.\n claims on products and packages need to be made (and read) with caution. Ambiguous  titles such as ,  and   can be confusing without specific definition. Some regulators, such as the US Federal Trade Commission, are providing guidance\nSince the adjective \u201csustainable\u201d might convey the notion of brands that have long-lasting success, implicating durable competitive advantage without any particular reference to a sustainability agenda, the term \u201csustainability brand\u201d should be used to prevent ambiguity. Albeit subtle difference, the latter explicitly emphasizes the notion of brands which have built their brand image upon sustainable business practices that consumers value. Sustainability brands are commonly referred to in the field of sustainability marketing.\nSustainability Brand Positioning and positioning in general is part of the brand identity and  that is to be actively communicated to the target audience and can be described as an iterative process, consisting of deliberate and proactive actions aimed at the definition of distinct consumer perceptions. Sustainable brand positioning is the brand positioning of Sustainable products and services. Sustainable products and services should offer an improved social and ecological performance during the whole product lifecycle and at the same time they have to satisfy consumer needs and wants. Many of the first generation sustainability brands failed in the market because companies overemphasized the positive socio-ecological product attributes, while they neglected to focus on other product attributes such as performance, functionality or design, too. As a result, many products could not compete against conventional products.\nTo build up and position strong sustainability brands, there are some guidelines to follow. Marc Stoiber  summed them up in :  Consumer Facing, Competitive, Core, Conversational and credible. Perrine Bouhana added to that concept \u201ca sixth C\u201d: Consistency. Martin Belz complemented and revised this concept to \u201c8 C\u2019s\u201d of sustainability branding and describes them as followed:\nIn the course of choosing the right name, Sustainability brands must first \u2013just like brand names in the conventional sense- follow well-established rules. In general, a good brand name should consider three areas: memorability (distinctive short name, evoking emotions\u2026), strategic fit (they should relate to the actual product; ability to expand to other brands) and legal (legal protection under trade mark law etc.) \nSustainability Brands, however, go one step further and incorporate something that conveys the notion of social and/or ecological awareness.\nA popular example is \u201cBetter Place\u201d, a global provider of electric vehicle networks and services that works in a joint venture with Renault Nissan Alliance Motor Company to promote the use of electric cars. The founder, Shai Agassi, was intrigued by a question posed at the World Economic Forum in 2005 \"How do you make the world a better place by 2020?\".\nThus the name Better Place. It is not related to the product (electric vehicle) but to much wider social and ecological issues (depletion of natural resources, CO2 emissions\u2026), which the company addresses or rather offers the solution for.\nSustainability brand names can be part of a new product launch, an extension to an existing (conventional) brand or be so new to the market that they create a product category themselves. Each of these approaches has specific strategic implications.\nEntering a saturated market such as the one for conventional household detergents with a sustainability brand might prove extremely difficult. However, there are companies that have successfully entered the market and positioned their brand as sustainability leaders. Seventh Generation, for instance, is the US market leader in four product categories (Household, Laundry, Personal and Baby Care) with products that \u2013in the words of the company- \u201cprotect human health and the environment.\u201d \nEstablished brands can leverage their existing brand recognition to extend their name to new products, which are then marketed as socially and ecologically friendly. Tide, a popular detergent brand in the US, expanded its brand to meet the demands of the ecological conscious consumer by launching Tide Cold Water Detergent in 2005. The product requires only cold water and thus saves energy. In 2010, it was given the Green GH seal, which is only awarded after a \u201ccradle to grave\u201d examination of the product.\nSustainability brand names can also succeed if they achieve to create a product category for themselves where there is virtually no competition yet. When the car-sharing concept was fairly new, companies such as Mobility CarSharing in Switzerland did neither compete with car companies nor public transportation providers.\nSustainability brands are subject to constant change. A sustainability brand that is well established on the market, can be further developed into different directions. According to Belz and Peattie  four main options for development are possible:\nTo create a sustainability brand it is furthermore important to adopt the right channels for marketing according to Lauterborns five Cs. Advertising in this case can help to create awareness of the brand and thus form the new brand experience.\nFurthermore, it is obligatory for Sustainability brands to obtain one ore more , leading to a higher influence on consumer behaviour and the perception of the brand.\n"},

What it means by \u2018the number of people neither grows nor declines\u2019 is that births plus in-migrants equal deaths plus out-migrants.\nA loosely defined goal of ZPG is to match the , which is the average number of children per woman which would hold the population constant. This replacement fertility will depend on  and the sex ratio at birth, and varies from around 2.1 in developed countries to over 3.0 in some developing countries.\nThe American  and   is credited with coining the term  but it was used earlier by George Stolnitz, who stated that the concept of a  dated back to 1693.  A mathematical description was given by .\nIn the late 1960s ZPG became a prominent political movement in the U.S. and parts of Europe, with strong links to  and .  was a stronghold of the ZPG activists who believed \u201cthat a constantly increasing population is responsible for many of our problems: pollution, violence, loss of values and of individual privacy.\u201d Founding fathers of the movement were , author of , Richard Bowers, a Connecticut lawyer, and Professor . Ehrlich stated: \u201cThe mother of the year should be a sterilized woman with two adopted children.\u201d\nIn the long term, zero population growth can be achieved when the  of a population equals the , i.e. fertility is at replacement level and birth and death rates are stable, a condition also called demographic equilibrium. Unstable rates can lead to drastic changes in population levels. This analysis is valid for the planet as a whole (assuming that  remains at zero or negligible levels), but not necessarily for a region or country as it ignores . A population that has been growing in the past will have a higher proportion of young people.  As it is younger people who have children, there is large time lag between the point at which the fertility rate (mean total number of children each woman has during her childbearing years) falls to the replacement level (the fertility rate which would result in equal birth and death rates for a population at equilibrium) and the point at which the population stops rising. The reason for this is that even though the fertility rate has dropped to replacement level, people already continue to live for some time within a population. Therefore, equilibrium, with a static population, will not be reached until the first \"replacement level\" birth cohorts reach old age and die. The related calculations are complex because the population's overall death rate can vary over time, and mortality also varies with age (being highest among the old).\nConversely, with fertility below replacement, a large elderly generation eventually results (as in an aging \u201c\u201d); but since that generation failed to replace itself during its  years, a subsequent \u201cpopulation bust\u201d, or decrease in population, will occur when the older generation dies off. This effect has been termed . In addition, if a country's fertility is at replacement level, and has been that way for at least several decades (to stabilize its age distribution), then that country's population could still experience coincident growth due to continuously increasing , even though the population growth is likely to be smaller than it would be from natural population increase.\nZero population growth is often a goal of demographic planners and  who believe that reducing population growth is essential for the health of the . Preserving cultural traditions and  is a factor for not allowing human populations levels or rates to fall too low. Achieving ZPG is difficult because a country's population growth is often determined by economic factors, incidence of poverty, natural disasters, disease, etc.\nHowever, even if there is zero population growth, there may be changes in demographics of great , such as changes in .\nNumber of demographic experts have suggested a few ways to reach zero population growth.\nBiologist Alan D. Thornhill and Author  argue that human population growth is a function of the human food supply and that human population growth can only be achieved by an expanded food supply to support the growing population. In 1998, they produced a video entitled \"\" where they explain the theory and answer audience questions.\n, an emeritus professor of physics at University of Colorado at Boulder in his lifetime, suggested that a population has the following choices to achieve ZPG:\nSimilarly, Jason Brent, another demographic expert, argues that there are three ways to achieve zero population growth. His argument is as follows:\n is the largest country by population in the world, having some 1.4 billion people. China is expected to have a zero population growth rate by 2030. China's population growth has slowed since the beginning of this century. This was mostly the result of China's economic growth and increasing living standards which led to the decline. However, many demographers also credit China's , which was formulated in the early 1970s, encourages late marriages, late childbearing, and the use of contraceptives, and since 1980 has limited most urban couples to one child and most rural couples to two children. According to government projections, the work-age population will then drop to 870 million.  It was said, in 2009, that the Chinese government was hoping to see zero population growth in the future but, in November 2013, a relaxation of the one-child policy was announced amid unpopularity, reduced labour pool and support for an ageing population.\n\n"},

The sustainability marketing mix includes the 4C's (Customer solution, Communication, Customer cost, ) and makes sustainability advertising a part of the sustainability communication concept.\nSustainability advertising is used to advert customers to , services and actions.

Sustainability advertising contributes to all three pillars of : ,  and .\nWhenever an advertisement campaign is developed and launched as a marketing strategy for a sustainable product or service, it must be aligned to the objectives defined by the company in the context of sustainability. Some of the common objectives of marketing communications are: generation of awareness, informing consumers, reminding consumers, persuading consumers, reassuring consumers, motivating and rewarding consumers and connecting with them. These are the basis for more specific objectives of sustainability advertising with the emphasis on environmental and social aspects.\nThe  () has developed documents that give insights about the objectives of the sustainability advertising. They include:\nThe conventional marketing mix concept was gradually developed during the economic miracle right after World War II and included the 4P\u2019s model, introduced around 1960. This model, in which the promotion of products with advertising as one of its main tools plays an important role, was helpful for many industries in many markets.\u201d  However, the market situation changed: con-sumers became more aware of the social and ecological implications of their purchases and at the same time inherent attributes like efficiency and cost effectiveness, health and safety, symbolism and status needed to be highlighted by companies in order to remain competitive in the market. The companies have been adapting to the changes and now move towards \u201crelationship marketing focused more on communicating with the consumer\u201d rather than just promoting the product. They use advertising, along with other activities and resources, as a tool to inform the consumers and stakeholders about the sustainability solutions the company provides and about the company as a whole.\n\u201cThe relationship between marketing and the environment has been examined since the early 1970s\u201d. First, the idea of ecological marketing was developed and mainly centered in the \u201cdepletion of energy and non-energy natural resources and the pollution created as by-product of production and consumption.\u201d \u201cThe first tentative steps of non-polluting industry and first uses of nature in advertising arose\u201d and were later accompanied by an intensive mediatization of environmental issues in the 1980s. For example: the discovery of the \u00b4hole in the ozone layer` in 1985 and Chernobyl in 1986. By this time,   and  concepts were built up and elements from the product  (associated with environmental marketing) as well as destruction of ecosystems and poverty in developing countries (associated with green marketing) were considered in the advertising campaigns.\nLately, the concept of sustainability advertising has evolved as it is defined in the first part of this article. It has encountered critics, and limitations, but also challenges that are guiding the companies, governments and organizations to the implementation of more holistic and sustainable practices in the process of providing products and services worldwide.\nInformation carriers of marketing messages are mainly mainstream media like national television, national radio and print. Those media are also engaged in sustainability promotion, because they are central players in building consumers culture. Within radio, print or television campaigns sustainability advertisements are pointing out the social, environmental and economical benefits of sustainable products and services. Strategic advertising messages are then connected with corporate communication leading towards the development of a responsible and civic image of the company. However, mainstream media have constrains in promoting sustainability issues due to limitations to the application of persuasive, motivational or educative communication. Most sustainability advertising campaigns therefore combine different types of mainstream media to approach the consumer on different levels of information reception.\nSustainability advertising on the Radio refers only to audio. High imagery ads that elicit visual images in the minds of listeners show positive effects on attitude toward the brand and purchase intention. \nThe right choice of words for the campaign and the possibility to activate imagination of the consumer and raise the desire for the product or service is the challenge for radio advertising.\n are paper based media methods like magazines, newspaper, books, flyers or posters. Therefore, print advertising generally includes a higher resource use in terms of paper, compared to digital radio and television campaigns.\nThe choice of the right print media is important to inform the defined target group about the sustainable products and services. Advertisements in daily newspapers whose readers are ed-ucated and interested in sustainability issues, as well as in magazines promoting a sustainable lifestyle contribute to raise consumers\u2019 interest in sustainable products and services. Posters on the other hand are often used for social marketing campaigns.\nTelevision is the dominant type of media in the developed countries and combines audio and visual possibilities of sustainability advertising. Its effectiveness results from \u2018learning without involvement\u2019 which means that the consumer takes up the information even without being interested at first. Consequentially, television is an essential media for sustainability advertising.\nThe target group for sustainability advertising is . They are aware of sustainable development issues or in the niche of activists and follow sustainability principles. These consumers have a continuously developing commitment towards a more responsible lifestyle and are serious in their sustainable intentions and behavior. They are interested in information about products or services, real product labeling and have an independent attitude towards mass media and advertising. Responsible consumers can be seen as 'optimistic realists' encouraging society to continue development in a sustainable way.  They are critical towards their own behavior concerning environmental impact of the products or services they consume. Responsible consumers are sensitive for corporate behavior and are careful in trusting companies which laud their social or environmental commitment even if it is independently monitored. They consume efficiently, see economic growth decoupled from environmental degradation and focus on \u2018common but differentiated responsibility\u2019 to improve the quality of life. Responsible consumers demand a higher value from their purchases in terms of social responsibility, environmental impacderations. They show an increasing awareness on social and environmental issues and offers in domestic and export markets. Focusing on the responsible consumer as an overall target group, further division into the following target subgroups can be made:\n. Speed and scale with which the message is spread refers to one of the most significant advantages of the sustainability advertising. Advertising is capable of reaching a large or dispersed market repeatedly with persuasive and informative messages and is considered to be one of the most powerful sources of symbolic meaning in modern society. Sustainability advertising campaigns \n. Being one of the tools of sustainability communication strategy, advertising campaigns focus on the intrinsic motivations of the consumers, their attitudes and beliefs as one of the determinants of the sustainability friendly consumption behavior.\nSustainability advertising represents the primary communication tool to which major part of con-sumer group is exposed on the market. It serves as a for the consumers, concerning the social and environmental status of product and company. On the basis of the primary impression the consumer than takes the decision whether the product and the company behind deserve further evaluation as a potential purchase choice. Therefore, sustainability advertising \u201chelps to inform consumers and facilitates consumer choice\u201d.\nAs marketing communication tool sustainability advertising can be used as an instrument to  .  There are three factors, which contribute to the total human impact: \nSustainability advertising addresses affluence by promoting reduction of the environmental and social footprint of the society on the planet. Originally advertising was one of the factors that created consumption culture, thus playing an important role in shaping consumer preferences and the social and environmental impact they produce. Sustainability advertising however, is responsible for the lifestyle changes in the society, from materialistic towards more sustainable.\nA variety of marketing communication tools offer producers a wide range of opportunities to build relationships with a consumer.  Due to the format restrictions sustainability advertising often is not able provide comprehensive information about the product. Nevertheless, it  (e.g. a company\u2019s web page) where consumer can find more data on environmental and social aspects of the product. This link enables further development of the communication process between the company and the consumer. So, under favorable conditions and linked to a competent communication strategy it can be transformed into long lasting mutually beneficial relationships between the two.\nPromoting sustainable solutions through Sustainability Advertising provides corporations with big  and allows them to educate and inform consumers as well as stimulate their emotions towards the product. Nevertheless, there are some limitations:\nGeneral advertising as well as Sustainability Advertising operate by sending out  to its entire audience at one. At the same time the ability to connect with the single consumers as well as the chances for them to respond are strongly limited. That means the creation of feedback-relationships between corporations and its customers through sustainable advertisement is limited too. To avoid the typical one-way communication and to provide consumers and corporations with the chance to give and receive feedback, advertising can be used in combination with other key media such as online communication or labeling. Interactive advertising then enables the company to build op strong customer-relationships despite the primer lack of personalized messages.\nA special challenge for Sustainability Advertising is the  that have to be communicated. To avoid what is called  \u00b4Sustainability Advertising Myopia` \u2013 an exclusive focus on the \u201cgreen\u201d aspects of the product \u2013 the advertising message should not only include the social and environmental attributes of a product, but also connect them to the inherent , as well as men-tion the main buying criteria influencing the consumers\u00b4 .  However, communicating meaningful about the complex interplay of social, environmental, economic, technical and consumer benefits of a product from a sustainability perspective using a 30-second radio or television slot or a single printed page can be a serious challenge. To make information uptake easier for consumers a selection of the core information and its transformation into simple advertising messages in combination with other key media, like annual environmental reports or links to web pages that provide more detailed information about the product, can be helpful.\nA challenge related to the complexity of messages is the . It results from the corporations\u2019 effort to gain more credibility and trust by providing search qualities in form of text and fact oriented advertising. However, facing the information overload of today\u2019s consumers mainly socio-ecologically conscious consumers perceive the fact focused advertising. Enhancing the emotional appeal of Sustainability Advertising can create emotional connections with a larger range of consumers and stimulate their involvement with the product. One of the most common approaches is the so-called: \"Ecotainment\" \u2013 the creation of consumer's involvement by including a celebrity into the advertisement.\nA strong threat to the credibility of Sustainability Advertising can be seen in corporate \u201c\u201d, a form of disinformation from organizations seeking to repair public reputations and further shape public images. It allows firms to manipulate an image of environmental, social, and cultural responsiveness by communicating false or misleading sustainability claims. This common practice damages the overall credibility of corporate sustainability claims and leads to mistrust of the consumers. This general inconsistency between a company\u2019s messages and it actions could finally explain the  between consumers strongly expressed concerns about socio-ecological issues and their nevertheless relatively low purchase of sustainable goods and services.\nTherefore, the most important future challenge concerning firms as well as advertising agencies is certainly a . Especially advertising agencies often lack the technical expertise to ensure that the communications of new sustainable messages are credible and fail to ensure that there is alignment between a client's corporate practices and external communications. This often leads to passed up marketing opportunities and hinders the creation of positive brand value. To overcome those barriers advertising agencies must gain expertise and experience in the fields of sustainable advertising, so the promotion of sustainability issues becomes part of a real corporate philosophy advertised through all communication channels.\n"},

The first, which posits a triad of environmental sustainability, , and social sustainability, is the most widely accepted as a model for addressing sustainability.  The concept of \"social sustainability\" in this approach encompasses such topics as: , , , , , , , , , , , , community resilience, and human adaptation.\nA second, more recent, approach suggests that all of the domains of sustainability are social: including ecological, economic, political and cultural sustainability. These domains of social sustainability are all dependent upon the relationship between the social and the natural, with the \"ecological domain\" defined as human embeddedness in the environment. In these terms, social sustainability encompasses all human activities. It is not just relevant to the focussed intersection of economics, the environment and the social. (See the Venn diagram and the  diagram).\nAccording to the Western Australia Council of Social Services (WACOSS): \nAnother definition has been developed by Social Life, a UK-based social enterprise specialising in place-based innovation. They define social sustainability as \".\"\nSocial Life have developed a framework for social sustainability  which has four dimensions: amenities and infrastructure, social and cultural life, voice and influence, and space to grow.\nNobel Laureate  gives the following dimensions for social sustainability:\nAlso we can speak of Sustainable Human Development that can be seen as development that promotes the capabilities of present people without compromising capabilities of future generations. In the human development paradigm, environment and natural resources should constitute a means of achieving better standards of living just as income represents a means of increasing social expenditure and, in the end, well-being.\nThe different aspects of social sustainability are often considered in  (SRI). Social sustainability criteria that are commonly used by SRI funds and indexes to rate publicly traded companies include: community, diversity, employee relations, human rights, product safety, reporting, and governance structure.\nRecently, design has been identified as a key strategic tool for achieving social sustainability. \nThe  state that countries have the obligation to \u201crespect, protect, and fulfill human rights and fundamental freedoms\u201d and that business enterprises are required to comply with all applicable laws and respect human rights.

In addition resources like Free2Work, the , and  all provide information on organizational disclosures and performance in social sustainability.

By 1000 BCE, civilizations were also established in India, China, Mexico, Peru and in parts of Europe. Sumer illustrates issues central to the sustainability of human civilization. Sumerian cities practised intensive, year-round  from \u00a0BCE. The surplus of storable food created by this economy allowed the population to settle in one place instead of migrating in search of wild foods and grazing land. It also allowed for a much greater population density. The development of agriculture in Mesopotamia required many labourers to build and maintain its  system. This, in turn, led to political , , and  sanction, along with standing  to protect the emergent civilization. Intensified agriculture allowed for population increase, but also led to  in upstream areas with resultant flooding and over-irrigation, which raised .  While there was a shift from the cultivation of  to the more salt-tolerant , yields still diminished. Eventually, decreasing agricultural production and other factors led to the decline of the civilization. From 2100 BC to 1700 BC, it is estimated that the population was reduced by nearly sixty percent. Civilizations similarly thought to have eventually fallen because of poor management of resources include the ,  and , among many others. In contrast, stable communities of  and  existed in  and , and large agrarian communities in ,  and elsewhere have farmed in the same localities for centuries. Some Polynesian cultures have maintained stable communities for between 1,000 and 3,000 years on small islands with minimal resources using  and  to control human pressure on the environment. In Sri Lanka  nature reserves  established during the reign of king  and dating back to 307 BC were devoted to sustainability and harmonious living with nature.\nTechnological advances over several millennia gave humans increasing control over the environment. But it was the Western  of the 18th to 19th centuries that tapped into the vast growth potential of the energy in .  was used to power ever more efficient engines and later to generate electricity. Modern sanitation systems and advances in medicine protected large populations from disease. Such conditions led to a human population explosion and unprecedented industrial, technological and scientific growth that has continued to this day, marking the commencement of a period of global human influence known as the . From 1650 to 1850 the global population doubled from around 500 million to 1 billion people.\nConcerns about the environmental and social impacts of industry were expressed by some  political economists and through the  of the 1800s.

In the late 19th century  was the first botanist to study physiological relations between plants and their environment, heralding the scientific discipline of .\nBy the 20th century, the industrial revolution had led to an exponential increase in the human consumption of resources. The increase in health, wealth and population was perceived as a simple path of progress.  However, in the 1930s economists began developing models of  management (see ) and the sustainability of welfare in an economy that uses non-renewable resources ().\n had now gained general acceptance as a scientific discipline, and many concepts vital to sustainability were being explored. These included: the interconnectedness of all living systems in a single living planetary system, the ; the importance of  (of water, nutrients and other chemicals, materials, waste); and the passage of energy through  of living systems.\nFollowing the deprivations of the great depression and World War II the  entered a new period of escalating growth, a post-1950s \"great acceleration ... a surge in the human enterprise that has emphatically stamped humanity as a global geophysical force.\"  A gathering  pointed out that there were environmental costs associated with the many material benefits that were now being enjoyed. Innovations in technology (including plastics, synthetic chemicals, nuclear energy) and the increasing use of fossil fuels, were transforming society. Modern industrial agriculture\u2014the \"\"\u2014was based on the development of synthetic fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides which had devastating consequences for rural wildlife, as documented by American marine biologist, naturalist and environmentalist   in  (1962).\nIn 1956, American geoscientist   theory predicted an inevitable peak of oil production, first in the United States (between 1965 and 1970), then in successive regions of the world\u2014with a global peak expected thereafter. In the 1970s environmentalism's concern with pollution, the population explosion, consumerism and the depletion of finite resources found expression in  by British economist   in 1973, and  published by the global think tank, the , in 1975.\nEnvironmental problems were now becoming global in scale. The 1973 and 1979 energy crises demonstrated the extent to which the global community had become dependent on a nonrenewable resource; President Carter in his State of the Union Address called on Americans to \"Conserve energy. Eliminate waste. Make 1980 indeed a year of energy conservation.\" While the developed world was considering the problems of unchecked development the developing countries, faced with continued poverty and deprivation, regarded development as essential  to raise the living standards of their peoples.  In 1980 the  had published its influential  followed in 1982 by its  which drew attention to the decline of the world's .\nIn 1987 the   (the Brundtland Commission), in its report  suggested that development was acceptable, but it must be  that would meet the needs of the poor while not increasing environmental problems. Humanity's demand on the planet has more than doubled over the past 45 years as a result of population growth and increasing individual consumption. In 1961 almost all countries in the world had more than enough capacity to meet their own demand; by 2005 the situation had changed radically with many countries able to meet their needs only by importing resources from other nations. A move toward  by increasing public awareness and adoption of , and  emerged. The development of renewable sources of energy in the 1970s and '80s, primarily in  and  and increased use of , presented some of the first sustainable alternatives to fossil fuel and  generation, the first large-scale solar and wind power plants appearing during the 1980s and '90s. Also at this time many local and state governments in developed countries began to implement small-scale sustainability policies.\nThrough the work of climate scientists in the   there is increasing global awareness of the threat posed by the human-induced enhanced greenhouse effect, produced largely by forest clearing and the burning of fossil fuels. In March 2009 the , an international team of leading climate scientists, issued a strongly worded statement:\n\"The climate system is already moving beyond the patterns of natural variability within which our society and economy have developed and thrived. These parameters include global mean surface temperature, sea-level rise, ocean and , , and extreme climatic events. There is a significant risk that many of the trends will accelerate, leading to an increasing risk of abrupt or irreversible climatic shifts.\"\n now seeks to bridge the gap between ecology and traditional : it provides an inclusive and ethical economic model for society. A plethora of new concepts to help implement and measure sustainability are becoming more widely accepted including the ,  (more sustainable urban environments),  (the  analysis of resource use and environmental impact over the life cycle of a product or process), , ,  (increased recycling of materials),  (removing dependence on fossil fuels) and much more.\nThe work of  and  amongst many others, has brought some of the cultural wisdom of traditional, sustainable agrarian societies into the academic discourse on sustainability, and also blended that with modern scientific principles.

In the , it refers generally to the capacity for the  and human  to coexist. It is also defined as the process of people maintaining change in a  balanced , in which the exploitation of resources, the direction of investments, the orientation of technological development and institutional change are all in harmony and enhance both current and future potential to meet human needs and aspirations. For many in the field, sustainability is defined through the following interconnected domains or pillars: environment, economic and social, which according to  is based on the principles of Systems Thinking. Sub-domains of sustainable development have been considered also: cultural, technological and political. According to ,  is defined as development that \"meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\" Sustainable development may be the  of sustainability, yet others may view the two terms as paradoxical (i.e., development is inherently unsustainable).\nSustainability can also be defined as a  process characterized by the pursuit of a common ideal. \nAn ideal is by definition unattainable in a given time and space. However, by persistently and dynamically approaching it, the process results in a sustainable system. Many environmentalists and ecologists argue that sustainability is achieved through the balance of species and the resources within their environment. As is typically practiced in , the goal is to maintain this equilibrium, available resources must not be depleted faster than resources are naturally generated.\nModern use of the term sustainability is broad and difficult to define precisely. Originally, sustainability meant making only such use of natural, renewable resources that people can continue to rely on their yields in the long term. The concept of sustainability, or Nachhaltigkeit in German, can be traced back to  (1645\u20131714), and was applied to forestry.\nHealthy ecosystems and  are necessary to the survival of humans and other . Ways of reducing negative human impact are  ,  and . Information is gained from , , ,  and .  studies the fields of academic research that aim to address human economies and natural ecosystems.\nMoving towards sustainability is also a social challenge that entails  and national ,  and , supply chain management, local and individual  and . Ways of living more sustainably can take many forms from reorganizing living conditions (e.g., ,  and ), reappraising economic sectors (, , ), or work practices (), using science to develop new technologies (,  and sustainable  and ), or designing systems in a flexible and reversible manner, and adjusting individual  that conserve natural resources.\nIn sum, \"the term 'sustainability' should be viewed as humanity's target goal of human-ecosystem equilibrium (homeostasis), while 'sustainable development' refers to the holistic approach and temporal processes that lead us to the end point of sustainability.\" Despite the increased popularity of the use of the term \"sustainability\", the possibility that human societies will achieve environmental sustainability has been, and continues to be, questioned\u2014in light of , , , population growth and societies' pursuit of unlimited  in a .\nThe name sustainability is derived from the   (, to hold; , under).  can mean \"maintain\", \"support\", \"uphold\" or \"endure\".\nThe  identified sustainable development goals, such as economic development, social development, and environmental protection. This view has been expressed as an illustration using three overlapping ellipses indicating that the three pillars of sustainability are not mutually exclusive and can be mutually reinforcing. In fact, the three pillars are interdependent, and in the long run, none can exist without the others. The three pillars have served as a common ground for numerous  systems in recent years, in particular in the food industry. Standards which today explicitly refer to the triple bottom line include ,  and . Some sustainability experts and practitioners have illustrated four pillars of sustainability or a quadruple bottom line. One such pillar is future generations, which emphasizes the long-term thinking associated with sustainability.  There is also an opinion that considers resource use and financial sustainability as two additional pillars of sustainability.\nSustainable development consists of balancing local and global efforts to meet basic human needs without destroying or degrading the natural environment. The question then becomes how to represent the relationship between those needs and the environment.\nA study from 2005 pointed out that  is as important as  sustainable development. Ecological economist  asked, \"what use is a sawmill without a forest?\" From this perspective, the economy is a subsystem of human society, which is itself a subsystem of the biosphere, and a gain in one sector is a loss from another. This perspective led to the nested circles figure of 'economics' inside 'society' inside the 'environment'.\nThe simple definition that sustainability is something that improves \"the  while living within the carrying capacity of supporting eco-systems\", though vague, conveys the idea of sustainability having quantifiable limits. But sustainability is also a call to action, a task in progress or \"journey\" and therefore a political process, so some definitions set out common goals and values. The  speaks of \"a sustainable global society founded on respect for nature, universal human rights, economic justice, and a culture of peace\". This suggested a more complex figure of sustainability, which included the importance of the domain of 'politics'.\nMore than that, sustainability implies responsible and proactive decision-making and innovation that minimizes negative impact and maintains balance between ecological resilience, economic prosperity, political justice and cultural vibrancy to ensure a desirable planet for all species now and in the future. Specific types of sustainability include, ,  or . Understanding sustainable development is important but without clear targets it remains an unfocused term like \"liberty\" or \"justice\". It has also been described as a \"dialogue of values that challenge the sociology of development\".\nWhile the  identified principles and treaties on sustainable development, including economic development, , and environmental protection, it continued using three domains: economics, environment, and social sustainability. More recently, using a systematic domain model that responds to the debates over the last decade, the  approach distinguished four domains of economic, ecological, political and ; this in accord with the , , , and in particular the  which specifies  as the  domain of sustainable development. The model is now being used by organizations such as the  Cities Programme and Metropolis. In the case of Metropolis, this approach does not mean adding a fourth domain of culture to the dominant  figure of the economy, environment and the social. Rather, it involves treating all four domains\u2014economy, ecology, politics, and culture\u2014as social (including economics) and distinguishing between ecology (as the intersection of the human and natural worlds) and the environment as that which goes far beyond what we as humans can ever know.\nAnother model suggests humans' attempt to achieve all of their needs and aspirations via seven modalities: economy, community, occupational groups, government, environment, culture, and physiology. From the global to the individual human scale, each of the seven modalities can be viewed across seven hierarchical levels. Human sustainability can be achieved by attaining sustainability in all levels of the seven modalities.\nIntegral elements of sustainability are research and innovation activities. A telling example is the . It aims at defining and implementing a transformative agenda to greening the economy and the society as a whole so to make them sustainable. Research and innovation in Europe are financially supported by the programme , which is also open to participation worldwide.\nEncouraging good farming practices ensures farmers fully benefit from the environment and at the same time conserving it for future generations. Additionally, instigating innovative and sustainable travel and transportation solutions must play a vital role in this process. During the 2019 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Activist Rodrigo Ayala brought up a couple mechanisms to allow sustainability to become integrated into society. The need to gather as a society to plant more trees in our backyards is necessary and therefore a task for the next generation.\n in ecology is the capacity of an ecosystem to absorb disturbance and still retain its basic structure and viability. Resilience-thinking evolved from the need to manage interactions between human-constructed systems and natural ecosystems sustainably even though to  a definition remains elusive. Resilience-thinking addresses how much planetary ecological systems can withstand assault from human disturbances and still deliver the service's current and future generations need from them.  It is also concerned with commitment from  policymakers to promote and manage essential planetary ecological resources to promote resilience and achieve sustainability of these essential resources for benefit of future generations of life. The resiliency of an ecosystem, and thereby, its sustainability, can be reasonably measured at  or events where the combination of  occurring  forces (, water, soil, , vegetation, and ) interact with the energy released into the ecosystem from disturbances.\nA practical view of sustainability is  that maintain processes of  indefinitely by replacing resources used by actions of people with resources of equal or greater value by those same people without degrading or endangering natural biotic systems. In this way, sustainability can be concretely measured in human projects if there is a transparent accounting of the resources put back into the ecosystem to replace those displaced. In nature, the accounting occurs naturally through a process of  as an ecosystem returns to  from an external disturbance. The adaptation is a multi-stage process that begins with the disturbance event (earthquake, volcanic eruption, hurricane, tornado, flood, or thunderstorm), followed by , utilization, or  of the  or energies that the external forces created.\nIn analysing systems such as urban and national parks, dams, farms and gardens, theme parks, open-pit mines, water catchments, one way to look at the relationship between sustainability and resiliency is to view the former with a long-term vision and resiliency as the capacity of human engineers to respond to immediate environmental events.\nThe history of sustainability traces human-dominated  systems from the earliest  to the present day. This history is characterized by the increased regional success of a particular , followed by crises that were either resolved, producing sustainability, or not, leading to decline.\nIn early human history, the use of fire and desire for specific foods may have altered the natural composition of plant and animal communities. Between 8,000 and 10,000 years ago,  emerged which depended largely on their  and the creation of a \"structure of permanence\".\nThe Western  of the 18th to 19th centuries tapped into the vast growth potential of the energy in .  was used to power ever more efficient engines and later to generate electricity. Modern  systems and advances in medicine protected large populations from disease. In the mid-20th century, a gathering  pointed out that there were environmental costs associated with the many material benefits that were now being enjoyed. In the late 20th century, environmental problems became global in scale. The 1973 and 1979  demonstrated the extent to which the global community had become dependent on non-renewable energy resources.\nIn the 1970s, the ecological footprint of humanity exceeded the carrying capacity of earth, therefore the mode of life of humanity became unsustainable.\nIn the 21st century, there is increasing global awareness of the threat posed by the human , produced largely by forest clearing and the burning of fossil fuels.\nThere are at least 3 letters from the scientific community about the growing threat to Sustainability and ways to remove the threat.\nThe philosophical and analytic framework of sustainability draws on and connects with many different disciplines and fields; in recent years an area that has come to be called  has emerged.\nSustainability is studied and managed over many scales (levels or frames of reference) of time and space and in many contexts of environmental, social and economic organizations. The focus ranges from the total  (sustainability) of planet Earth to the sustainability of economic sectors, ecosystems, countries, municipalities, neighborhood, home gardens, individual lives, individual goods, and services, occupations, lifestyles, behavior patterns and so on. In short, it can entail the full compass of biological and human activity or any part of it. As Daniel Botkin, author and environmentalist has stated: \"We see a landscape that is always in flux, changing over many scales of time and space.\"\nThe sheer size and complexity of the planetary ecosystem has proven problematic for the design of practical measures to reach global sustainability. To shed light on the big picture, explorer and sustainability campaigner  has drawn parallels to other, more tangible . For example, he likens human existence on Earth\u00a0\u2014 isolated as the planet is in space, whereby people cannot be evacuated to relieve population pressure and resources cannot be imported to prevent accelerated \u00a0\u2014 to life at sea on a small boat isolated by water. In both cases, he argues, exercising the  is a key factor in survival.\nA major driver of human impact on Earth systems is the destruction of  , and especially, the Earth's ecosystems. The environmental impact of a community or humankind as a whole depends both on population and impact per person, which in turn depends in complex ways on what resources are being used, whether or not those resources are renewable, and the scale of the human activity relative to the carrying capacity of the ecosystems involved. Careful resource management can be applied at many scales, from economic sectors like agriculture, manufacturing, and industry, to work organizations, the consumption patterns of households and individuals and to the resource demands of individual goods and services.\nOne of the initial attempts to express human impact mathematically was developed in the 1970s and is called the  formula. This formulation attempts to explain human consumption in terms of three components:  numbers, levels of  (which it terms \"affluence\", although the usage is different), and impact per unit of resource use (which is termed \"technology\", because this impact depends on the  used). The equation is expressed:\n\nAccording to the , human consumption, with current policy, by the year 2100 should be 7 times bigger than in the year 2010.\nIn recent years, concepts based on (re-)cycling resources are increasingly gaining importance. The most prominent among these concepts might be the , with its comprehensive support by the Chinese and the European Union. There is also a broad range of similar concepts or schools of thought, including cradle-to-cradle laws of ecology, looped and performance economy, regenerative design, industrial ecology, biomimicry, and the blue economy. These concepts seem intuitively to be more sustainable than the current linear economic system. The reduction of resource inputs into and waste and emission leakage out of the system reduces resource depletion and environmental pollution. However, these simple assumptions are not sufficient to deal with the involved systemic complexity and disregards potential trade-offs. For example, the social dimension of sustainability seems to be only marginally addressed in many publications on the Circular Economy, and some cases require different or additional strategies, such as purchasing new, more energy-efficient equipment. A review of a team of researchers from Cambridge and TU Delft identified eight different relationship types between sustainability and the circular economy, namely:\nSustainability measurement is the quantitative basis for the informed management of sustainability. The metrics used for the measurement of sustainability (involving the sustainability of environmental, social and economic domains, both individually and in various combinations) are evolving: they include , benchmarks, audits,  systems like  and , indexes and accounting, as well as assessment, appraisal and other reporting systems. They are applied over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales.\nSome of the best known and most widely used sustainability measures include corporate , , World Sustainability Society, , and estimates of the quality of sustainability governance for individual countries using the  and .\nTwo of the most known ways to measure environmental sustainability is  and . If the boundaries are not crossed and the ecological footprint is not exceeding the carrying capacity of the biosphere, the mode of life of humanity is sustainable.\nAccording to the most recent (July 2015) revision of the official United Nations World Population Prospects, the  is projected to reach 8.5 billion by 2030, up from the current 7.3 billion (July 2015), to exceed 9 billion people by 2050, and to reach 11.2 billion by the year 2100. Most of the increase will be in  whose population is projected to rise from 5.6 billion in 2009 to 7.9 billion in 2050. This increase will be distributed among the population aged 15\u201359 (1.2 billion) and 60 or over (1.1 billion) because the number of children under age 15 in developing countries is predicted to decrease. In contrast, the population of the more  is expected to undergo only slight increase from 1.23 billion to 1.28 billion, and this would have declined to 1.15 billion but for a projected net migration from developing to developed countries, which is expected to average 2.4 million persons annually from 2009 to 2050. Long-term estimates in 2004 of global population suggest a peak at around 2070 of nine to ten billion people, and then a slow decrease to 8.4 billion by 2100.\nEmerging economies like those of China and India aspire to the living standards of the Western world, as does the non-industrialized world in general. It is the combination of population increase in the developing world and unsustainable consumption levels in the developed world that poses a stark challenge to sustainability.\nAt the global scale, scientific data now indicates that humans are living beyond the  of planet Earth and that this cannot continue indefinitely. This scientific evidence comes from many sources but is presented in detail in the  and the  framework. An early detailed examination of global limits was published in the 1972 book , which has prompted follow-up commentary and analysis. A 2012 review in  by 22 international researchers expressed concerns that the Earth may be \"approaching a state shift\" in its biosphere.\nThe  measures human consumption in terms of the biologically productive land and sea area needed to provide for all the competing demands on nature, including the provision of food, fiber, the accommodation of urban infrastructure and the absorption of waste, including carbon from burning fossil fuel. In 2019, it required on average 2.8  per person worldwide, 75% more than the biological capacity of 1.6 global hectares available on this planet per person (this space includes the space needed for wild species). The resulting  must be met from unsustainable  sources and these are obtained in three ways: embedded in the goods and services of world trade; taken from the past (e.g. ); or borrowed from the future as unsustainable resource usage (e.g. by   and ).\nThe figure (right) examines sustainability at the scale of individual countries by contrasting their Ecological Footprint with their UN  (a measure of standard of living). The graph shows what is necessary for countries to maintain an acceptable standard of living for their citizens while, at the same time, maintaining sustainable resource use. The general trend is for higher standards of living to become less sustainable. As always,  has a marked influence on levels of consumption and the efficiency of resource use. The sustainability goal is to raise the global standard of living without increasing the use of resources beyond globally sustainable levels; that is, to not exceed \"one planet\" consumption. The information generated by reports at the national, regional and city scales confirm the global trend towards societies that are becoming less sustainable over time.\n economist , a  in  and a  of , has argued that the carrying capacity of Earth \u2014 that is, Earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels \u2014 is bound to decrease sometime in the future as Earth's finite stock of mineral resources is presently being extracted and put to use. Leading ecological economist and  , a student of Georgescu-Roegen, has .\nAt the enterprise scale, carrying capacity now also plays a critical role in making it possible to measure and report the sustainability performance of individual organizations.  This is most clearly demonstrated through use of  (CBS) tools, methods and metrics, including the MultiCapital Scorecard, which have been in development since 2005.  Contrary to many other mainstream approaches to measuring the sustainability performance of organizations \u2013 which tend to be more incrementalist in form \u2013 CBS is explicitly tied to social, environmental and economic limits and thresholds in the world.  Thus, rather than simply measure and report changes in relative terms from one period to another, CBS makes it possible to compare the impacts of organizations to organization-specific norms, standards or thresholds for what they (the impacts) would have to be in order to be empirically sustainable (i.e., which if generalized to a larger population would not fail to maintain the sufficiency of vital resources for human or non-human well-being).\nAt a fundamental level,  and  set an upper limit on the number and mass of organisms in any ecosystem. Human impacts on the Earth are demonstrated in a general way through detrimental changes in the global biogeochemical cycles of chemicals that are critical to life, most notably those of , , ,  and .\nThe  is an international synthesis by over 1000 of the world's leading biological scientists that analyzes the state of the Earth's  and provides summaries and guidelines for decision-makers.

The report was finalized in Paris. The main conclusions:\n1. Over the last 50 years, the state of nature has deteriorated at an unprecedented and accelerating rate.\n2. The main drivers of this deterioration have been changes in land and sea use, exploitation of living beings, climate change, pollution, and invasive species. These five drivers, in turn, are caused by societal behaviors, from consumption to governance.\n3.

However, a sustainable campus should integrate the educational and managerial aspects of the sustainable development along with its three dimensions (environmental, economical, social responsibility) into its different practices.\nHealthy ecosystems provide vital goods and services to humans and other organisms. There are two major ways of reducing negative human impact and enhancing  and the first of these is . This direct approach is based largely on information gained from ,  and .\nHowever, this is management at the end of a long series of indirect causal factors that are initiated by human , so a second approach is through demand management of human resource use.\nManagement of human consumption of resources is an indirect approach based largely on information gained from . Herman Daly has suggested three broad criteria for ecological sustainability: renewable resources should provide a  (the rate of harvest should not exceed the rate of regeneration); for non-renewable resources there should be equivalent development of renewable substitutes; waste generation should not exceed the assimilative capacity of the environment.\nAt the global scale and in the broadest sense environmental management involves the ,  systems, land and , but following the sustainability principle of scale it can be equally applied to any ecosystem from a tropical rainforest to a home garden. In 2019, 2 weeks before the elections to the European Parliament, the  stated that the  is unsustainable in his current mode of life and economy and asked him to fix it by \"Shift to , make Europe climate-neutral by 2040, restore our Nature, protect the Ocean, invest in a sustainable future\"\nAt a March 2009 meeting of the , 2,500 climate experts from 80 countries issued a keynote statement that there is now \"no excuse\" for failing to act on global warming and that without strong carbon reduction \"abrupt or irreversible\" shifts in climate may occur that \"will be very difficult for contemporary societies to cope with\".

One of the most important projects is the  that should stop the expansion of  desert to the south. By 2018 only 15% of it is accomplished, but there are already many positive effects, which include: \"Over 12 million acres (5 million hectares) of degraded land has been restored in Nigeria; roughly 30 million acres of drought-resistant trees have been planted across Senegal; and a whopping 37 million acres of land has been restored in Ethiopia \u2013 just to name a few of the states involved.\" \"many groundwater wells refilled with drinking water, rural towns with additional food supplies, and new sources of work and income for villagers, thanks to the need for tree maintenance\".\nWater covers 71% of the Earth's surface. Of this, 97.5% is the salty water of the  and only 2.5% freshwater, most of which is locked up in the . The remaining freshwater is found in glaciers, lakes, rivers, wetlands, the soil, aquifers, and atmosphere. Due to the water cycle, freshwater supply is continually replenished by precipitation, however, there is still a limited amount necessitating the management of this resource. Awareness of the global importance of preserving water for  has only recently emerged as, during the 20th century, more than half the world's  have been lost along with their valuable environmental services. Increasing  pollutes clean water supplies and much of the world still do not have access to clean, safe water. Greater emphasis is now being placed on the improved management of blue (harvestable) and green (soil water available for plant use) water, and this applies at all scales of water management.\n circulation patterns have a strong influence on  and  and, in turn, the food supply of both humans and other organisms. Scientists have warned of the possibility, under the influence of climate change, of a sudden alteration in circulation patterns of  that could drastically alter the climate in some regions of the globe. Ten per cent of the world's population\u2014about 600 million people\u2014live in low-lying areas vulnerable to sea-level rise.\nLoss of biodiversity stems largely from the habitat loss and fragmentation produced by the human appropriation of land for development, forestry and agriculture as  is progressively converted to man-made capital.

Present-day forests occupy about a quarter of the world's ice-free land with about half of these occurring in the tropics. In temperate and boreal regions forest area is gradually increasing (except for Siberia), but  in the tropics is of major concern.\n is essential to life. Feeding more than seven billion human bodies takes a heavy toll on the Earth's resources. This begins with the appropriation of about 38% of the Earth's land surface and about 20% of its net primary productivity. Added to this are the resource-hungry activities of industrial agribusiness\u2014everything from the crop need for irrigation water, synthetic  and  to the resource costs of food packaging, transport (now a major part of global trade) and retail. Environmental problems associated with  and  are now being addressed through such movements as sustainable agriculture,  and more sustainable business practices.\nThe underlying driver of direct human impacts on the environment is human consumption. This impact is reduced by not only consuming less but also making the full cycle of production, use, and disposal more sustainable. Consumption of goods and services can be analyzed and managed at all scales through the chain of consumption, starting with the effects of individual lifestyle choices and spending patterns, through to the resource demands of specific goods and services, the impacts of economic sectors, through national economies to the global economy. Analysis of consumption patterns relates resource use to the environmental, social and economic impacts at the scale or context under investigation. The ideas of embodied resource use (the total resources needed to produce a product or service), , and  are important tools for understanding the impacts of consumption. Key resource categories relating to human needs are , , materials and water.\nIn 2010, the , hosted by the  (UNEP), published the first global scientific assessment on the impacts of consumption and production and identified priority actions for developed and developing countries. The study found that the most critical impacts are related to  health, human health and . From a production perspective, it found that fossil-fuel combustion processes, agriculture and  have the most important impacts. Meanwhile, from a final  perspective, it found that household consumption related to mobility, shelter, food, and energy-using products causes the majority of  impacts of consumption.\nThe Sun's energy, stored by plants () during , passes through the  to other organisms to ultimately power all living processes. Since the  the concentrated energy of the  stored in fossilized plants as  has been a major driver of  which, in turn, has been the source of both economic and political power. In 2007 climate scientists of the  concluded that there was at least a 90% probability that atmospheric increase in CO was human-induced, mostly as a result of fossil fuel emissions but, to a lesser extent from changes in land use. Stabilizing the world's climate will require high-income countries to reduce their emissions by 60\u201390% over 2006 levels by 2050 which should hold CO levels at 450\u2013650\u00a0ppm from current levels of about 380\u00a0ppm. Above this level, temperatures could rise by more than 2\u00a0\u00b0C to produce \"catastrophic\" . Reduction of current CO levels must be achieved against a background of global population increase and developing countries aspiring to energy-intensive high consumption Western lifestyles.\nReducing greenhouse emissions, is being tackled at all scales, ranging from tracking the passage of carbon through the  to the , developing less carbon-hungry technology and transport systems and attempts by individuals to lead  lifestyles by monitoring the fossil fuel use embodied in all the goods and services they use.  of  such as  and energy storage systems such as , , and  are necessary to store power from transient  sources including emerging renewables such as .\nRenewable energy also has some environmental impacts.

In the decade 1951\u201360 human water withdrawals were four times greater than the previous decade. This rapid increase resulted from scientific and technological developments impacting through the \u2014especially the increase in irrigated land, growth in industrial and power sectors, and intensive  construction on all continents. This altered the water cycle of  and , affected their  and had a significant impact on the global water cycle. Currently towards 35% of human water use is unsustainable, drawing on diminishing aquifers and reducing the flows of major rivers: this percentage is likely to increase if climate change impacts become more severe,  increase, aquifers become progressively depleted and supplies become polluted and unsanitary. From 1961 to 2001 water demand doubled\u2014agricultural use increased by 75%, industrial use by more than 200%, and domestic use more than 400%. In the 1990s it was estimated that humans were using 40\u201350% of the globally available freshwater in the approximate proportion of 70% for agriculture, 22% for , and 8% for domestic purposes with total use progressively increasing.\n is being improved on a global scale by increased , improved infrastructure, improved water  of agriculture, minimising the water intensity (embodied water) of goods and services, addressing shortages in the non-industrialized world, concentrating food production in areas of high productivity, and planning for climate change, such as through flexible system design. A promising direction towards sustainable development is to design systems that are flexible and reversible. At the local level, people are becoming more self-sufficient by harvesting rainwater and reducing use of mains water.\nThe  (APHA) defines a \"sustainable food system\" as \"one that provides healthy food to meet current food needs while maintaining healthy ecosystems that can also provide food for generations to come with minimal negative impact to the environment. A sustainable food system also encourages local production and distribution infrastructures and makes nutritious food available, accessible, and affordable to all. Further, it is humane and just, protecting farmers and other workers, consumers, and communities.\"\nIndustrial agriculture cause environmental impacts, health problem associated with   in the rich world and  in the poor world.

Included here are raw materials, minerals, synthetic chemicals (including ), manufactured products, food, living organisms, and waste. By 2050, humanity could consume an estimated 140 billion tons of minerals, ores, fossil fuels and biomass per year (three times its current amount) unless the economic growth rate is decoupled from the rate of natural . Developed countries' citizens consume an average of 16 tons of those four key resources per capita, ranging up to 40 or more tons per person in some developed countries with resource consumption levels far beyond what is likely sustainable.\nSustainable use of materials has targeted the idea of , converting the linear path of materials (extraction, use, disposal in landfill) to a  that reuses materials as much as possible, much like the cycling and reuse of waste in nature. This approach is supported by  and the increasing use of  at all levels, especially individual countries and the global economy. The use of sustainable biomaterials that come from renewable sources and that can be recycled is preferred to the use on non-renewables from a life cycle standpoint.\n production has escalated following the stimulus it received during the Second World War. Chemical production includes everything from herbicides, pesticides, and fertilizers to domestic chemicals and hazardous substances. Apart from the build-up of  emissions in the atmosphere, chemicals of particular concern include: , , ,  and all harmful chemicals capable of . Although most synthetic chemicals are harmless there needs to be rigorous testing of new chemicals, in all countries, for adverse environmental and health effects. International legislation has been established to deal with the global distribution and management of .

According to the report, plastic will contribute  in the equivalent of 850 million tons of  () to the atmosphere in 2019. In the current trend, annual emissions will grow to 1.34 billion tons by 2030. By 2050 plastic could emit 56 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions, as much as 14 percent of the earth's remaining carbon budget.\nOn one account, sustainability \"concerns the specification of a set of actions to be taken by present persons that will not diminish the prospects of future persons to enjoy levels of consumption, wealth, utility, or welfare comparable to those enjoyed by present persons\". Sustainability interfaces with economics through the social and ecological consequences of economic activity. Sustainability economics represents: \"...\u00a0a broad interpretation of ecological economics where environmental and ecological variables and issues are basic but part of a multidimensional perspective. Social, cultural, health-related and monetary/financial aspects have to be integrated into the analysis.\" However, the concept of sustainability is much broader than the concepts of sustained yield of welfare, resources, or profit margins. At present, the average per capita consumption of people in the developing world is sustainable but population numbers are increasing and individuals are aspiring to high-consumption Western lifestyles. The developed world population is only increasing slightly but consumption levels are unsustainable. The challenge for sustainability is to curb and manage Western consumption while raising the standard of living of the developing world without increasing its resource use and environmental impact. This must be done by using strategies and technology that break the link between, on the one hand, economic growth and on the other,  and resource depletion.\nA recent UNEP report proposes a  defined as one that \"improves human well-being and social equity, while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities\": it \"does not favor one political perspective over another but works to minimize excessive depletion of \". The report makes three key findings: \"that greening not only generates increases in wealth, in particular, a gain in ecological commons or natural capital but also (over a period of six years) produces a higher rate of GDP growth\"; that there is \"an inextricable link between poverty eradication and better maintenance and conservation of the ecological commons, arising from the benefit flows from natural capital that are received directly by the poor\"; \"in the transition to a green economy, new jobs are created, which in time exceed the losses in \"brown economy\" jobs. However, there is a period of job losses in transition, which requires investment in re-skilling and re-educating the workforce\".\nSeveral key areas have been targeted for economic analysis and reform: the environmental effects of unconstrained economic growth; the consequences of nature being treated as an economic ; and the possibility of an economics that takes greater account of the social and environmental consequences of market behavior.\nHistorically there has been a close correlation between  and : as communities grow, so the environment declines. This trend is clearly demonstrated on graphs of human population numbers, economic growth, and environmental indicators.</ref> Unsustainable economic growth has been starkly compared to the malignant growth of a cancer because it eats away at the Earth's  which are its life-support system. There is a concern that, unless resource use is checked, modern global civilization will follow the path of ancient civilizations that collapsed through  of their resource base. While conventional economics is concerned largely with economic growth and the efficient allocation of resources, ecological economics has the explicit goal of sustainable scale (rather than continual growth),  and efficient allocation, in that order. The  states that \"business cannot succeed in societies that fail\".\nIn  and  fields, the term  is becoming increasingly used in the context of economic production and environmental quality. When used in this way, it refers to the ability of an economy to grow without incurring corresponding increases in environmental pressure. Ecological economics includes the study of societal metabolism, the throughput of resources that enter and exit the economic system in relation to . An economy that can sustain GDP growth without harming the environment is said to be decoupled. Exactly how, if, or to what extent this can be achieved is a subject of much debate. In 2011 the , hosted by the  (UNEP), warned that by 2050 the human race could be devouring 140 billion tons of minerals, ores, fossil fuels and biomass per year\u2014three times its current rate of consumption\u2014unless nations can make serious attempts at decoupling. The report noted that citizens of developed countries consume an average of 16 tons of those four key resources per capita per annum (ranging up to 40 or more tons per person in some developed countries). By comparison, the average person in India today consumes four tons per year. Sustainability studies analyse ways to reduce  (the amount of resource (e.g. water, energy, or materials) needed for the production, consumption and disposal of a unit of good or service) whether this be achieved from improved economic management, product design, or new technology.\nThere are conflicting views on whether improvements in technological efficiency and innovation will enable a complete decoupling of economic growth from environmental degradation. On the one hand, it has been claimed repeatedly by efficiency experts that resource use intensity (i.e., energy and materials use per unit ) could in principle be reduced by at least four or five-fold, thereby allowing for continued economic growth without increasing resource depletion and associated pollution. On the other hand, an extensive historical analysis of technological efficiency improvements has conclusively shown that improvements in the efficiency of the use of energy and materials were almost always outpaced by economic growth, in large part because of the  or  resulting in a net increase in resource use and associated pollution. Furthermore, there are inherent thermodynamic (i.e., ) and practical limits to all efficiency improvements. For example, there are certain minimum unavoidable material requirements for growing food, and there are limits to making automobiles, houses, furniture, and other products lighter and thinner without the risk of losing their necessary functions. Since it is both theoretically and practically impossible to increase resource use efficiencies indefinitely, it is equally impossible to have continued and infinite economic growth without a concomitant increase in resource depletion and environmental pollution, i.e., economic growth and resource depletion can be decoupled to some degree over the short run but not the long run. Consequently, long-term sustainability requires the transition to a  in which total GDP remains more or less constant, as has been advocated for decades by  and others in the  community.\nA different proposed solution to partially decouple economic growth from environmental degradation is the  approach. This approach views \"restore\" as a fourth component to the common reduce, reuse, recycle motto. Participants in such efforts are encouraged to voluntarily donate towards nature conservation a small fraction of the financial savings they experience through a more frugal use of resources. These financial savings would normally lead to rebound effects, but a theoretical analysis suggests that donating even a small fraction of the experienced savings can potentially more than eliminate rebound effects.\nThe economic importance of nature is indicated by the use of the expression  to highlight the market relevance of an increasingly scarce natural world that can no longer be regarded as both unlimited and free. In general, as a  or service becomes more scarce the  increases and this acts as a restraint that encourages frugality, technical innovation and alternative products. However, this only applies when the product or service falls within the market system. As ecosystem services are generally treated as economic  they are unpriced and therefore overused and degraded, a situation sometimes referred to as the .\nOne approach to this dilemma has been the attempt to \"internalize\" these \"externalities\" by using market strategies like  and incentives, tradable permits for carbon, and the encouragement of .  associated with  (LETS), a  and  have also been promoted as a way of supporting local economies and the environment.  is another market-based attempt to address issues of equity and the environment. The global recession and a range of associated government policies are likely to bring the biggest annual fall in the world's carbon dioxide emissions in 40 years.\nTreating the environment as an externality may generate short-term profit at the expense of sustainability.  practices, on the other hand, integrate ecological concerns with social and economic ones (i.e., the ). The growth that depletes ecosystem services is sometimes termed \"\" as it leads to a decline in . Minimizing such growth can provide opportunities for local businesses. For example, industrial waste can be treated as an \"economic resource in the wrong place\". The benefits of  include savings from disposal costs, fewer environmental penalties, and reduced liability insurance. This may lead to increased market share due to an improved public image. Energy efficiency can also increase profits by reducing costs.\nThe idea of sustainability as a business opportunity has led to the formation of organizations such as the Sustainability Consortium of the , the Sustainable Business Institute, and the World Council for Sustainable Development. The expansion of sustainable business opportunities can contribute to  through the introduction of  workers. Research focusing on progressive corporate leaders who have integrated sustainability into commercial strategy has yielded a leadership competency model for sustainability, and led to emergence of the concept of \"embedded sustainability\"\u2014defined by its authors Chris Laszlo and  as \"incorporation of environmental, health, and social value into the core business with no trade-off in price or quality\u2014in other words, with no social or green premium\". Laszlo and Zhexembayeva's research showed that embedded sustainability offers at least seven distinct opportunities for business value creation: a) better risk-management, b) increased efficiency through reduced waste and resource use, c) better product differentiation, d) new market entrances, e) enhanced brand and reputation, f) greater opportunity to influence industry standards, and g) greater opportunity for radical innovation. 's 2014 research further suggested that innovation driven by resource depletion can result in fundamental advantages for company products and services, as well as the company strategy as a whole, when right principles of innovation are applied.\nMarket approach refers to incentive-based policy that encourages conservative practices or pollution reduction strategies. Types of Market instruments are Pollution charge, Subsidies, Deposit/refund systems and Pollution permit trading systems.\nOne school of thought, often labeled  or ecological Marxism, asserts that the  is fundamentally incompatible with the ecological and social requirements of sustainability. This theory rests on the premises that:\nThus, according to this analysis:\nBy this logic, market-based solutions to ecological crises (, , ) are rejected as technical tweaks that do not confront capitalism's structural failures. \"Low-risk\" technology/science-based solutions such as , , and increases in  are seen as necessary but insufficient. \"High-risk\" technological solutions such as  and  are entirely rejected.

Ecosocialists claim that the general unwillingness of capitalists to tolerate\u2014and capitalist governments to implement\u2014constraints on maximum profit (such as ecotaxes or preservation and conservation measures) renders  incapable of facilitating large-scale change: \"History teaches us that although capitalism has at times responded to environmental movements ... at a certain point, at which the system's underlying accumulation drive is affected, its resistance to environmental demands stiffens.\" They also note that, up until the event of total , destruction caused by natural disasters generally causes an increase in economic growth and accumulation; thus, capitalists have no foreseeable motivation to reduce the probability of disasters (i.e. convert to sustainable/ecological production).\nEcosocialists advocate for the  succession of capitalism by ecosocialism\u2014an  economic/political/social structure designed to harmonize human society with non-human ecology and to fulfill \u2014as the only sufficient solution to the present-day ecological crisis, and hence the only path towards sustainability. Sustainability is viewed not as a domain exclusive to scientists, environmental activists, and business leaders but as a holistic project that must involve the whole of humanity redefining its place in : \"What every environmentalist needs to know ... is that capitalism is not the solution but the problem, and that if humanity is going to survive this crisis, it will do so because it has exercised its capacity for human freedom, through social struggle, in order to create a whole new world\u2014in coevolution with the planet.\"\nSustainability issues are generally expressed in  and environmental terms, as well as in ethical terms of , but implementing change is a social challenge that entails, among other things,  and national ,  and transport, local and individual  and . \"The relationship between human rights and human development,  and environmental justice, global poverty and citizen action, suggest that responsible global citizenship is an inescapable element of what may at first glance seem to be simply matters of personal consumer and moral choice.\"\nSocial disruptions like ,  and  divert resources from areas of greatest human need, damage the capacity of societies to plan for the future, and generally threaten human well-being and the environment. Broad-based strategies for more sustainable social systems include: improved education and the political empowerment of women, especially in developing countries; greater regard for social justice, notably equity between rich and poor both within and between countries; and intergenerational equity. Depletion of natural resources including fresh water increases the likelihood of \"resource wars\". This aspect of sustainability has been referred to as  and creates a clear need for  to manage resources such as aquifers and rivers which span political boundaries, and to protect shared global systems including  and the .\nTo achieve sustainability,  will probably be needed, because  is one of the main factors that determine the . Without peace and international cooperation, a country that will limit its economic growth will achieve lower military capability. If there are countries that continue to grow economically, the result may be the conquest of the first country by the ones that continue to grow. In such conditions there is very low probability that a  can exist.  will continue what can pose problems to sustainability.\nIn his book ,  argue that , while linked with the creation of a ruling class and social stratification, create the possibility to , what means that people could be specialized on warfare, making weapons, and this enabled the countries with more surplus product to conquest countries with less.\nA major hurdle to achieve sustainability is the alleviation of poverty. It has been widely acknowledged that poverty is one source of environmental degradation. Such acknowledgment has been made by the  and the Millennium Development Goals. There is a growing realization in national governments and multilateral institutions that it is impossible to separate economic development issues from environment issues: according to the Brundtland report, \"poverty is a major cause and effect of global environmental problems. It is therefore futile to attempt to deal with environmental problems without a broader perspective that encompasses the factors underlying world poverty and international inequality.\" Individuals living in poverty tend to rely heavily on their local ecosystem as a source for basic needs (such as nutrition and medicine) and general well-being. As population growth continues to increase, increasing pressure is being placed on the local ecosystem to provide these basic essentials. According to the UN Population Fund, high fertility and poverty have been strongly correlated, and the world's poorest countries also have the highest fertility and  rates. The word sustainability is also used widely by western country development agencies and international charities to focus their poverty alleviation efforts in ways that can be sustained by the local populace and its environment. For example, teaching  to the poor by boiling their water with , would not generally be considered a sustainable strategy, whereas using   would be. Also, sustainable  can involve the  of materials, such as the use of   for lumber where deforestation has devastated a country's timber base. Another example of sustainable practices in poverty alleviation is the use of exported recycled materials from developed to developing countries, such as 's use of wire rope from shipping container  to act as the structural wire rope for  that cross rivers in poor rural areas in Asia and Africa.\nAccording to , the idea that humans must dominate nature is common in  societies. Bookchin contends that  and  relationships, if unchecked, can reduce the planet to a mere resource to be exploited. Nature is thus treated as a : \"The plundering of the human spirit by the market place is paralleled by the plundering of the earth by capital.\" , founded by Bookchin, is based on the conviction that nearly all of humanity's present ecological problems originate in, indeed are mere symptoms of, dysfunctional social arrangements. Whereas most authors proceed as if our ecological problems can be fixed by implementing recommendations which stem from physical, biological, economic, etc., studies, Bookchin's claim is that these problems can only be resolved by understanding the underlying social processes and intervening in those processes by applying the concepts and methods of the social sciences.\nA pure capitalist approach has also been criticized in  by referring to  as \"the greatest example of  we have ever seen.\"\nWith the United States of America, The Government and the Economy has had a long-lasting impact on the environment, but in a problematic way. Policy issues regarding the environment have shown that the country regards the protection of the environment as a \"second-hand issue\". One causation from this is a certain dilemma called \"collective action problem\" or collective action dilemmas.\" These occur when individuals, firms, or governments would be better off if they cooperated in the pursuit of a common goal, but, for one reason or another, one or more of those involved choose a less optimal course of action. Matthew Potoski and Aseem Prakash have made a model establishing 4 cells that are explaining each benefit for the government or the economic process. For the government, one cost might be the loss of public confidence and trust, while a firm might lose market share and profitability \n is a movement founded by  that establishes principles for the well-being of all life on Earth and the richness and diversity of life forms. The movement advocates, among other things, a substantial decrease in human population and consumption along with the reduction of human interference with the nonhuman world. To achieve this, deep ecologists advocate policies for basic economic, technological, and ideological structures that will improve the  rather than the . Those who subscribe to these principles are obliged to make the necessary change happen.

In Sweden, more than 70 cities and towns\u201425 percent of all municipalities in the country\u2014have adopted a common set of  and implemented these systematically throughout their municipal operations. There are now twelve eco-municipalities in the United States and the  has adopted sustainability objectives based on the same principles.\nThere is a wealth of advice available to individuals wishing to reduce their personal and social impact on the environment through small, inexpensive and easily achievable steps. But the transition required to reduce global human consumption to within sustainable limits involves much larger changes, at all levels and contexts of society. The  has recognised the central role of education, and have declared a , 2005\u20132014, which aims to \"challenge us all to adopt new behaviours and practices to secure our future\". The  proposes a strategy for sustainability that goes beyond education to tackle underlying individualistic and materialistic  head-on and strengthen people's connections with the natural world.\nApplication of  requires stakeholders to look at human and labor rights, prevention of human trafficking, and other human rights risks. These issues should be considered in production and procurement of various worldwide commodities. The international community has identified many industries whose practices have been known to violate social sustainability, and many of these industries have organizations in place that aid in verifying the social sustainability of products and services. The  (financial industry),  (garments), and Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition are examples of such organizations and initiatives. Resources are also available for verifying the life-cycle of products and the producer or vendor level, such as  for cleaning products, -140 for carpet production, and even labeling of  in the United States.\nThe  recognized that achieving sustainability is impossible without addressing health issues. Sustainable world is needed for sustainable health and some ways to reach more GDP (part of the ) can harm health. There is a rise in some interconnected health and sustainability problems, for example, in food production. Measures for achieving environmental sustainability can improve health\nA report from the Lancet commission says the same. The experts write: \" What we're doing now is unsustainable,\" \"The only thing we can hope is that a sense of urgency will permeate. We're running out of time.\" \"Until now, undernutrition and obesity have been seen as polar opposites of either too few or too many calories,\" \"In reality, they are both driven by the same unhealthy, inequitable food systems, underpinned by the same political economy that is single-focused on economic growth, and ignores the negative health and equity outcomes. Climate change has the same story of profits and power,\"\nObesity was a medical problem for people who  food and worked too little already in ancient Rome, and its impact slowly grew through history.\nThe cultural dimension of sustainability is known as . Important in the advancement of this notion have been the , , and in particular their  and  (now also known as Culture 21), a program for  developed in 2002\u20132004 and coordinated by  (UCLG), created in 2004.\nSustainability is central to underpinning feelings of authenticity in tourism. Experiences can be enhanced when substituting the contrived for the genuine, and at the same time inspire a potentially deleterious appetite for follow-up visits to the real thing: objectively authentic sites untouched by repair or rejuvenation. Feelings of authenticity at a tourist site are thus implicitly linked to sustainable tourism; as the maximisation of existential \"felt\" authenticity at sites of limited historical provenance increases the likelihood of return visits.\nIn 2009 a group of scientists leaded by  from the  and  from the  described nine . Transgressing even one of them can be dangerous to sustainability. Those boundaries are:\nIn 2015, the scientists published an update. They changed the name of the boundary \"Loss of biodeversity\" to \"Change in biosphere integrity\" meaning that not only the number of species but also the functionning of the biosphere as a whole is important and \"Chemical pollution\" to \"Introduction of novel entities,\" including in it not only pollution but also \"organic pollutants, radioactive materials, nanomaterials, and micro-plastics\". According to the update 4 of the boundaries are crossed: \"climate change, loss of biosphere integrity, land-system change, altered biogeochemical cycles (phosphorus and nitrogen)\". In 2019 they tried to develop a new version of the boundaries including in the boundary \"Introduction of novel entities\" ,  and even \nIn 2005  published a book titled:  in which he described 12 main problems that can be dangerous to sustainability:\nStrategies for reaching sustainability can generally be divided into three categories. Most governments and international organizations that aim to achieve sustainability employ all three approaches, though they may disagree on which deserves priority. The three approaches, embodied in the  formula, can be summarized as follows:\n Many believe that the best path to sustainability is reducing . This theory is represented most clearly in the idea of a , meaning an economy without growth. Methods in this category include, among others, the , promoting , and increasing . For example, according to the report \"Plastic and Climate\", the plastic could emit  emissions, as much as 15% of the earth's remaining carbon budget, by 2050 and over 50% by 2100, except the impacts on  The report says that for solving the problem,  will be essential\n Others think that the most effective means of achieving sustainability is , for example by improving access to  and education\n Still others hold that the most promising path to sustainability is new technology. This theory may be seen as a form of . One popular tactic in this category is transitioning to . Others methods to achieve sustainability, associated with this theory are , , .\nAlso legislation should not be a barrier to sustainability. Law literature has indicated legislative innovation might be needed.\nOrganizations whose main purpose is to maintain sustainability are generally defined as .

The desired result is a state of society where living conditions and resources are used to continue to meet human needs without undermining the integrity and stability of the natural system. Sustainable development can be defined as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\nWhile the modern concept of sustainable development is derived mostly from the 1987 , it is also rooted in earlier ideas about  and twentieth-century environmental concerns. As the concept developed, it has shifted its focus more towards the ,  and environmental protection for future generations. It has been suggested that \"the term 'sustainability' should be viewed as humanity's target goal of human-ecosystem equilibrium, while 'sustainable development' refers to the  and temporal processes that lead us to the end point of sustainability\". Modern economies are endeavoring to reconcile ambitious economic development and obligations of preserving  and , as the two are usually seen as of conflicting nature. Instead of holding climate change commitments and other sustainability measures as a remedy to economic development, turning and leveraging them into market opportunities will do greater good. The economic development brought by such organized principles and practices in an  is called Managed Sustainable Development (MSD).\nThe concept of sustainable development has been, and still is, subject to criticism, including the question of what is to be sustained in sustainable development. It has been argued that there is no such thing as a sustainable use of a , since any positive rate of exploitation will eventually lead to the exhaustion of earth's finite stock; this perspective renders the  as a whole unsustainable.   It has also been argued that the meaning of the concept has opportunistically been stretched from 'conservation management' to 'economic development', and that the Brundtland Report promoted nothing but a business as usual strategy for world development, with an ambiguous and insubstantial concept attached as a public relations slogan (). \nSustainability can be defined as the practice of maintaining world processes of productivity indefinitely\u2014natural or human-made\u2014by replacing resources used with resources of equal or greater value without degrading or endangering natural biotic systems. Sustainable development ties together concern for the  of  with the social, political, and economic challenges faced by humanity.  is the study of the concepts of sustainable development and environmental science. There is an additional focus on the present generations' responsibility to regenerate, maintain and improve planetary resources for use by future generations.\nSustainable development has its roots in ideas about  which were developed in Europe during the 17th and 18th centuries. In response to a growing awareness of the depletion of timber resources in England,  argued that \"sowing and planting of trees had to be regarded as a national duty of every landowner, in order to stop the destructive \" in his 1662 essay . In 1713 , a senior mining administrator in the service of Elector  published , a 400-page work on forestry. Building upon the ideas of Evelyn and French minister , von Carlowitz developed the concept of managing forests for . His work influenced others, including  and , eventually leading to the development of a science of forestry. This, in turn, influenced people like , first head of the , whose approach to forest management was driven by the idea of wise use of resources, and  whose  was influential in the development of the  in the 1960s.\nFollowing the publication of 's  in 1962, the developing environmental movement drew attention to the relationship between  and development and .  in his influential 1966 essay  identified the need for the economic system to fit itself to the ecological system with its limited pools of resources. Another milestone was the 1968 article by  that popularized the term \"\". One of the first uses of the term sustainable in the contemporary sense was by the  in 1972 in its classic report on the , written by a group of scientists led by  and  of the . Describing the desirable \"state of global equilibrium\", the authors wrote: \"We are searching for a model output that represents a world system that is sustainable without sudden and uncontrolled collapse and capable of satisfying the basic material requirements of all of its people.\" That year also saw the publication of the influential  book.\nFollowing the Club of Rome report, an MIT research group prepared ten days of hearings on \"\" (Roundtable Press, 1973) for the US Congress, the first hearings ever held on sustainable development. , David Dodson Gray, and Elizabeth Gray prepared the hearings under the Chairmanship of Congressman .\n\nIn 1980 the  published a world conservation strategy that included one of the first references to sustainable development as a global priority and introduced the term \"sustainable development\". Two years later, the   raised five principles of  by which human conduct affecting nature is to be guided and judged. In 1987 the   released the report , commonly called the Brundtland Report. The report included what is now one of the most widely recognised definitions of sustainable development.Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It contains within it two key concepts:\u00b7 The concept of 'needs', in particular, the essential needs of the world's poor, to which overriding priority should be given; and \u00b7 The idea of limitations imposed by the state of technology and social organization on the environment's ability to meet present and future needs.Since the Brundtland Report, the concept of sustainable development has developed beyond the initial intergenerational framework to focus more on the goal of \"socially  and environmentally \". In 1992, the  published the , which outlines the building of a just, sustainable, and peaceful global society in the 21st century. The action plan  for sustainable development identified information, integration, and participation as key building blocks to help countries achieve development that recognises these interdependent pillars. It emphasises that in sustainable development everyone is a user and provider of information. It stresses the need to change from old sector-centered ways of doing business to new approaches that involve cross-sectoral co-ordination and the integration of environmental and social concerns into all development processes. Furthermore, Agenda 21 emphasises that broad public participation in decision making is a fundamental prerequisite for achieving sustainable development.\nUnder the principles of the  the  identified principles and treaties on sustainable development, including ,  and . Broadly defined, sustainable development is a systems approach to growth and development and to manage natural, produced, and  for the welfare of their own and future generations. The term sustainable development as used by the United Nations incorporates both issues associated with  and broader issues of  such as education, public health, and standard of living.\nA 2013 study concluded that sustainability reporting should be reframed through the lens of four interconnected domains: ecology, economics, politics and culture.\n (ESD) is defined as education that encourages changes in , skills, values and attitudes to enable a more  and equitable . ESD aims to empower and equip current and future generations to meet the needs using a balanced and integrated approach to the ,  and  dimensions of sustainable development.\nThe concept of  was born from the need for  to address the growing and changing  environmental challenges facing the . In order to do this,  must change to provide the , skills, values and attitudes that empower  to contribute to sustainable development. At the same time,  must be strengthened in all agendas, programmes, and activities that promote sustainable development. Sustainable development must be integrated into  and education must be integrated into sustainable development. ESD promotes the integration of these critical sustainability issues in local and global contexts into the  to prepare  to understand and respond to the changing world. ESD aims to produce  that include core competencies such as critical and systematic , collaborative , and taking responsibility for the present and . Since traditional single-directional delivery of  is not sufficient to inspire learners to take action as , ESD entails rethinking the t, physical and virtual. The learning environment itself must adapt and apply a whole-institution approach to embed the philosophy of sustainable development. Building the capacity of  and policy support at international, regional, national and local levels helps drive changes in . Empowered youth and local communities interacting with education institutions become key actors in advancing sustainable development.\nThe launch of the UN Decade of  (2005-2014) started a global movement to reorient education to address the challenges of sustainable development. Building on the achievement of the Decade, stated in the Aichi-Nagoya Declaration on ESD,  endorsed the Global Action Programme on ESD (GAP) in the 37th session of its General Conference. Acknowledged by  Resolution A/RES/69/211 and launched at the UNESCO World Conference on ESD in 2014, the GAP aims to scale-up actions and good practices. UNESCO has a major role, along with its partners, in bringing about key achievements to ensure the principles of  are promoted through formal, non-formal and .\nInternational recognition of ESD as the key enabler for sustainable development is growing steadily. The role of ESD was recognized in three major UN summits on sustainable development: the 1992  (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro, ; the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg, ; and the 2012  (UNCSD) in Rio de Janeiro. Other key global agreements such as the  (Article 12) also recognize the importance of ESD. Today, ESD is arguably at the heart of the  and its 17  (SDGs) (United Nations, 2015). The SDGs recognize that all countries must stimulate action in the following key areas - people, , prosperity,  and  - in order to tackle the global challenges that are crucial for the survival of . ESD is explicitly mentioned in Target 4.7 of SDG4, which aims to ensure that all  acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development and is understood as an important means to achieve all the other 16 SDGs (UNESCO, 2017).\nSustainable development can be thought of in terms of three spheres, dimensions, domains or pillars, i.e. the environment, the economy and society. The three-sphere framework was initially proposed by the economist Rene Passet in 1979. It has also been worded as \"economic, environmental and social\" or \"ecology, economy and equity\". This has been expanded by some authors to include a fourth pillar of culture, institutions or governance, or alternatively reconfigured as four domains of the social - ecology, economics, politics and culture, thus bringing economics back inside the social, and treating ecology as the intersection of the social and the natural.\nThe  of human settlements is part of the relationship between humans and their natural, social and . Also termed , this broadens the focus of sustainable development to include the domain of human health. Fundamental human needs such as the availability and quality of air, water, food and shelter are also the ecological foundations for sustainable development; addressing public health risk through investments in  can be a powerful and transformative force for sustainable development which, in this sense, extends to all species.\nEnvironmental sustainability concerns the  and how it endures and remains diverse and productive. Since  are derived from the environment, the state of air, water, and the climate are of particular concern. The  outlines current knowledge about scientific, technical and socio-economic information concerning , and lists options for  and . Environmental sustainability requires society to design activities to meet human needs while preserving the life support systems of the planet. This, for example, entails using water sustainably, utilizing renewable energy, and sustainable material supplies (e.g. harvesting wood from forests at a rate that maintains the biomass and biodiversity).\nAn unsustainable situation occurs when  (the sum total of nature's resources) is used up faster than it can be replenished. Sustainability requires that human activity only uses nature's resources at a rate at which they can be replenished naturally. Inherently the concept of sustainable development is intertwined with the concept of carrying capacity. Theoretically, the long-term result of  is the inability to sustain human life.  Such degradation on a global scale should imply an increase in human death rate until population falls to what the degraded environment can support.  If the degradation continues beyond a certain  or critical threshold it would lead to eventual  for humanity.\nIntegral elements for a sustainable development are research and innovation activities. A telling example is the , which aims at defining and implementing a transformative agenda to greening the economy and the society as a whole so to achieve a truly sustainable development. Research and innovation in Europe is financially supported by the programme , which is also open to participation worldwide. A promising direction towards sustainable development is to design systems that are flexible and reversible.\nPollution of the public resources is really not a different action, it just is a reverse , in that instead of taking something out, something is put into the commons.  When the costs of polluting the commons are not calculated into the cost of the items consumed, then it becomes only natural to pollute, as the cost of pollution is external to the cost of the goods produced and the cost of cleaning the waste before it is discharged exceeds the cost of releasing the waste directly into the commons.  So, the only way to solve this problem is by protecting the ecology of the commons by making it, through taxes or fines, more costly to release the waste directly into the commons than would be the cost of cleaning the waste before discharge.\nSo, one can try to appeal to the ethics of the situation by doing the right thing as an individual, but in the absence of any direct consequences, the individual will tend to do what is best for the person and not what is best for the common good of the public.  Once again, this issue needs to be addressed.  Because, left unaddressed, the development of the commonly owned property will become impossible to achieve in a sustainable way.  So, this topic is central to the understanding of creating a sustainable situation from the management of the public resources that are used for personal use.\nSustainable agriculture consists of  methods of farming that allow the production of crops or livestock without damage to human or natural systems. It involves preventing adverse effects to soil, water, biodiversity, surrounding or downstream resources\u2014as well as to those working or living on the farm or in neighbouring areas. The concept of sustainable agriculture extends intergenerationally, passing on a conserved or improved natural resource, biotic, and economic base rather than one which has been depleted or polluted. Elements of sustainable agriculture include , , , , and . It involves agricultural methods that do not undermine the environment, smart farming technologies that enhance a quality environment for humans to thrive and reclaiming and transforming deserts into farmlands(Herman Daly, 2017).\nNumerous  systems exist, including , , , , Bird Friendly, and the Common Code for the Coffee Community (4C).\n\nIt has been suggested that because of rural  and , environmental resources should be treated as important economic assets, called . Economic development has traditionally required a growth in the . This model of unlimited personal and GDP growth may be over. Sustainable development may involve improvements in the quality of life for many but may necessitate a decrease in .\nAccording to ecological economist , ecological economics is defined by its focus on nature, justice, and time. Issues of ,  of environmental change,  of long-term outcomes, and sustainable development guide ecological economic analysis and valuation.\nAs early as the 1970s, the concept of sustainability was used to describe an  \"in equilibrium with basic ecological support systems\". Scientists in many fields have highlighted , and economists have presented alternatives, for example a '', to address concerns over the impacts of expanding human development on the planet. In 1987 the economist Edward Barbier published the study , where he recognised that goals of environmental conservation and economic development are not conflicting and can be reinforcing each other.\nA  study from 1999 concluded that based on the theory of genuine savings, policymakers have many possible interventions to increase sustainability, in  or purely environmental. Several studies have noted that efficient policies for renewable energy and pollution are compatible with increasing human welfare, eventually reaching a golden-rule steady state.\nThe study, , found three pillars of sustainable development, interlinkage, , and .\nBut  points out that the World Bank has twisted the notion of sustainable development to prove that economic development need not be deterred in the interest of preserving the ecosystem. He writes: \"From this angle, 'sustainable development' looks like a cover-up operation. ... The thing that is meant to be sustained is really 'development', not the tolerance capacity of the ecosystem or of human societies.\"\nThe World Bank, a leading producer of environmental knowledge, continues to advocate the win-win prospects for economic growth and ecological stability even as its economists express their doubts. , an economist for the Bank from 1988 to 1994, writes:\nWhen authors of  '92 [the highly influential 1992  that featured the environment] were drafting the report, they called me asking for examples of \"win-win\" strategies in my work. What could I say? None exists in that pure form; there are trade-offs, not \"win-wins.\" But they want to see a world of \"win-wins\" based on articles of faith, not fact. I wanted to contribute because s are important in the Bank, [because] task managers read [them] to find philosophical justification for their latest round of projects. But they did not want to hear about how things really are, or what I find in my work...A meta review in 2002 looked at environmental and economic valuations and found a lack of \"sustainability policies\". A study in 2004 asked if we consume too much. A study concluded in 2007 that knowledge, manufactured and human capital (health and education) has not compensated for the degradation of natural capital in many parts of the world. It has been suggested that intergenerational equity can be incorporated into a sustainable development and decision making, as has become common in economic valuations of climate economics. A meta review in 2009 identified conditions for a strong case to act on , and called for more work to fully account of the relevant economics and how it affects human welfare. According to   \"the improvement of environment quality depends on the  and the existence of legitimate and protected  rights\". They enable the effective practice of personal responsibility and the development of mechanisms to protect the environment. The State can in this context \"create conditions which encourage the people to save the environment\".\nMisum, Mistra Center for Sustainable Markets, based at , aims to provide policy research and advice to Swedish and international actors on Sustainable Markets. Misum is a cross-disciplinary and multi-stakeholder knowledge center dedicated to sustainability and sustainable markets and contains three research platforms: Sustainability in Financial Markets (Mistra Financial Systems), Sustainability in Production and Consumption and Sustainable Socio-Economic Development.\nThe total environment includes not just the biosphere of earth, air, and water, but also human interactions with these things, with nature, and what humans have created as their surroundings.\nAs countries around the world continue to advance economically, they put a strain on the ability of the natural environment to absorb the high level of pollutants that are created as a part of this economic growth. Therefore, solutions need to be found so that the economies of the world can continue to grow, but not at the expense of the public good.  In the world of economics the amount of environmental quality must be considered as limited in supply and therefore is treated as a scarce resource. This is a resource to be protected. One common way to analyze possible outcomes of policy decisions on the scarce resource is to do a cost-benefit analysis. This type of analysis contrasts different options of resource allocation and, based on an evaluation of the expected courses of action and the consequences of these actions, the optimal way to do so in the light of different policy goals can be elicited.\nBenefit-cost analysis basically can look at several ways of solving a problem and then assigning the best route for a solution, based on the set of consequences that would result from the further development of the individual courses of action, and then choosing the course of action that results in the least amount of damage to the expected outcome for the environmental quality that remains after that development or process takes place. Further complicating this analysis are the interrelationships of the various parts of the environment that might be impacted by the chosen course of action.  Sometimes it is almost impossible to predict the various outcomes of a course of action, due to the unexpected consequences and the amount of unknowns that are not accounted for in the benefit-cost analysis.\nSustainable energy is clean and can be used over a long period of time. Unlike fossil fuels and biofuels that provide the bulk of the worlds energy,  sources like hydroelectric, solar and wind energy produce far less pollution.  is commonly used on public parking meters, street lights and the roof of buildings.  has expanded quickly, its share of worldwide electricity usage at the end of 2014 was 3.1%. Most of California's fossil fuel infrastructures are sited in or near low-income communities, and have traditionally suffered the most from California's fossil fuel energy system.  These communities are historically left out during the decision-making process, and often end up with dirty power plants and other dirty energy projects that poison the air and harm the area. These toxicants are major contributors to health problems in the communities. As renewable energy becomes more common, fossil fuel infrastructures are replaced by renewables and we may begin to see a , providing better social equity to these communities.\nOverall, and in the long run, sustainable development in the field of energy is also deemed to contribute to economic sustainability and national security of communities, thus being increasingly encouraged through investment policies.\nOne of the core concepts in sustainable development is that technology can be used to assist people to meet their developmental needs. Technology to meet these sustainable development needs is often referred to as , which is an ideological movement (and its manifestations) originally articulated as  by the economist  in his influential work  and now covers a wide range of technologies. Both Schumacher and many modern-day proponents of appropriate technology also emphasise the technology as people-centered. Today appropriate technology is often developed using  principles, which have led to  (OSAT) and thus many of the plans of the technology can be freely found on the . OSAT has been proposed as a new model of enabling  for sustainable development.\nTransportation is a large contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. It is said that one-third of all gases produced are due to transportation. Motorized transport also releases exhaust fumes that contain particulate matter which is hazardous to human health and a contributor to climate change.\nSustainable transport has many social and economic benefits that can accelerate local sustainable development. According to a series of reports by the , sustainable transport can help create jobs, improve commuter safety through investment in bicycle lanes and pedestrian pathways, make access to employment and social opportunities more affordable and efficient. It also offers a practical opportunity to save people's time and household income as well as government budgets, making investment in sustainable transport a 'win-win' opportunity.\nSome Western countries are making transportation more sustainable in both long-term and short-term implementations. An example is the modification in available transportation in . The city has implemented extensive methods of public transportation, cycling, and walking, along with large areas where cars are not allowed.\nSince many Western countries are highly automobile-oriented, the main transit that people use is personal vehicles. About 80% of their travel involves cars. Therefore, California, is one of the highest  emitters in the United States. The federal government has to come up with some plans to reduce the total number of vehicle trips in order to lower greenhouse gases emission. Such as:\nOther states and nations have built efforts to  in  into   policies.\nThe most broadly accepted criterion for corporate sustainability constitutes a firm's efficient use of natural capital.  This  is usually calculated as the economic value added by a firm in relation to its aggregated ecological impact.  This idea has been popularised by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development () under the following definition: \"Eco-efficiency is achieved by the delivery of competitively priced goods and services that satisfy human needs and bring quality of life, while progressively reducing ecological impacts and  throughout the life-cycle to a level at least in line with the earth's carrying capacity\" (DeSimone and Popoff, 1997: 47).\nSimilar to the eco-efficiency concept but so far less explored is the second criterion for corporate sustainability. Socio-efficiency describes the relation between a firm's value added and its social impact. Whereas, it can be assumed that most corporate impacts on the environment are negative (apart from rare exceptions such as the planting of trees) this is not true for social impacts. These can be either positive (e.g. corporate giving, creation of employment) or negative (e.g. work accidents, mobbing of employees, human rights abuses). Depending on the type of impact socio-efficiency thus either tries to minimise negative social impacts (i.e. accidents per value added) or maximise positive social impacts (i.e. donations per value added) in relation to the value added.\nBoth eco-efficiency and socio-efficiency are concerned primarily with increasing economic sustainability. In this process they instrumentalise both natural and social capital aiming to benefit from win-win situations. However, as Dyllick and Hockerts point out the business case alone will not be sufficient to realise sustainable development. They point towards eco-effectiveness, socio-effectiveness, sufficiency, and eco-equity as four criteria that need to be met if sustainable development is to be reached.\nCASI Global, New York \"CSR & Sustainability together lead to sustainable development. CSR as in corporate social responsibility is not what you do with your profits, but is the way you make profits. This means CSR is a part of every department of the company value chain and not a part of HR / independent department. Sustainability as in effects towards Human resources, Environment and Ecology has to be measured within each department of the company.\" \nAt the present time, sustainable development can reduce . Sustainable development reduces  through financial (among other things, a balanced budget), environmental (living conditions), and social (including equality of income) means.\nIn sustainable architecture the recent movements of  and  promote a sustainable approach towards , that appreciates and develops ,  and . This in contrast to  and  architecture, as well as opposing to solitary  and , with long commuting distances and large ecological footprints. Both trends started in the 1980s. (Sustainable architecture is predominantly relevant to the economics domain while architectural landscaping pertains more to the ecological domain.)\nA study concluded that social indicators and, therefore, sustainable development indicators, are scientific constructs whose principal objective is to inform public policy-making. The  has similarly developed a political policy framework, linked to a sustainability index for establishing measurable entities and metrics. The framework consists of six core areas:\nThe  Cities Programme has defined sustainable political development in a way that broadens the usual definition beyond states and governance. The political is defined as the domain of practices and meanings associated with basic issues of social power as they pertain to the organisation, authorisation, legitimation and regulation of a social life held in common. This definition is in accord with the view that political change is important for responding to economic, ecological and cultural challenges. It also means that the politics of economic change can be addressed. They have listed seven subdomains of the domain of politics:\nThis accords with the Brundtland Commission emphasis on development that is guided by human rights principles (see above).\nWorking with a different emphasis, some researchers and institutions have pointed out that a fourth dimension should be added to the dimensions of sustainable development, since the triple-bottom-line dimensions of economic, environmental and social do not seem to be enough to reflect the complexity of contemporary society. In this context, the  and the  (UCLG)  Executive Bureau lead the preparation of the policy statement \"Culture: Fourth Pillar of Sustainable Development\", passed on 17 November 2010, in the framework of the World Summit of Local and Regional Leaders\u00a0\u2013 3rd World Congress of UCLG, held in Mexico City. This document inaugurates a new perspective and points to the relation between culture and sustainable development through a dual approach: developing a solid  and advocating a cultural dimension in all public policies. The  approach distinguishes the four domains of economic, ecological, political and cultural sustainability.\nOther organizations have also supported the idea of a fourth domain of sustainable development. The Network of Excellence \"Sustainable Development in a Diverse World\", sponsored by the , integrates multidisciplinary capacities and interprets  as a key element of a new strategy for sustainable development. The Fourth Pillar of Sustainable Development Theory has been referenced by executive director of IMI Institute at  Vito Di Bari in his manifesto of art and architectural movement , whose name was inspired by the 1987 ' report . The  approach used by Metropolis defines the (fourth) cultural domain as practices, discourses, and material expressions, which, over time, express continuities and discontinuities of social meaning.\nRecently, human-centered design and cultural collaboration have been popular frameworks for sustainable development in marginalized communities. These frameworks involve open dialogue which entails sharing, debating, and discussing, as well as holistic evaluation of the site of development. Especially when working on sustainable development in marginalized communities, cultural emphasis is a crucial factor in project decisions, since it largely affects aspects of their lives and traditions. Collaborators utilize  in co-designing. This allows for them to understand each other's thought process and their comprehension of the sustainable projects. By using the method of co-design, the beneficiaries' holistic needs are being considered. Final decisions and implementations are made with respect to sociocultural and ecological factors.\nThe user-oriented framework relies heavily on user participation and user feedback in the planning process. Users are able to provide new perspective and ideas, which can be considered in a new round of improvements and changes. It is said that increased user participation in the design process can garner a more comprehensive understanding of the design issues, due to more contextual and emotional transparency between researcher and participant. A key element of  is applied ethnography, which was a research method adopted from . This research method requires researchers to be fully immersed in the observation so that implicit details are also recorded.\nMany communities express environmental concerns, so  is often conducted when assessing the sustainability of a product or prototype. The assessment is done in stages with meticulous cycles of planning, design, implementation, and evaluation. The decision to choose materials is heavily weighted on its longevity, renewability, and efficiency. These factors ensure that researchers are conscious of community values that align with positive environmental, social, and economic impacts.\nThe  (UNCSD; also known as Rio 2012) was the third international conference on sustainable development,  which aimed at reconciling the economic and environmental goals of the global community. An outcome of this conference was the development of the  that aim to promote sustainable progress and eliminate inequalities around the world. However, few nations met the 's definition of sustainable development criteria established in 2006. Although some nations are more developed than others, all nations are constantly developing because each nation struggles with perpetuating disparities, inequalities and unequal access to fundamental rights and freedoms.\nIn 2007 a report for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency stated: \"While much discussion and effort has gone into sustainability indicators, none of the resulting systems clearly tells us whether our society is sustainable. At best, they can tell us that we are heading in the wrong direction, or that our current activities are not sustainable. More often, they simply draw our attention to the existence of problems, doing little to tell us the origin of those problems and nothing to tell us how to solve them.\" Nevertheless, a majority of authors assume that a set of well defined and harmonised indicators is the only way to make sustainability tangible. Those indicators are expected to be identified and adjusted through empirical observations (trial and error).\nThe most common critiques are related to issues like data quality, comparability, objective function and the necessary resources. However a more general criticism is coming from the project management community: How can a sustainable development be achieved at global level if we cannot monitor it in any single project?\nThe Cuban-born researcher and entrepreneur Sonia Bueno suggests an alternative approach that is based upon the integral, long-term cost-benefit relationship as a measure and monitoring tool for the sustainability of every project, activity or enterprise. Furthermore, this concept aims to be a practical guideline towards sustainable development following the principle of conservation and increment of value rather than restricting the consumption of resources.\nReasonable qualifications of sustainability are seen U.S. Green Building Council's (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). This design incorporates some ecological, economic, and social elements. The goals presented by LEED design goals are sustainable sites, water efficiency, energy consumption and atmospheric emission reduction, material and resources efficiency, and indoor environmental quality. Although amount of structures for sustainability development is many, these qualification has become a standard for sustainable building.\nRecent research efforts created also the  to benchmark the performance of cities across aspects that are related to energy, water and environment systems. The  Index consists of 7 dimensions, 35 indicators, and close to 20 sub-indicators. It is currently applied to 58 cities.\nThe sustainable development debate is based on the assumption that societies need to manage three types of capital (economic, social, and natural), which may be non-substitutable and whose consumption might be irreversible. Leading  and  , for example, points to the fact that  can not necessarily be substituted by economic capital. While it is possible that we can find ways to replace some natural resources, it is much more unlikely that they will ever be able to replace eco-system services, such as the protection provided by the ozone layer, or the climate stabilizing function of the Amazonian forest. In fact natural capital, social capital and economic capital are often complementarities. A further obstacle to substitutability lies also in the multi-functionality of many natural resources. Forests, for example, not only provide the raw material for paper (which can be substituted quite easily), but they also maintain biodiversity, regulate water flow, and absorb CO2.\nAnother problem of natural and social capital deterioration lies in their partial irreversibility. The , for example, is often definitive. The same can be true for cultural diversity. For example, with globalisation advancing quickly the number of indigenous languages is dropping at alarming rates.  Moreover, the depletion of natural and social capital may have non-linear consequences. Consumption of natural and social capital may have no observable impact until a certain threshold is reached. A lake can, for example, absorb nutrients for a long time while actually increasing its productivity. However, once a certain level of algae is reached lack of oxygen causes the lake's ecosystem to break down suddenly.\nIf the degradation of natural and social capital has such important consequence the question arises why action is not taken more systematically to alleviate it. Cohen and Winn point to four types of market failure as possible explanations: First, while the benefits of natural or social capital depletion can usually be privatised, the costs are often externalised (i.e. they are borne not by the party responsible but by society in general). Second, natural capital is often undervalued by society since we are not fully aware of the real cost of the depletion of natural capital. Information asymmetry is a third reason\u2014often the link between cause and effect is obscured, making it difficult for actors to make informed choices. Cohen and Winn close with the realization that contrary to economic theory many firms are not perfect optimisers. They postulate that firms often do not optimise resource allocation because they are caught in a \"business as usual\" mentality.\n\nEducation must be revisited in light of a renewed vision of sustainable human and social development that is both equitable and viable. This vision of sustainability must take into consideration the social, environmental and economic dimensions of human development and the various ways in which these relate to education: 'An empowering education is one that builds the human resources we need to be productive, to continue to learn, to solve problems, to be creative, and to live together and with nature in peace and harmony. When nations ensure that such an education is accessible to all throughout their lives, a quiet revolution is set in motion: education becomes the engine of sustainable development and the key to a better world.'\nIt has been argued that since the 1960s, the concept of sustainable development has changed from \"conservation management\" to \"economic development\", whereby the original meaning of the concept has been stretched somewhat.\nIn the 1960s, the international community realised that many African countries needed national plans to safeguard wildlife habitats, and that rural areas had to confront the limits imposed by soil, climate and water availability. This was a strategy of conservation management. In the 1970s, however, the focus shifted to the broader issues of the provisioning of basic human needs, community participation as well as appropriate technology use throughout the developing countries (and not just in Africa). This was a strategy of economic development, and the strategy was carried even further by the 's report on  when the issues went from regional to international in scope and application. In effect, the conservationists were crowded out and superseded by the developers.\nBut shifting the focus of sustainable development from conservation to development has had the imperceptible effect of stretching the original forest management term of  from the use of renewable resources only (like forestry), to now also accounting for the use of non-renewable resources (like ). This stretching of the term has been questioned. Thus, environmental economist Kerry Turner has argued that literally, there can be no such thing as overall \"sustainable development\" in an industrialised  that remains heavily dependent on the extraction of earth's finite stock of exhaustible mineral resources: \"It makes no sense to talk about the sustainable use of a non-renewable resource (even with substantial  effort and reduction in use rates). Any positive rate of exploitation will eventually lead to exhaustion of the finite stock.\"\nIn effect, it has been argued that the industrial revolution as a whole is unsustainable.   \nOne critic has argued that the  promoted nothing but a business as usual strategy for world development, with the ambiguous and insubstantial concept of \"sustainable development\" attached as a public relations slogan: The report on  was largely the result of a political bargaining process involving many special interest groups, all put together to create a common appeal of political acceptability across borders. After World War II, the notion of \"development\" had been established in the West to imply the projection of the American model of society onto the rest of the world. In the 1970s and 1980s, this notion was broadened somewhat to also imply human rights, basic human needs and finally, ecological issues. The emphasis of the report was on helping poor nations out of poverty and meeting the basic needs of their growing populations\u2014as usual. This issue demanded more economic growth, also in the rich countries, who would then import more goods from the poor countries to help them out\u2014as usual. When the discussion switched to , the obvious dilemma was left aside by calling for economic growth with improved resource efficiency, or what was termed \"a change in the  of growth\". However, most countries in the West had experienced such improved resource efficiency since the early-20th century already and as usual; only, this improvement had been more than offset by continuing industrial expansion, to the effect that world resource consumption was now higher than ever before\u2014and these two historical trends were completely ignored in the report. Taken together, the policy of perpetual economic growth for the entire planet remained virtually intact. Since the publication of the report, the ambiguous and insubstantial slogan of \"sustainable development\" has marched on worldwide.\n\u00a0This article incorporates text from a  work.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability_marketing_myopia", "title": "SustainabilitymarketingmyopiaWikipedia", "body": " is a term used in  referring to a distortion stemming from the overlooking of socio-environmental attributes of a  or service at the expenses of customer benefits and values. Sustainability marketing is oriented towards the whole community, its social goals and the protection of the . It requires the engagement of national and , organisations and population as well as the necessary capital (human, financial, infrastructural, etc.). The idea of sustainability marketing myopia is rooted into conventional , as well as  myopia.\nThe marketing myopia theory was originally proposed in 1960 by American economist . According to Levitt marketers should not overlook the importance of company potential and product attributes at the expenses of market needs; catering for market needs should receive first priority.\nA company, besides being technically sound and product oriented, also needs to be customer oriented in order to successfully cater for a market. Knowledge of customer needs and of innovations that can be implemented to maintain customer interest, as well as of how to adapt to the changing business market is crucial.\nMarketing myopia has been highly influential in the formation of modern marketing theory, and was heeded by marketers to such an extent that some authors now speak of a \u201cnew marketing myopia\u201d stemming from too narrow a focus on customer to the exclusion of other stakeholders.\nGreen marketing is the marketing of products that are presumed to be environmentally safe. In order to be successful, green marketing must fulfill two objectives: improved environmental quality and customer satisfaction. Misjudging either or overemphasizing the former at the expense of the latter can be defined as green marketing myopia.\nThe marketing discipline has long argued that innovation must consider an intimate understanding of the customer and a close look at green marketing practices over time reveals that green products must be positioned on a consumer value sought by targeted consumers.\nAs such, successful green products are able to appeal to mainstream consumers or lucrative market niches and frequently command price premiums by offering \u201cnon-green\u201d consumer value (such as convenience and performance). When consumers are convinced of the desirable \u201cnon-green\u201d benefits of environmental products, they are more inclined to adopt them.\nAside from offering environmental benefits that do not meet consumer preferences, green marketing myopia can also occur when green products fail to provide credible, substantive environmental benefits.\nSustainability marketing aims at marketing sustainable products and services which \u201csatisfy customer needs and significantly improve the social and environmental performance along the whole life cycle\u201d, while increasing customer value and achieving the company's objectives. In turns, sustainability marketing myopia is an exaggerated focus on the socio-ecological attributes of the product over the core consumer values, a distortion of the marketing process which is likely to lead to the product failing on the market or remaining confined in a small alternative niche.\nJust as an excessive focus on product attributes generates marketing myopia, and just as a single-minded focus on customers results in \u201cnew marketing myopia\u201d, in both green and sustainability marketing  an unbalanced strategy neglecting one aspect (namely, product attributes) is detrimental to the effectiveness of the marketing process.\nHowever, it is important to note that sustainability marketing myopia differs from green marketing myopia in that the former follows a broader approach to the marketing myopia issue, taking into account the social attributes of a product, as well as the environmental ones. At the same time, sustainability marketing myopia encompasses sustainable services and product-related services, not products alone.\nGenerally, sustainability marketing myopia can be avoided in two ways:\n et al. provides examples of successful marketing communications based on the highlighting of inherent consumer\u2019s values of the socio-ecological features of products, and on bundling:\nBesides striking a right balance of focus between product attributes and consumers\u2019 benefits, sustainability marketers should also avoid employing  about the socio-environmental benefits of their products. This particular form of marketing myopia is best avoided by building an image of credibility for the  through effective sustainability communication, so that consumers can easily associate their products with sound socio-environmental performances.\nAccording to the authors of Natural Capitalism \u201cproduct dematerialisation\u201d is one of the prerequisites for a more sustainable business model. In order to become more sustainable the future economy will transform from \u201csale of goods\u201d to the \u201csale of services\u201d. Belz and Peattie also stress the role of services as a part of sustainable solution, talking of product-related, use-oriented and result-oriented services. Product-related services are offered additionally and they optimize the product use, e.g. automobile companies offering courses on a more ecological and safe driving manner.  In the case of use-oriented services, a service and not a product is sold to the consumer e.g. car-sharing. As for result-oriented services, consumers neither own nor operate a product e. g. public transportation, with consumers only enjoying the outcome of the product, the transportation services.\n\u201cProduct dematerialisation\u201d is, too, at risk of incurring in sustainability marketing myopia. In 1999 Electrolux piloted an use-oriented sustainable \u201cpay-per-wash\u201d service in Sweden, failing to succeed because of a myopic marketing approach. New energy and water efficient washing machines were distributed by Electrolux among consumers. Electrolux supplied customers with maintenance services through a central database via the Internet and took care of the disposal and upgrading of the machines. Consumers did not pay for the machines themselves; they were only charged with a small installation fee at the beginning, and through a pay-per-wash charging system (10 Swedish kronor (about 1 $) per wash). However, an excessive emphasis on the green component in the marketing of this service, achieved at the expenses of other consumer benefits and values, failed to convince the consumers. According to A. Ottmann et al. not only environmental but also other inherent consumer values should have been better marketed by Electrolux: convenience of pay-per-wash, including easy trade-ins for upgrades, free service and saved money of a new washing machine.  In addition, the sustainable service might have been successful if pay-per-wash convenience would have been bundled with more desirable features.\nThe initial idea of introducing the  coffee certification was to abolish poverty among coffee farmers and their workers by supporting better working conditions and enabling growers to compete in the global market. For this reason, Fairtrade coffee started to be acquired directly from the farmers for a higher price than standard coffee. A minimum price for coffee is guaranteed and if the market prices outreach the minimum, growers receive a premium. In compliance with rising consumers\u00b4 demand for environmentally and social beneficial products the Fairtrade certification appears to be an evident indicator. Products marked with the label have to meet standards ensuring that strict social and environmental measures are taken.\nThe first generation of Fairtrade coffee suffered from sustainability marketing myopia.  First, due to the exaggerated focus on the socio-ecological aspects the quality and the taste of the coffee were put into the background. Most coffee farmers used to sell their coffee to both Fairtrade and open markets. As the price in the open market is entirely defined by quality, farmers sold their better quality beans in that market and then squandered their poorer beans into the Fairtrade market, where they were nonetheless ensured a good price. Furthermore, the certainty that Fairtrade buyers would mix supplies together discouraged farmers to improve the quality of their own beans without having any financial reward for that.\nFurthermore, Fairtrade coffee failed to guarantee the social and environmental benefits to the consumer as covenant. Moreover, Fairtrade has been accused of misleading consumers about its ability to monitor production practices, with particular regards to salary conditions of temporary workers.\nThe first generation Fairtrade coffee with a worse quality and bitter taste failed to satisfy all customers\u00b4 needs and supposedly to improve the social performance along the whole life cycle of the product.\nAs well as Electrolux and Fairtrade coffee suppliers, the producers of green buildings in Western Europe suffered from sustainability marketing myopia in the experimental stages of energy-efficient houses. Companies focussed on the energy-efficient attributes of the houses at the expenses of cost-effectiveness and affordability, marketing their products on the basis of , ecology and energy-savings. In addition, further inherent consumer values as comfort and design were also ignored at these early stages.\nNevertheless, since the beginning of the twenty-first century marketers from construction companies have improved their strategies. Successful sustainability marketing concepts have been progressively adopted, including motive alliances  and the use of a new marketing mix based on so-called 4 Cs: consumer solution, consumer cost, communication and convenience. This new approach has fostered a rise in the market share of energy-efficient houses.\n81F\u00fcnf Holzbau is an example of such a company applying successful marketing strategies. It is a fast expanding German company which focuses on energy-efficient wooden houses. Conventional criteria as high-quality levels and comfort are aligned with sustainable components in the company : healthy indoor environment created by using natural woods, energy savings and security from future oil price rises are among the arguments used. Their interactive online toolkit \u201c\u201d allows to easily calculate the life cycle cost and savings compared to conventional houses and acts, therefore, as a credibility tool. In order to offer the broadest choice in terms of consumer solutions, different house models are provided to various customer target groups according to their environmental consciousness and affordability.\n"},

The term is sometimes used in the context of  emissions that are produced from human activity since the start of the  but also applies broadly to all major human impacts on the environment. Many of the actions taken by humans that contribute to a heated environment stem from the burning of fossil fuel from a variety of sources, such as: electricity, cars, planes, space heating, manufacturing, or the destruction of forests.\n described the level of human population on the planet as a multiplier of all other environmental problems. In 2013, he described humanity as \"a plague on the Earth\" that needs to be controlled by limiting population growth.\nSome , such as the radical thinker and polemicist , see human overpopulation as a threat to the entire . In 2017, over 15,000 scientists around the world issued a second  which asserted that rapid human population growth is the \"primary driver behind many ecological and even societal threats.\"\nOverconsumption is a situation where resource use has outpaced the sustainable capacity of the ecosystem. It can be measured by the , a resource accounting approach which compares human demand on ecosystems with the amount of planet matter ecosystems can renew. Estimates indicate that humanity's current demand is 70% higher than the regeneration rate of all of the planet's ecosystems combined. A prolonged pattern of overconsumption leads to environmental degradation and the eventual loss of resource bases.\nHumanity's overall impact on the planet is affected by many factors, not just the raw number of people. Their lifestyle (including overall affluence and resource utilization) and the pollution they generate (including ) are equally important. In 2008,  stated that the inhabitants of the developed nations of the world consume resources like oil and metals at a rate almost 32 times greater than those of the developing world, who make up the majority of the human population.\nThe effects of overpopulation are compounded by . According to , speaking in 2017:\nRich western countries are now siphoning up the planet\u2019s resources and destroying its ecosystems at an unprecedented rate. We want to build highways across the Serengeti to get more rare earth minerals for our cellphones. We grab all the fish from the sea, wreck the coral reefs and put carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. We have triggered a major extinction event [...] A world population of around a billion would have an overall pro-life effect. This could be supported for many millennia and sustain many more human lives in the long term compared with our current uncontrolled growth and prospect of sudden collapse [...] If everyone consumed resources at the US level \u2013 which is what the world aspires to \u2013 you will need another four or five Earths. We are wrecking our planet\u2019s .Human civilization has caused the loss of 83% of  mammals and half of plants.  The world's chickens are triple the weight of all the wild birds, while domesticated cattle and pigs outweigh all wild mammals by 14 to 1. Global meat consumption is projected to more than double by 2050, perhaps as much as 76%, as the global population rises to more than 9 billion, which will be a significant driver of further  and increased  emissions.\nThe environmental impact of agriculture varies based on the wide variety of agricultural practices employed around the world. Ultimately, the environmental impact depends on the production practices of the system used by farmers. The connection between emissions into the environment and the farming system is indirect, as it also depends on other climate variables such as rainfall and temperature.\nThere are two types of indicators of environmental impact: \"means-based\", which is based on the farmer's production methods, and \"effect-based\", which is the impact that farming methods have on the farming system or on emissions to the environment. An example of a means-based indicator would be the quality of groundwater that is affected by the amount of  to the . An indicator reflecting the loss of nitrate to groundwater would be effect-based.\nThe environmental impact of agriculture involves a variety of factors from the soil, to water, the air, animal and soil diversity, plants, and the food itself. Some of the environmental issues that are related to agriculture are , , genetic engineering, irrigation problems, pollutants, , and .\nThe environmental impact of fishing can be divided into issues that involve the availability of fish to be caught, such as , , and ; and issues that involve the impact of fishing on other elements of the environment, such as  and destruction of habitat such as .\nThese conservation issues are part of , and are addressed in  programs. There is a growing gap between how many fish are available to be caught and humanity's desire to catch them, a problem that gets worse as the  grows.\nSimilar to other , there can be conflict between the  who depend on fishing for their livelihoods and fishery scientists who realize that if future fish populations are to be  then some fisheries must reduce or even close.\nThe journal  published a four-year study in November 2006, which predicted that, at prevailing trends, the world would run out of wild-caught  in 2048. The scientists stated that the decline was a result of ,  and other environmental factors that were reducing the population of fisheries at the same time as their ecosystems were being degraded. Yet again the analysis has met criticism as being fundamentally flawed, and many fishery management officials, industry representatives and scientists challenge the findings, although the debate continues. Many countries, such as , the ,  and , and international management bodies have taken steps to appropriately manage marine resources.\nThe UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) released their biennial State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture in 2018 noting that capture fishery production has remained constant for the last two decades but unsustainable overfishing has increased to 33% of the world's fisheries.  They also noted that aquaculture, the production of farmed fish, has increased from 120 million tonnes per year in 1990 to over 170 million tonnes in 2018.\nThe environmental impact of irrigation includes the changes in quantity and quality of  and  as a result of  and the ensuing effects on natural and social conditions at the tail-end and downstream of the irrigation scheme.\nThe impacts stem from the changed  owing to the installation and operation of the scheme.\nAn irrigation scheme often draws water from the river and distributes it over the irrigated area. As a hydrological result it is found that:\nThese may be called direct effects.\nEffects on soil and  are indirect and complex, and subsequent impacts on natural,  and  conditions are intricate.  In some, but not all instances,  and  can result.  However, irrigation can also be used, together with soil drainage, to overcome soil salinization by leaching excess salts from the vicinity of the root zone.\nIrrigation can also be done extracting groundwater by . As a hydrological result it is found that the level of the water descends. The effects may be , land/soil , and, along the coast, .\nIrrigation projects can have large benefits, but the negative side effects are often overlooked.\nAgricultural irrigation technologies such as high powered water pumps, dams, and pipelines are responsible for the large-scale depletion of fresh water resources such as aquifers, lakes, and rivers.  As a result of this massive diversion of freshwater, lakes, rivers, and creeks are running dry, severely altering or stressing surrounding ecosystems, and contributing to the extinction of many aquatic species.\nLal and Stewart estimated global loss of agricultural land by degradation and abandonment at 12 million hectares per year.    In contrast, according to Scherr, GLASOD (Global Assessment of Human-Induced Soil Degradation, under the UN Environment Programme) estimated that 6 million hectares of agricultural land per year had been lost to soil degradation since the mid-1940s, and she noted that this magnitude is similar to earlier estimates by Dudal and by Rozanov et al.  Such losses are attributable not only to , but also to salinization, loss of nutrients and organic matter, acidification, compaction, water logging and subsidence.  Human-induced land degradation tends to be particularly serious in dry regions. Focusing on soil properties, Oldeman estimated that about 19 million square kilometers of global land area had been degraded; Dregne and Chou, who included degradation of vegetation cover as well as soil, estimated about 36 million square kilometers degraded in the world's dry regions. Despite estimated losses of agricultural land, the amount of arable land used in crop production globally increased by about 9% from 1961 to 2012, and is estimated to have been 1.396 billion hectares in 2012.\nGlobal average soil erosion rates are thought to be high, and erosion rates on conventional cropland generally exceed estimates of soil production rates, usually by more than an order of magnitude. In the US, sampling for erosion estimates by the US NRCS (Natural Resources Conservation Service) is statistically based, and estimation uses the Universal Soil Loss Equation and Wind Erosion Equation. For 2010, annual average soil loss by sheet, rill and wind erosion on non-federal US land was estimated to be 10.7 t/ha on cropland and 1.9 t/ha on pasture land; the average soil erosion rate on US cropland had been reduced by about 34% since 1982. No-till and low-till practices have become increasingly common on North American cropland used for production of grains such as wheat and barley. On uncultivated cropland, the recent average total soil loss has been 2.2 t/ha per year.  In comparison with agriculture using conventional cultivation, it has been suggested that, because no-till agriculture produces erosion rates much closer to soil production rates, it could provide a foundation for sustainable agriculture.\n is a process in which the value of the  is affected by a combination of human-induced processes acting upon the land.

This is considered to be an important topic of the  due to the implications land degradation has upon , the environment, and its effects on . It is estimated that up to 40% of the world's agricultural land is seriously degraded.\n\nEnvironmental impacts associated with meat production include use of fossil energy, water and land resources, greenhouse gas emissions, and in some instances, rainforest clearing, water pollution and species endangerment, among other adverse effects. Steinfeld et al. of the FAO estimated that 18% of global anthropogenic GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions (estimated as 100-year carbon dioxide equivalents) are associated in some way with livestock production. FAO data indicate that meat accounted for 26% of global livestock product tonnage in 2011.\nGlobally, enteric fermentation (mostly in ruminant livestock) accounts for about 27% of anthropogenic ,  Despite methane's 100-year global warming potential, recently estimated at 28 without and 34 with climate carbon feedbacks, methane emission is currently contributing relatively little to global warming. Although reduction of methane emissions would have a rapid effect on warming, the expected effect would be small. Other anthropogenic GHG emissions associated with livestock production include carbon dioxide from fossil fuel consumption (mostly for production, harvesting and transport of feed), and nitrous oxide emissions associated with use of nitrogenous fertilizers, growing of nitrogen-fixing legume vegetation and manure management. Management practices that can mitigate GHG emissions from production of livestock and feed have been identified.\nConsiderable water use is associated with meat production, mostly because of water used in production of vegetation that provides feed.  There are several published estimates of water use associated with livestock and meat production, but the amount of water use assignable to such production is seldom estimated.  For example, \u201cgreen water\u201d use is evapotranspirational use of soil water that has been provided directly by precipitation; and \u201cgreen water\u201d has been estimated to account for 94% of global beef cattle production's \u201c\u201d, and on rangeland, as much as 99.5% of the water use associated with beef production is \u201cgreen water\u201d.\nImpairment of water quality by manure and other substances in runoff and infiltrating water is a concern, especially where intensive livestock production is carried out.  In the US, in a comparison of 32 industries, the livestock industry was found to have a relatively good record of compliance with environmental regulations pursuant to the Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act, but pollution issues from large livestock operations can sometimes be serious where violations occur.  Various measures have been suggested by the US Environmental Protection Agency, among others, which can help reduce livestock damage to streamwater quality and riparian environments.\nChanges in livestock production practices influence the environmental impact of meat production, as illustrated by some beef data.  In the US beef production system, practices prevailing in 2007 are estimated to have involved 8.6% less fossil fuel use, 16% less greenhouse gas emissions (estimated as 100-year carbon dioxide equivalents), 12% less withdrawn water use and 33% less land use, per unit mass of beef produced, than in 1977.  From 1980 to 2012 in the US, while population increased by 38%, the small ruminant inventory decreased by 42%, the cattle-and-calves inventory decreased by 17%, and methane emissions from livestock decreased by 18%;  yet despite the reduction in cattle numbers, US beef production increased over that period.\nSome impacts of meat-producing livestock .  These include waste reduction by conversion of human-inedible crop residues to food, use of livestock as an alternative to herbicides for control of invasive and noxious weeds and other vegetation management, use of animal manure as fertilizer as a substitute for those synthetic fertilizers that require considerable fossil fuel use for manufacture, grazing use for wildlife habitat enhancement, and carbon sequestration in response to grazing practices, among others. Conversely, according to some studies appearing in peer-reviewed journals, the growing demand for meat is contributing to  as it is a significant driver of  and habitat destruction. Moreover, the 2019  by  also warns that ever increasing land use for meat production plays a significant role in biodiversity loss. A 2006  report, , found that around 26% of the planet's terrestrial surface is devoted to livestock grazing.\nHuman activity is causing , which is the deterioration of the  through  such as air, water and soil; the destruction of ecosystems; ; the  of wildlife; and . It is defined as any change or disturbance to the environment perceived to be deleterious or undesirable. As indicated by the  equation, environmental impact (I) or degradation is caused by the combination of an already very large and increasing human population (P), continually increasing  or per capita affluence (A), and the application of resource-depleting and polluting technology (T).\nAccording to a 2018 study in , 87% of the oceans and 77% of land (excluding Antarctica) have been altered by anthropogenic activity, and 23% of the planet's landmass remains as .\nHabitat fragmentation is the reduction of large tracts of habitat leading to habitat loss. Habitat fragmentation and loss are considered as being the main cause of the loss of biodiversity and degradation of the ecosystem all over the world. Human actions are greatly responsible for habitat fragmentation, and loss as these actions alter the connectivity and quality of habitats. Understanding the consequences of habitat fragmentation is important for the preservation of biodiversity and enhancing the functioning of the ecosystem.\nBoth agricultural plants and animals depend on pollination for reproduction. Vegetables and fruits are an important diet for human beings and depend on pollination. Whenever there is habitat destruction, pollination is reduced and crop yield as well. Many pants also rely on animals and most especially those that eat fruit for seed dispersal. Therefore, the destruction of habitat for animal severely affects all the plant species that depend on them.\nBiodiversity generally refers to the variety and variability of life on Earth, and is represented by the number of different species there are on the planet. Since its introduction, Homo sapiens (the human species) has been killing off entire species either directly (such as through hunting) or indirectly (such as by ), causing the  of species at an alarming rate. Humans are the cause of the current , called the , driving extinctions to 100 to 1000 times the normal background rate. Though most experts agree that human beings have accelerated the rate of species extinction, some scholars have postulated without humans, the biodiversity of the Earth would grow at an exponential rate rather than decline. The Holocene extinction continues, with , ,  and the  being a few broader examples of an almost universal,  decline in biodiversity.  (and continued ) along with  are considered to be the primary drivers of this rapid decline. The 2017  stated that, among other things, this sixth extinction event unleashed by humanity could annihilate many current life forms and consign them to extinction by the end of this century.\n\n is the loss of animals from ecological communities.\nIt is estimated that more than 50 percent of all wildlife has been lost in the last 40 years. It is estimated that by 2020, 68% of the world's wildlife will be lost. In , there is believed to be a 70 percent loss. A May 2018 study published in  found that 83% of wild mammals, 80% of marine mammals, 50% of plants and 15% of fish have been lost since the dawn of human civilization. Currently, livestock make up 60% of the  of all mammals on earth, followed by humans (36%) and wild mammals (4%). According to the 2019  by , human civilization has pushed one million species of plants and animals to the brink of extinction, with many of these projected to vanish over the next few decades.\nWhenever there is a decline in plant biodiversity, the remaining plants start to experience diminishing productivity. As a result, the loss of biodiversity continues being a threat to the productivity of the ecosystem all over the world, and this over ally impacts the natural ecosystem functioning. \nA 2019 report that assessed a total of 28,000 plant species concluded that close to half of them were facing a threat of extinction. The failure of noticing and appreciating plants is regarded as \"plant blindness\", and this is a worrying trend as it puts more plants at the threat of extinction than animals. Our increased farming has come at a higher cost to plant biodiversity as half of the habitable land on Earth is used for agriculture, and this is one of the major reasons behind the plant extinction crisis.\nIntroductions of species, particularly plants into new areas, by whatever means and for whatever reasons have brought about major and permanent changes to the environment over large areas.  Examples include the introduction of  into the Mediterranean, the introduction of oat species into the California grasslands, and the introduction of privet, kudzu, and  to North America.  Rats, cats, and goats have radically altered biodiversity in many islands.  Additionally, introductions have resulted in genetic changes to native fauna where interbreeding has taken place, as with  with domestic cattle, and wolves with domestic dogs.\nBecause of human overpopulation,  are dying around the world. In particular, coral mining,  (organic and non-organic), ,  and the digging of  and access into islands and bays are serious threats to these ecosystems. Coral reefs also face high dangers from pollution, diseases, destructive fishing practices and warming oceans. In order to find answers for these problems, researchers study the various factors that impact reefs. The list of factors is long, including the ocean's role as a , atmospheric changes, , , biological , impacts of  carrying agents to far flung reefs, pollutants,  and others. Reefs are threatened well beyond coastal areas.\nGeneral estimates show approximately 10% world's coral reefs are already dead. It is estimated that about 60% of the world's reefs are at risk due to destructive, human-related activities. The threat to the health of reefs is particularly strong in , where 80% of reefs are .\nDomestic, industrial and agricultural wastewater makes its way to wastewater plants for treatment before being released into aquatic ecosystems. Wastewater at these treatment plants contains a cocktail of different chemical and biological contaminants which may influence surrounding ecosystems. For example, the nutrient rich water supports large populations of pollutant-tolerant , which in-turn attract . These insects accumulate toxins in their exoskeletons and pass them on to insectivorous birds and bats. As a result, metals may accumulate in the tissues and organs of these animals, resulting in DNA damage, and histopathological lesions. Furthermore, this altered diet of fat-rich prey may cause changes in energy storage and hormone production, which may have significant impacts on , reproduction, metabolism and survival.\nBiological contaminants such as bacteria, viruses and fungi in wastewater can also be transferred to the surrounding ecosystem. Insects emerging from this wastewater may spread pathogens to nearby water sources. Pathogens, shed from humans, can be passed from this wastewater to organisms foraging at these treatment plants. This may lead to bacterial and viral infections or microbiome dysbiosis.\n is the result of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations which is caused primarily by the combustion of fossil energy sources such as petroleum, coal, and natural gas, and to an unknown extent by destruction of forests, increased methane, volcanic activity and cement production. Such massive alteration of the global  has only been possible because of the availability and deployment of advanced technologies, ranging in application from fossil fuel exploration, extraction, distribution, refining, and combustion in power plants and automobile engines and advanced farming practices. Livestock contributes to climate change both through the production of greenhouse gases and through destruction of  such as rain-forests. According to the 2006 United Nations/FAO report, 18% of all greenhouse gas emissions found in the atmosphere are due to livestock. The raising of livestock and the land needed to feed them has resulted in the destruction of millions of acres of rainforest and as global demand for meat rises, so too will the demand for land. Ninety-one percent of all rainforest land deforested since 1970 is now used for livestock. Potential negative environmental impacts caused by increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are rising global air temperatures, altered hydrogeological cycles resulting in more frequent and severe droughts, storms, and floods, as well as sea level rise and ecosystem disruption.\nThe fossils that are burned by humans for energy usually come back to them in the form of acid rain. Acid rain is a form of precipitation which has high sulfuric and nitric acids which can occur in the form of a fog or snow. Acid rain has numerous ecological impacts on streams, lakes, wetlands and other aquatic environments. It damages forests, robs the soil of its essential nutrients, releases aluminium to the soil, which makes it very hard for trees to absorb water.\nResearchers have discovered that kelp, eelgrass and other vegetation can effectively absorb carbon dioxide and hence reducing ocean acidity. Scientists, therefore, say that growing these plants could help in mitigating the damaging effects of acidification on marine life.\nOzone depletion damages plants all over the world and this includes both the plants in the natural ecosystems and the agricultural crops. It damages vegetation by entering through the leaf\u2019s stomata and burning that plant tissue during the respiration process. Ground-level ozone is known for causing more plant damage than any other all the combination of all other air pollutants.\nReduced ozone levels due to ozone depletion indicate that there is less protection from sun rays and more exposure to UVB radiation at the surface of the Earth. UVB radiation affects the developmental and physiological processes of plants. These effects include changes in plant form, the timing of developmental phases, distribution of nutrients within the plant and secondary metabolism.\nOf particular concern is NO, which has an average atmospheric lifetime of 114\u2013120 years, and is 300 times more effective than CO as a . NO produced by industrial processes, automobiles and agricultural fertilization and NH emitted from soils (i.e., as an additional byproduct of nitrification) and livestock operations are transported to downwind ecosystems, influencing N cycling and nutrient losses. Six major effects of NO and NH emissions have been identified:\nThe applications of technology often result in unavoidable and unexpected environmental impacts, which according to the  equation is measured as resource use or pollution generated per unit GDP. Environmental impacts caused by the application of technology are often perceived as unavoidable for several reasons. First, given that the purpose of many technologies is to exploit, control, or otherwise \u201cimprove\u201d upon nature for the perceived benefit of humanity while at the same time the myriad of processes in nature have been optimized and are continually adjusted by evolution, any disturbance of these natural processes by technology is likely to result in negative environmental consequences. Second, the conservation of mass principle and the  (i.e., conservation of energy) dictate that whenever material resources or energy are moved around or manipulated by technology, environmental consequences are inescapable. Third, according to the , order can be increased within a system (such as the human economy) only by increasing disorder or  outside the system (i.e., the environment). Thus, technologies can create \u201corder\u201d in the human economy (i.e., order as manifested in buildings, factories, transportation networks, communication systems, etc.) only at the expense of increasing \u201cdisorder\u201d in the environment. According to a number of studies, increased entropy is likely to be correlated to negative environmental impacts.\nThe environmental impact of mining includes , formation of , loss of , and contamination of soil,  and  by chemicals from mining processes. In some cases, additional forest logging is done in the vicinity of mines to increase the available room for the storage of the created debris and soil. \nEven though plants need some heavy metals for their growth, excess of these metals is usually toxic to them. Plants that are polluted with heavy metals usually depict reduced growth, yield and performance. Pollution by heavy metals decreases the soil organic matter composition resulting in a decline in soil nutrients which then leads to a decline in the growth of plants or even death.\nBesides creating environmental damage, the contamination resulting from leakage of chemicals also affect the health of the local population. Mining companies in some countries are required to follow environmental and rehabilitation codes, ensuring the area mined is returned to close to its original state. Some mining methods may have significant environmental and public health effects. Heavy metals usually exhibit toxic effects towards the soil biota, and this is through the affection of the microbial processes and decreases the number as well as activity of soil microorganisms. Low concentration of heavy metals also has high chances of inhibiting the plant's physiological metabolism. \nThe environmental impact of  and  is diverse. In recent years there has been a trend towards the increased .\nIn the real world,  of fossil fuel resources leads to  and climate change. However, little change is being made in many parts of the world. If the  theory proves true, more explorations of viable alternative energy sources, could be more friendly to the environment.\nRapidly advancing technologies can achieve a transition of energy generation, water and waste management, and food production towards better environmental and energy usage practices using methods of  and .\nThe environmental impact of  includes energy use, greenhouse gas emissions and some other kinds of pollution.  A joint life cycle analysis by the US Department of Agriculture and the US Department of Energy found that substituting 100% biodiesel for petroleum diesel in buses reduced life cycle consumption of petroleum by 95%.  Biodiesel reduced net emissions of carbon dioxide by 78.45%, compared with petroleum diesel.  In urban buses, biodiesel reduced particulate emissions 32 percent, carbon monoxide emissions 35 percent, and emissions of sulfur oxides 8%, relative to life cycle emissions associated with use of petroleum diesel.  Life cycle emissions of hydrocarbons were 35% higher and emission of various nitrogen oxides (NOx) were 13.5% higher with biodiesel.  Life cycle analyses by the Argonne National Laboratory have indicated reduced fossil energy use and reduced greenhouse gas emissions with biodiesel, compared with petroleum diesel use.  Biodiesel derived from various vegetable oils (e.g. canola or soybean oil), is readily biodegradable in the environment compared with petroleum diesel.\nThe environmental impact of  and -burning is diverse. Legislation passed by the US Congress in 1990 required the  (EPA) to issue a plan to alleviate   from . After delay and litigation, the EPA now has a court-imposed deadline of March 16, 2011, to issue its report.\nThe environmental impact of  is significant because modern society uses large amounts of electrical power. This power is normally generated at  that convert some other kind of energy into . Each such system has advantages and disadvantages, but many of them pose environmental concerns.\nThe environmental impact of  results from the  processes including mining, processing, transporting and storing fuel and  fuel waste. Released  pose a health danger to human populations, animals and plants as radioactive particles enter organisms through various transmission routes.\nRadiation is a  and causes numerous effects on living organisms and systems. The environmental impacts of nuclear power plant disasters such as the , the  and the , among others, persist indefinitely, though several other factors contributed to these events including improper management of fail safe systems and natural disasters putting uncommon stress on the generators. The radioactive decay rate of particles varies greatly, dependent upon the nuclear properties of a particular isotope. Radioactive  has a half-life of 80.8 million years, which indicates the time duration required for half of a given sample to decay, though very little plutonium-244 is produced in the nuclear fuel cycle and lower half-life materials have lower activity thus giving off less dangerous radiation.\nThe environmental impact of the oil shale industry includes the consideration of issues such as , ,  and  caused by the  of .  of  causes the usual environmental impacts of . In addition, the  and  generate waste material, which must be disposed of, and harmful atmospheric emissions, including , a major . Experimental in-situ conversion processes and  technologies may reduce some of these concerns in future, but may raise others, such as the pollution of groundwater.\nThe environmental impact of  is often negative because it is  to almost all forms of life. Petroleum, a common word for oil or natural gas, is closely linked to virtually all aspects of present society, especially for transportation and heating for both homes and for commercial activities.\nThe environmental impact of reservoirs is coming under ever increasing scrutiny as the world demand for water and energy increases and the number and size of reservoirs increases.\n and the  can be used to supply , generate  power, increasing the water supply for , provide recreational opportunities and flood control. However, adverse environmental and sociological impacts have also been identified during and after many reservoir constructions. Although the impact varies greatly between different dams and reservoirs, common criticisms include preventing sea-run fish from reaching their historical mating grounds, less access to water downstream, and a smaller catch for fishing communities in the area. Advances in technology have provided solutions to many negative impacts of dams but these advances are often not viewed as worth investing in if not required by law or under the threat of fines. Whether reservoir projects are ultimately beneficial or detrimental\u2014to both the environment and surrounding human populations\u2014 has been debated since the 1960s and probably long before that. In 1960 the construction of  and the flooding of  provoked political uproar which continues to this day. More recently, the construction of  and other similar projects throughout ,  and  have generated considerable environmental and political debate.\nCompared to the environmental impact of traditional energy sources, the environmental impact of wind power is relatively minor.  electricity generation consumes no fuel, and emits no , unlike fossil fuel power sources. The energy consumed to manufacture and transport the materials used to build a wind power plant is equal to the new energy produced by the plant within a few months. While a wind farm may cover a large area of land, many land uses such as agriculture are compatible, with only small areas of turbine foundations and infrastructure made unavailable for use.\nThere are reports of bird and bat mortality at wind turbines, as there are around other artificial structures. The scale of the ecological impact may or may not be significant, depending on specific circumstances. Prevention and mitigation of wildlife fatalities, and protection of , affect the siting and operation of wind turbines.\nThere are conflicting reports about the effects of noise on people who live very close to a wind turbine.\nThe environmental impact of  is diverse. In recent years, measures have been taken to reduce these effects.\n's environmental impact can be split into two aspects: the potential for nanotechnological innovations to help improve the environment, and the possibly novel type of pollution that nanotechnological materials might cause if released into the environment. As nanotechnology is an emerging field, there is great debate regarding to what extent industrial and commercial use of  will affect organisms and ecosystems.\nThe environmental impact of paint is diverse. Traditional  materials and processes can have harmful effects on the , including those from the use of  and other additives. Measures can be taken to reduce environmental impact, including accurately estimating paint quantities so that wastage is minimized, use of paints, coatings, painting accessories and techniques that are environmentally preferred. The  guidelines and  ratings are some of the standards that can be applied.\nThe environmental impact of paper is significant, which has led to changes in industry and behaviour at both business and personal levels. With the use of modern technology such as the  and the highly mechanised harvesting of wood, paper has become a cheap commodity. This has led to a high level of consumption and waste. With the rise in environmental awareness due to the lobbying by  and with increased government regulation there is now a trend towards  in the .\nSome scientists suggest that by 2050 there could be more plastic than fish in the oceans.\nThe environmental impact of  is often greater than what is intended by those who use them. Over 98% of sprayed insecticides and 95% of herbicides reach a destination other than their target species, including nontarget species, air, water, bottom sediments, and food. Pesticide contaminates land and water when it escapes from production sites and storage tanks, when it runs off from fields, when it is discarded, when it is sprayed aerially, and when it is sprayed into water to kill algae.\nThe amount of pesticide that migrates from the intended application area is influenced by the particular chemical's properties: its propensity for binding to soil, its , its water , and its resistance to being broken down over time. Factors in the soil, such as its texture, its ability to retain water, and the amount of organic matter contained in it, also affect the amount of pesticide that will leave the area. Some pesticides contribute to  and the depletion of the .\nThe environmental impact of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) is largely speculative. PPCPs are substances used by individuals for personal health or  reasons and the products used by  to boost growth or health of livestock. PPCPs have been detected in water bodies throughout the world. The effects of these chemicals on humans and the environment are not yet known, but to date there is no scientific evidence that they affect human health.\nThe environmental impact of  is significant because it is a major user of , and burns most of the world's . This creates , including  and , and is a significant contributor to  through emission of , for which transport is the fastest-growing emission sector. By subsector, road transport is the largest contributor to global warming.\n in developed countries have reduced the individual vehicles emission; however, this has been offset by an increase in the number of vehicles, and more use of each vehicle. Some pathways to reduce the carbon emissions of road vehicles considerably have been studied. Energy use and emissions vary largely between modes, causing  to call for a transition from air and road to rail and human-powered transport, and increase  and .\nOther environmental impacts of transport systems include  and automobile-oriented , which can consume natural habitat and agricultural lands. By reducing transportation emissions globally, it is predicted that there will be significant positive effects on Earth's , ,  and climate change.\nThe health impact of transport emissions is also of concern. A recent survey of the studies on the effect of traffic emissions on pregnancy outcomes has linked exposure to emissions to adverse effects on gestational duration and possibly also intrauterine growth.\nThe environmental impact of aviation occurs because  emit , particulates, and gases which contribute to  and . Despite emission reductions from automobiles and more fuel-efficient and less polluting  and  engines, the rapid growth of  in recent years contributes to an increase in total pollution attributable to . In the ,  emissions from aviation increased by 87% between 1990 and 2006. Among  leading to this phenomenon are the increasing number of  and social factors that are making air travel commonplace, such as .\nThere is an ongoing debate about possible  of air travel and the inclusion of aviation in an  scheme, with a view to ensuring that the total  of aviation are taken into account.\nThe environmental impact of roads includes the local effects of  (public ) such as on noise, , , /disturbance and local ; and the wider effects including  from vehicle emissions. The design, construction and management of ,  and other related facilities as well as the design and regulation of  can change the impacts to varying degrees.\nThe environmental impact of  includes  emissions and . In 2007,  emissions from shipping were estimated at 4 to 5% of the global total, and estimated by the  (IMO) to rise by up to 72% by 2020 if no action is taken. There is also a potential for introducing invasive species into new areas through shipping, usually by attaching themselves to the ship's hull.\nThe First Intersessional Meeting of the IMO Working Group on Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Ships took place in ,  on 23\u201327 June 2008. It was tasked with developing the technical basis for the reduction mechanisms that may form part of a future IMO regime to control greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping, and a draft of the actual reduction mechanisms themselves, for further consideration by IMO's Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC).\nGeneral military spending and military activities have marked environmental effects. The United States military is considered one of the worst polluters in the world, responsible for over 39,000 sites contaminated with hazardous materials. Several studies have also found a strong positive correlation between higher military spending and higher  where increased military spending has a larger effect on increasing carbon emissions in the Global North than in the Global South. Military activities also affect land use and are extremely resource-intensive.\nThe military does not solely have negative effects on the environment. There are several examples of militaries aiding in land management, conservation, and greening of an area. Additionally, certain military technologies have proven extremely helpful for conservationists and environmental scientists.\nAs well as the cost to human life and society, there is a significant environmental impact of war.  methods during, or after war have been in use for much of recorded history but with modern  war can cause a far greater devastation on the .  can render land unusable for further use or make access across it dangerous or fatal.\nArtificial light at night is one of the most obvious physical changes that humans have made to the biosphere, and is the easiest form of pollution to observe from space. The main environmental impacts of artificial light are due to light's use as an information source (rather than an energy source). The hunting efficiency of visual predators generally increases under artificial light, changing . Artificial light also affects , , and  levels, resulting in disrupted .\n"},

This contradictory process is described by Peck and Tickell as roll back/roll out neoliberalism in which on one hand the state willingly gives up the control over resources and responsibility for social provision while on the other, it engages in \u201cpurposeful construction and consolidation of neoliberalised state forms, modes of governance, and regulatory relations\".\nThere has been a growing interest in the effects of neoliberalism on the politics of the non-human world of environmental governance. Neoliberalism is seen to be more than a homogenous and monolithic \u2018thing\u2019 with a clear end point. It is a series of path-dependent, spatially and temporally \u201cconnected neoliberalisation\u201d processes which affect and are affected by nature and environment that \u201ccover a remarkable array of places, regions and countries\u201d.  Co-opting neoliberal ideas of the importance of private property and the protection of individual (investor) rights, into environmental governance can be seen in the example of recent multilateral trade agreements (see in particular the ). Such neoliberal structures further reinforce a process of nature enclosure and primitive accumulation or \u201caccumulation by dispossession\u201d that serves to privatise increasing areas of nature. The ownership-transfer of resources traditionally not privately owned to free market mechanisms is believed to deliver greater efficiency and optimal return on investment. Other similar examples of neo-liberal inspired projects include the enclosure of minerals, the fisheries quota system in the North Pacific and the  and  in England and Wales. All three examples share neoliberal characteristics to \u201cdeploy markets as the solution to environmental problems\u201d in which scarce natural resources are commercialized and turned into commodities. The approach to frame the ecosystem in the context of a price-able commodity is also present in the work of neoliberal geographers who subject nature to price and supply/demand mechanisms where the earth is considered to be a  resource (, for example, estimates the earth  value to be between 16 and  per year).\n \u2013 The development-centric vision that prevails in most countries and international institutions advocates a headlong rush towards more economic growth. Environmental economists on the other hand, point to a close correlation between economic growth and , arguing for qualitative development as an alternative to growth. As a result, the past couple of decades has seen a big shift towards sustainable development as an alternative to neo-liberal economics. There are those, particularly within the alternative globalization movement, who maintain that it is feasible to change to a  phase without losing social efficiency or lowering the .\n \u2013 The growth of consumption and the cult of consumption, or  ideology, is the major cause of economic growth. Overdevelopment, seen as the only alternative to poverty, has become an end in itself. The means for curbing this growth are not equal to the task, since the phenomenon is not confined to a growing middle class in developing countries, but also concerns the development of irresponsible lifestyles, particularly in northern countries, such as the increase in the size and number of homes and cars per person.\n \u2013 The complexity of the planet's ecosystems means that the loss of any species has unexpected consequences. The stronger the impact on biodiversity, the stronger the likelihood of a chain reaction with unpredictable negative effects. Another important factor of environmental degradation that falls under this destruction of biodiversity, and must not be ignored is . Despite all the damage inflicted, a number of ecosystems have proved to be . Environmentalists are endorsing a precautionary principle whereby all potentially damaging activities would have to be analyzed for their .\n \u2013 Forecasts predict 8.9 billion people on the planet in 2050. This is a subject which primarily affects developing countries, but also concerns northern countries; although their demographic growth is lower, the environmental impact per person is far higher in these countries. Demographic growth needs to be countered by developing education and family planning programs and generally improving women's status.\n\"\" - Pollution caused by the use of fossil fuels is another driver of environmental destruction. The burning of carbon-based fossil fuels such as coal and oil, releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. One of the major impacts of this is the climate change that is currently taking place on the planet, where the earth's temperature is gradually rising. Given that fuels such as coal and oil are the most heavily used fuels, this a great concern to many environmentalists.\n\"Agricultural practices\" - Destructive agricultural practices such as overuse of fertilizers and  lead to land degradation. The soil gets , and leads to silting in rivers and reservoirs. Soil erosion is a continuous cycle and ultimately results in  of the land. Apart from ,  is also a possibility; chemicals used in farming can  into rivers and .\nThe crisis by the impact of human activities on nature calls for governance. Which includes responses by international institutions, governments and citizens, who should meet this crisis by pooling the experience and knowledge of each of the agents and institutions concerned.\nThe  measures taken remain insufficient. The necessary reforms require time, energy, money and diplomatic negotiations. The situation has not generated a unanimous response. Persistent divisions slow progress towards global environmental governance.\nThe global nature of the crisis limits the effects of national or sectoral measures. Cooperation is necessary between actors and institutions in international trade, sustainable development and .\nGlobal, continental, national and local governments have employed a variety of approaches to environmental governance. Substantial positive and negative spillovers limit the ability of any single jurisdiction to resolve issues.\nChallenges facing environmental governance include:\nAll of these challenges have implications on governance, however international environmental governance is necessary. The IDDRI claims that rejection of  in the name of efficiency and protection of national interests conflicts with the promotion of international law and the concept of global public goods. Others cite the complex nature of environmental problems.\nOn the other hand, The  program has been implemented in over 7,000 communities. Environmental problems, including global-scale problems, may not always require global solutions. For example, marine pollution can be tackled regionally, and ecosystem deterioration can be addressed locally. Other global problems such as climate change benefit from local and regional action.\nB\u00e4ckstrand and Saward wrote, \u201csustainability and environmental protection is an arena in which innovative experiments with new hybrid, plurilateral forms of governance, along with the incorporation of a transnational civil society spanning the public-private divide, are taking place.\u201d\nA 1997 report observed a global consensus that sustainable development implementation should be based on local level solutions and initiatives designed with and by the local communities. Community participation and partnership along with the decentralisation of government power to local communities are important aspects of environmental governance at the local level. Initiatives such as these are integral divergence from earlier environmental governance approaches which was \u201cdriven by state agendas and resource control\u201d and followed a top-down or trickle down approach rather than the bottom up approach that local level governance encompasses. The adoption of practices or interventions at a local scale can, in part, be explained by  theory. In Tanzania and in the Pacific, researchers have illustrated that aspects of the intervention, of the adopter, and of the social-ecological context all shape why community-centered conservation interventions spread through space and time. Local level governance shifts decision making power away from the state and/or governments to the grassroots. Local level governance is extremely important even on a global scale. Environmental governance at the global level is defined as international and as such has resulted in the marginalisation of local voices. Local level governance is important to bring back power to local communities in the global fight against environmental degridation.  Pulgar Vidal observed a \u201cnew institutional framework, [wherein] decision-making regarding access to and use of natural resources has become increasingly decentralized.\u201d He noted four techniques that can be used to develop these processes:\nHe found that the key conditions for developing decentralized environmental governance are:\nThe legitimacy of decisions depends on the local population's participation rate and on how well participants represent that population.\nWith regard to public authorities, questions linked to biodiversity can be faced by adopting appropriate policies and strategies, through exchange of knowledge and experience, the forming of partnerships, correct management of land use, monitoring of biodiversity and optimal use of resources, or reducing consumption, and promoting environmental certifications, such as EMAS and/or ISO 14001. Local authorities undoubtedly have a central role to play in the protection of biodiversity and this strategy is successful above all when the authorities show strength by involving stakeholders in a credible environmental improvement project and activating a transparent and effective communication policy (Ioppolo et al., 2013).\nStates play a crucial role in environmental governance, because \"however far and fast international economic integration proceeds, political authority remains vested in national governments\". It is for this reason that governments should respect and support the commitment to implementation of international agreements.\nAt the state level,  has been found to be conducive to the creation of roundtables and committees. In France, the  process:\nIf environmental issues are excluded from e.g., the economic agenda, this may delegitimize those institutions.\n\u201cIn southern countries, the main obstacle to the integration of intermediate levels in the process of territorial environmental governance development is often the dominance of developmentalist inertia in states\u2019 political mindset. The question of the environment has not been effectively integrated in national development planning and programs. Instead, the most common idea is that environmental protection curbs economic and social development, an idea encouraged by the frenzy for exporting raw materials extracted using destructive methods that consume resources and fail to generate any added value.\u201d Of course they are justified in this thinking, as their main concerns are social injustices such as poverty alleviation. Citizens in some of these states have responded by developing empowerment strategies to ease poverty through sustainable development. In addition to this, policymakers must be more aware of these concerns of the global south, and must make sure to integrate a strong focus on social justice in their policies.\nAt the global level there are numerous important actors involved in environmental governance and \"a range of institutions contribute to and help define the practice of global environmental governance. The idea of global environmental governance is to govern the environment at a global level through a range of nation states and non state actors such as national governments,  and other international organisations such as UNEP (). Global environmental governance is the answer to calls for new forms of governance because of the increasing complexity of the international agenda. It is perceived to be an effective form of multilateral management and essential to the international community in meeting goals of mitigation and the possible reversal of the impacts on the global environment. However, a precise definition of global environmental governance is still vague and there are many issues surrounding global governance.\nElliot argues that \u201cthe congested institutional terrain still provides more of an appearance than a reality of comprehensive global governance.\u201d  This meant that there are too many institutions within the global governance of the environment for it to be completely inclusive and coherent leaving it merely portraying the image of this to the global public. Global environmental governance is about more than simply expanding networks of institutions and decision makers. \u201cIt is a political practice which simultaneously reflects, constitutes and masks global relations of power and powerlessness.\u201d State agendas exploit the use of global environmental governance to enhance their oven agendas or wishes even if this is at the detriment of the vital element behind global environmental governance which is the environment. Elliot states that global environmental governance \u201cis neither normatively neutral nor materially benign.\u201d\nAs explored by Newell, report notes by The Global Environmental Outlook noted that the systems of global environmental governance are becoming increasingly irrelevant or impotent due to patterns of globalisation such as; imbalances in productivity and the distribution of goods and services, unsustainable progression of extremes of wealth and poverty and population and economic growth overtaking environmental gains. Newell states that, despite such acknowledgements, the \u201cmanaging of global environmental change within International Relations continues to look to international regimes for the answers.\u201d\nThe literature on governance scale shows how changes in the understanding of  have led to the movement from a local view to recognising their larger and more complicated scale. This move brought an increase in the diversity, specificity and complexity of initiatives. Meadowcroft pointed out innovations that were layered on top of existing structures and processes, instead of replacing them.\nLafferty and Meadowcroft give three examples of multi-tiered governance: , increasingly comprehensive approaches, and involvement of multiple governmental entities.  Lafferty and Meadowcroft described the resulting multi-tiered system as addressing issues on both smaller and wider scales.\n claimed that a mismatch between the scale of the environmental problem and the level of the policy intervention was problematic.  Young claimed that such mismatches reduced the effectiveness of interventions.  Most of the literature addresses the level of  rather than ecological scale.\n, amongst others, claimed that the mismatch is often the cause of unsustainable management practices and that simple solutions to the mismatch have not been identified.\nConsiderable debate has addressed the question of which level(s) should take responsibility for fresh water management. Development workers tend to address the problem at the local level. National governments focus on policy issues. This can create conflicts among states because rivers cross borders, leading to efforts to evolve governance of  .\n\n and  reduces its  for capturing,  and recycling water, energy and food.  proposed solutions in the following domains:\nThe scientific consensus on  is expressed in the reports of  (IPCC) and also in the statements by all major scientific bodies in the United States such as .\nThe drivers of climate change can include\n- Changes in \n- Changes in atmospheric  and  concentrations\nEvidence of climate change can be identified by examining\n- Atmospheric concentrations of  (GHGs) such as  (CO2)\n- Land and sea surface temperatures\n- Atmospheric water vapor\n- \n- The occurrence or strength of extreme weather and climate events\n- \n- Rapid sea \n- Sea level\nIt is suggested by climate models that the changes in temperature and sea level can be the causal effects of human activities such as  of fossil fuels, , increased  and production of  gases.\nThere has been increasing actions in order to mitigate climate change and reduce its impact at national, regional and international levels.  and  (UNFCCC) plays the most important role in addressing climate change at an international level.\nThe goal of combating climate change led to the adoption of the  by 191 states, an agreement encouraging the reduction of , mainly . Since developed economies produce more emissions per capita, limiting emissions in all countries inhibits opportunities for emerging economies, the only major success in efforts to produce a global response to the phenomenon.\nTwo decades following the , however, there has been no improvement in the key indicators highlighted.\nEnvironmental governance for protecting the  has to act in many levels. Biodiversity is fragile because it is threatened by almost all human actions. To promote conservation of biodiversity, agreements and laws have to be created to regulate agricultural activities, ,  of countries, , control of ,  the correct use of water and protection of . Before making any decision for a region or country decision makers, politicians and community have to take into account what are the potential impacts for biodiversity, that any project can have.\n and  have been a great contributor for deforestation. Also, population growth requires more intense agricultural areas use, which also results in necessity of new areas to be deforested. This causes , which is one of the major threats for biodiversity. Habitat loss and   affects all species, because they all rely on limited resources, to feed on and to breed.\n\u2018\u2019.\nTo avoid habitat loss, and consequently , politicians and lawmakers should be aware of the precautionary principle, which means that before approving a project or law all the pros and cons should be carefully analysed. Sometimes the impacts are not explicit, or not even proved to exist. However, if there is any chance of an irreversible impact happen, it should be taken into consideration.\nTo promote environmental governance for biodiversity protection there has to be a clear articulation between values and interests while negotiating environmental management plans. International agreements are good way to have it done right.\nThe  (CBD) was signed in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 human activities. The CBD's objectives are: \u201cto conserve biological diversity, to use biological diversity in a sustainable fashion, to share the benefits of biological diversity fairly and equitably.\u201d The Convention is the first global agreement to address all aspects of biodiversity: genetic resources, species and ecosystems. It recognizes, for the first time, that the conservation of biological diversity is \u201ca common concern for all humanity\u201d. The       Convention encourages joint efforts on measures for scientific and technological cooperation, access to genetic resources and the transfer of clean environmental technologies.\nThe Convention on Biological Diversity most important edition happened in 2010 when the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and the , were launched. These two projects together make the United Nations decade on Biodiversity. It was held in Japan and has the targets of \u2018\u2019.  The Strategic Plan for Biodiversity has the goal to \u2018\u2019 As result (...) \u2018\u2019. According to the CBD  the five Aichi targets are:\n\nThe 2003  claimed that the amount of water available over the next twenty years would drop by 30%.In the same report, it is indicated that in 1998, 2.2 million people died from diarrhoeal diseases. In 2004, the UK's  charity reported that one child died every 15 seconds from water-linked diseases.\nAccording to Alliance 21 \u201cAll levels of water supply management are necessary and independent. The integrated approach to the catchment areas must take into account the needs of  and those of towns, jointly and not separately as is often seen to be the case....The governance of a water supply must be guided by the principles of sustainable development.\u201d\n  have always been variable but they are becoming increasingly so with changing climate conditions. Because of how limited water resources are in Australia, there needs to be an effective implementation of environmental governance conducted within the country. Water restrictions are an important policy device used in Australian environmental governance to limit the amount of water used in urban and agricultural environments (Beeton et al. 2006). There is increased pressure on surface water resources in Australia because of the uncontrolled growth in  use and the constant threat of drought. These increased pressures not only affect the quantity and quality of the waterways but they also negatively affect biodiversity. The government needs to create policies that preserve, protect and monitor Australia's inland water. The most significant environmental governance policy imposed by the Australian government is environmental flow allocations that allocate water to the natural environment. The proper implementation of  systems could help to conserve water resources in Australia. Over the years there has been an increase in demand for water, making Australia the third largest per capita user of water in the world (Beeton et al. 2006). If this trend continues, the gap between supply and demand will need to be addressed. The government needs to implement more efficient water allocations and raise water rates (UNEP, 2014). By changing public perception to promote the action of reusing and recycling water some of the stress of water shortages can be alleviated.  More extensive solutions like desalination plants, building more dams and using aquifer storage are all options that could be taken to conserve water levels but all these methods are controversial. With caps on surface water use, both urban and rural consumers are turning to groundwater use; this has caused groundwater levels to decline significantly. Groundwater use is very hard to monitor and regulate. There is not enough research currently being conducted to accurately determine sustainable yields. Some regions are seeing improvement in groundwater levels by applying caps on bores and the amount of water that consumers are allowed to extract. There have been projects in environmental governance aimed at restoring vegetation in the riparian zone. Restoring riparian vegetation helps increase biodiversity, reduce salinity, prevent soil erosion and prevent riverbank collapse. Many rivers and waterways are controlled by weirs and locks that control the flow of rivers and also prevent the movement of fish. The government has funded fish-ways on some weirs and locks to allow for native fish to move upstream. Wetlands have significantly suffered under restricted water resources with water bird numbers dropping and a decrease in species diversity. The allocation of water for bird breeding through environmental flows in  has led to an increase in breeding (Beeton et al. 2006). Because of dry land salinity throughout Australia there has been an increase in the levels of salt in Australian waterways. There has been funding in salt interception schemes which help to improve in-stream salinity levels but whether river salinity has improved or not is still unclear because there is not enough data available yet. High salinity levels are dangerous because they can negatively affect larval and juvenile stages of certain fish. The introduction of invasive species into waterways has negatively affected native aquatic species because invasive species compete with native species and alter natural habitats. There has been research in producing  to help eradicate carp. Government funding has also gone into building in-stream barriers that trap the carp and prevent them from moving into floodplains and wetlands.  Investment in national and regional programmes like the Living Murray (MDBC), Healthy Waterways Partnership and the Clean Up the Swan Programme are leading to important environmental governance. The Healthy Rivers programme promotes restoration and recovery of environmental flows, riparian re-vegetation and aquatic pest control.  The Living Murray programme has been crucial for the allocation of water to the environment by creating an agreement to recover 500 billion litres of water to the Murray River environment. Environmental governance and water resource management in Australia must be constantly monitored and adapted to suit the changing environmental conditions within the country (Beeton et al. 2006). If environmental programmes are governed with transparency there can be a reduction in policy fragmentation and an increase in policy efficiency (Mclntyre, 2010). In Arab countries, the extensive use of water for agriculture also needs critical attention since agriculture in this region has less contribution for its national income.   \n\n\n\nOn 16 September 1987 the United Nations General Assembly signed the  to address the declining . Since that time, the use of  (industrial refrigerants and aerosols) and farming fungicides such as  has mostly been eliminated, although other damaging gases are still in use.\nThe  is the primary multilateral agreement governing nuclear activity.\n are not the subject of any major multilateral agreements. They are the subject of various restrictions at other levels of governance. GMOs are in widespread use in the US, but are heavily restricted in many other jurisdictions.\nControversies have ensued over , , , disclosure and other topics.\nThe  or precautionary approach states that if an action or policy has a suspected risk of causing harm to the public or to the environment, in the absence of scientific consensus that the action or policy is harmful, the burden of proof that it is not harmful falls on those taking an action. As of 2013 it was not the basis of major multilateral agreements.\nThe Precautionary Principle is put into effect if there is a chance that proposed action may cause harm to the society or the environment. Therefore, those involved in the proposed action must provide evidence that it will not be harmful, even if scientists do not believe that it will cause harm. It falls upon the policymakers to make the optimal decision, if there is any risk, even without any credible scientific evidence. However, taking precautionary action also means that there is an element of cost involved, either social or economic. So if the cost was seen as insignificant the action would be taken without the implementation of the precautionary principle. But often the cost is ignored, which can lead to harmful repercussions. This is often the case with industry and scientists who are primarily concerned with protecting their own interests.\nLeading experts have emphasized on the importance of taking into account the security aspects the environment and natural resources will cause. The twenty-first century is looking into a future with an increase in mass migrations of refugees, wars and praetorian regimes caused by the effect of environmental degradation such as water scarcity, deforestation and soil erosion, air pollution and, climate change effects such as rising sea levels. For a long time, foreign-policy challenges have focused on social causes as being the only reason for social and political changes. However, it is a crucial moment to understand and take into consideration the security implications that environmental stress will bring to the current political and social structure around the globe.\nThe main multilateral conventions, also known as Rio Conventions, are as follows:\n (CBD) (1992\u20131993): aims to conserve biodiversity. Related agreements include the  on biosafety.\n (UNFCC) (1992\u20131994): aims to stabilize concentrations of greenhouse gases at a level that would  without threatening food production, and enabling the pursuit of sustainable economic development; it incorporates the .\n (UNCCD) (1994\u20131996): aims to combat desertification and mitigate the effects of drought and desertification, in developing countries (Though initially the convention was primarily meant for Africa).\nFurther conventions:\nThe Rio Conventions are characterized by:\nEnvironmental conventions are regularly criticized for their:\nUntil now, the formulation of environmental policies at the international level has been divided by theme, sector or territory, resulting in treaties that overlap or clash. International attempts to coordinate environment institutions, include the Inter-Agency Coordination Committee and the , but these institutions are not powerful enough to effectively incorporate the three aspects of sustainable development.\nMEAs are agreements between several countries that apply internationally or regionally and concern a variety of environmental questions. As of 2013 over 500 Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs), including 45 of global scope involve at least 72 signatory countries. Further agreements cover regional environmental problems, such as  or pollution in the Mediterranean. Each agreement has a specific mission and objectives ratified by multiple states.\nMany Multilateral Environmental Agreements have been negotiated with the support from the United Nations Environmental Programme and work towards the achievement of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals as a means to instil sustainable practices for the environment and its people. Multilateral Environmental Agreements are considered to present enormous opportunities for greener societies and economies which can deliver numerous benefits in addressing food, energy and water security and in achieving sustainable development. These agreements can be implemented on a global or regional scale, for example the issues surrounding the disposal of hazardous waste can be implemented on a regional level as per the Bamako Convention on the Ban of the Import into Africa and the Control of Transboundary Movement and Management of Hazardous Waste within Africa which applies specifically to Africa, or the global approach to hazardous waste such as the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal which is monitored throughout the world.\n\u201cThe environmental governance structure defined by the Rio and Johannesburg Summits is sustained by , MEAs and developmental organizations and consists of assessment and policy development, as well as project implementation at the country level.\n\"The governance structure consists of a chain of phases:\n\"Traditionally, UNEP has focused on the normative role of engagement in the first three\nphases. Phases (d) to (f) are covered by MEAs and the sustainable development phase involves developmental organizations such as UNDP and the World Bank.\u201d\nLack of coordination affects the development of coherent governance. The report shows that donor states support development organizations, according to their individual interests. They do not follow a joint plan, resulting in overlaps and duplication. MEAs tend not to become a joint frame of reference and therefore receive little financial support. States and organizations emphasize existing regulations rather than improving and adapting them.\nThe risks associated with nuclear fission raised global awareness of environmental threats. The 1963  prohibiting atmospheric nuclear testing was the beginning of the globalization of environmental issues. Environmental law began to be modernized and coordinated with the  (1972), backed up in 1980 by the Vienna Convention on the . The  was signed and ratified in 1985. In 1987, 24 countries signed the  which imposed the gradual withdrawal of CFCs.\nThe , published in 1987 by the , stipulated the need for economic development that \u201cmeets the needs of the present without compromising the capacity of future generations to meet their needs.\nThe United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), better known as the 1992 , was the first major international meeting since the end of the  and was attended by delegations from 175 countries. Since then the biggest international conferences that take place every 10 years guided the global governance process with a series of MEAs. Environmental treaties are applied with the help of .\nGovernments created international treaties in the 1990s to check global threats to the environment. These treaties are far more restrictive than global protocols and set out to change non-sustainable production and consumption models.\n is a detailed plan of actions to be implemented at the global, national and local levels by UN organizations, member states and key individual groups in all regions. Agenda 21 advocates making sustainable development a legal principle law. At the local level, local Agenda 21 advocates an inclusive, territory-based strategic plan, incorporating sustainable environmental and social policies.\nThe Agenda has been accused of using  principles, including free trade to achieve environmental goals. For example, chapter two, entitled \u201cInternational Cooperation to Accelerate Sustainable Development in Developing Countries and Related Domestic Policies\u201d states, \u201cThe international economy should provide a supportive international climate for achieving environment and development goals by: promoting sustainable development through trade liberalization.\u201d\nThe UNEP has had its biggest impact as a monitoring and advisory body, and in developing environmental agreements. It has also contributed to strengthening the institutional capacity of environment ministries.\nIn 2002 UNEP held a conference to focus on product lifecycle impacts, emphasizing the fashion, advertising, financial and retail industries, seen as key agents in promoting sustainable consumption.\nAccording to Ivanova, UNEP adds value in environmental monitoring, scientific assessment and information sharing, but cannot lead all environmental management processes. She proposed the following tasks for UNEP:\nOther proposals offer a new mandate to \u201cproduce greater unity amongst social and environmental agencies, so that the concept of \u2018environment for development\u2019 becomes a reality. It needs to act as a platform for establishing standards and for other types of interaction with national and international organizations and the United Nations. The principles of cooperation and  should be reflected in the application of this revised mandate.\u201d\nSherman proposed principles to strengthen UNEP:\nAnother group stated, \u201cConsider the specific needs of developing countries and respect of the fundamental principle of 'common but differentiated responsibilities'. Developed countries should promote technology transfer, new and additional financial resources, and capacity building for meaningful participation of developing countries in international environmental governance. Strengthening of international environmental governance should occur in the context of sustainable development and should involve civil society as an important stakeholder and agent of transformation.\u201d\nCreated in 1991, the Global Environment Facility is an independent financial organization initiated by donor governments including Germany and France. It was the first financial organization dedicated to the environment at the global level. As of 2013 it had 179 members. Donations are used for projects covering biodiversity, climate change, international waters, destruction of the ozone layer, soil degradation and .\nGEF's institutional structure includes UNEP, UNDP and the World Bank. It is the funding mechanism for the four environmental conventions: climate change, biodiversity, persistent organic pollutants and desertification. GEF transfers resources from developed countries to developing countries to fund UNDP, UNEP and World Bank projects. The World Bank manages the annual budget of US$561.10 million.\nThe GEF has been criticized for its historic links with the World Bank, at least during its first phase during the 1990s, and for having favoured certain regions to the detriment of others. Another view sees it as contributing to the emergence of a global \"green market\". It represents \u201can adaptation (of the World Bank) to this emerging world order, as a response to the emergence of environmental movements that are becoming a geopolitical force.\u201d  Developing countries demanded financial transfers to help them protect their environment.\nGEF is subject to economic profitability criteria, as is the case for all the . It received more funds in its first three years than the UNEP has since its creation in 1972. GEF funding represents less than 1% of development aid between 1992 and 2002.\nThis intergovernmental institution meets twice a year to assess follow-up on Rio Summit goals. The CSD is made up of 53 member states, elected every three years and was reformed in 2004 to help improve implementation of Agenda 21. It meets twice a year, focusing on a specific theme during each two-year period: 2004-2005 was dedicated to water and 2006-2007 to climate change. The CSD has been criticized for its low impact, general lack of presence and the absence of Agenda 21 at the state level specifically, according to a report by the . Its mission focuses on sequencing actions and establishing agreements puts it in conflict with institutions such as UNEP and OECD.\nA proposed World Environment Organization, analogous to the  could be capable of adapting treaties and enforcing international standards.\nThe European Union, particularly France and Germany, and a number of NGOs favour creating a WEO. The United Kingdom, the US and most developing countries prefer to focus on voluntary initiatives. WEO partisans maintain that it could offer better political leadership, improved legitimacy and more efficient coordination. Its detractors argue that existing institutions and missions already provide appropriate environmental governance; however the lack of coherence and coordination between them and the absence of clear division of responsibilities prevents them from greater effectiveness.\nThe World Bank influences environmental governance through other actors, particularly the GEF. The World Bank's mandate is not sufficiently defined in terms of environmental governance despite the fact that it is included in its mission. However, it allocates 5 to 10% of its annual funds to environmental projects. The institution's capitalist vocation means that its investment is concentrated solely in areas which are profitable in terms of cost benefits, such as climate change action and ozone layer protection, whilst neglecting other such as adapting to climate change and desertification. Its financial autonomy means that it can make its influence felt indirectly on the creation of standards, and on international and regional negotiations.\nFollowing intense criticism in the 1980s for its support for destructive projects which, amongst other consequences, caused deforestation of tropical forests, the World Bank drew up its own environment-related standards in the 1990s so it could correct its actions. These standards differ from UNEP's standards, meant to be the benchmark, thus discrediting the institution and sowing disorder and conflict in the world of environmental governance.

Criticism is not directed at the World Bank's standards in themselves, which Najam considered as \u201crobust\u201d, but at their legitimacy and efficacy.\nThe 's account of itself as of 2012  is as \"the largest public funder of projects to improve the global environment\", period, which \"provides grants for projects related to biodiversity, climate change, international waters, land degradation, the ozone layer, and persistent organic pollutants.\"  It claims to have provided \"$10.5 billion in grants and leveraging $51 billion in co-financing for over 2,700 projects in over 165 countries [and] made more than 14,000 small grants directly to civil society and community-based organizations, totaling $634 million.\"  It serves as mechanism for the:\nThis mandate reflects the restructured GEF as of October 2011 .\nThe WTO's mandate does not include a specific principle on the environment. All the problems linked to the environment are treated in such a way as to give priority to trade requirements and the principles of the WTO's own trade system. This produces conflictual situations. Even if the WTO recognizes the existence of MEAs, it denounces the fact that around 20 MEAs are in conflict with the WTO's trade regulations. Furthermore, certain MEAs can allow a country to ban or limit trade in certain products if they do not satisfy established environmental protection requirements. In these circumstances, if one country's ban relating to another country concerns two signatories of the same MEA, the principles of the treaty can be used to resolve the disagreement, whereas if the country affected by the trade ban with another country has not signed the agreement, the WTO demands that the dispute be resolved using the WTO's trade principles, in other words, without taking into account the environmental consequences.\nSome criticisms of the WTO mechanisms may be too broad.  In a recently dispute over labelling of  for  between the US and Mexico, the ruling was relatively narrow and did not, as some critics claimed,\nThe IMF's mission is \"\".\nThe IMF Green Fund proposal of  specifically to address \"climate-related shocks in Africa\", despite receiving serious attention was rejected. Strauss-Kahn's proposal, backed by  and , was that \"developed countries would make an initial capital injection into the fund using some of the $176 billion worth of SDR allocations from last year in exchange for a stake in the green fund.\"  However, \"most of the 24 directors ... told Strauss-Kahn that climate was not part of the IMF's mandate and that SDR allocations are a reserve asset never intended for development issues.\"\nThe UN's main body for coordinating municipal and urban decision-making is named the . Its slogan is \"Local Governments for Sustainability\".\nThis body sponsored the concept of  that makes environmental governance the foundation of other governance.\nICLEIs projects and achievements include:\nICLEI promotes  among municipal governments globally, especially , .\nOther international institutions incorporate environmental governance in their action plans, including:\nOver 30 UN agencies and programmes support environmental management, according to Najam. This produces a lack of coordination, insufficient exchange of information and dispersion of responsibilities. It also results in proliferation of initiatives and rivalry between them.\nAccording to Bauer, Busch and Siebenh\u00fcner, the different conventions and multilateral agreements of global environmental regulation is increasing their secretariats' influence. Influence varies according to bureaucratic and leadership efficiency, choice of technical or client-centered.\nThe United Nations is often the target of criticism, including from within over the multiplication of secretariats due to the chaos it produces. Using a separate secretariat for each MEA creates enormous overhead given the 45 international-scale and over 500 other agreements.\nEnvironmental protection has created opportunities for mutual and collective monitoring among neighbouring states. The European Union provides an example of the institutionalization of joint regional and state environmental governance. Key areas include information, led by the  (EEA), and the production and monitoring of norms by states or local institutions.\nSee also the .\nUS refusal to ratify major environment agreements produced tensions with ratifiers in Europe and Japan.\nThe World Bank, IMF and other institutions are dominated by the developed countries and do not always properly consider the requirements of developing countries.\nEnvironmental governance applies to business as well as government. Considerations are typical of those in other domains:\nWhite and Klernan among others discuss the correlation between environmental governance and financial performance. This correlation is higher in sectors where environmental impacts are greater.\nBusiness environmental issues include emissions, biodiversity, historical liabilities, product and material waste/recycling, energy use/supply and many others.\nEnvironmental governance has become linked to traditional corporate governance as an increasing number of shareholders are corporate environmental impacts. Corporate governance is the set of , customs, , laws, and institutions affecting the way a  (or ) is managed. Corporate  is affected by the relationships among .

Some consumers seek environmentally friendly and sustainable products and companies.\nAccording to B\u00e4ckstrand and Saward, \u201cbroader participation by non-state actors in multilateral environmental decisions (in varied roles such as agenda setting, campaigning, lobbying, consultation, monitoring, and implementation) enhances the democratic legitimacy of environmental governance.\u201d\nLocal activism is capable of gaining the support of the people and authorities to combat environmental degradatation. In Cotacachi, Ecuador, a social movement used a combination of education, direct action, the influence of local public authorities and denunciation of the mining company's plans in its own country, Canada, and the support of international environmental groups to influence mining activity.\nFisher cites cases in which multiple strategies were used to effect change. She describes civil society groups that pressure international institutions and also organize local events. Local groups can take responsibility for environmental governance in place of governments.\nAccording to Bengoa, \u201csocial movements have contributed decisively to the creation of an institutional platform wherein the fight against poverty and exclusion has become an inescapable benchmark.\u201d But despite successes in this area, \u201cthese institutional changes have not produced the processes for transformation that could have made substantial changes to the opportunities available to rural inhabitants, particularly the poorest and those excluded from society.\u201d He cites several reasons:\nA successful initiative in Ecuador involved the establishment of stakeholder federations and management committees (NGOs, communities, municipalities and the ministry) for the management of a protected forest.\nThe  proposed an agenda for global governance. These objectives are:\nDespite the increase in efforts, actors, agreements and treaties, the global environment continue to degrade at a rapid rate. From the big hole in Earth's ozone layer to over-fishing to the uncertainties of climate change, the world is confronted by several intrinsically global challenges. However, as the environmental agenda becomes more complicated and extensive, the current system has proven ineffective in addressing and tackling problems related to trans-boundary externalities and the environment is still experiencing degradation at unprecedented levels.\nInforesources identifies four major obstacles to global environmental governance, and describes measures in response. The four obstacles are:\nRecommended measures:\nContemporary debates surrounding global environmental governance have converged on the idea of developing a stronger and more effective institutional framework. The views on how to achieve this, however, still hotly debated. Currently, rather than teaming up with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), international environmental responsibilities have been spread across many different agencies including: a) specialised agencies within the UN system such as the World Meteorological Organisation, the International Maritime Organisation and others; b) the programs in the UN system such as the UN Development Program; c) the UN regional economic and social commission; d) the Bretton Woods institutions; e) the World Trade Organisation and; f) the environmentally focused mechanisms such as the Global Environment Facility and close to 500 international environmental agreements.\nSome analysts also argue that multiple institutions and some degree of overlap and duplication in policies is necessary to ensure maximum output from the system. Others, however, claim that institutions have become too dispersed and lacking in coordination which can be damaging to their effectiveness in global environmental governance. Whilst there are various arguments for and against a WEO, the key challenge, however, remains the same: how to develop a rational and effective framework that will protect the global environment efficiently.\nStarting in 2002, Saward and others began to view the  process as capable opening up the possibility of stakeholder democracy. The summits were deliberative rather than simply participative, with NGOs, women, men, indigenous peoples and businesses joining the decision-making process alongside states and international organizations, characterized by:\nAs of 2013, the absence of joint rules for composing such fora leads to the development of non-transparent relations that favour the more powerful stakeholders. Criticisms assert that they act more as a lobbying platform, wherein specific interest groups attempt to influence governments.\nActors inside and outside the United Nations are discussing possibilities for global environmental governance that provides a solution to current problems of fragility, coordination and coherence. Deliberation is focusing on the goal of making UNEP more efficient. A 2005 resolution recognizes \u201cthe need for more efficient environmental activities in the United Nations system, with enhanced coordination, improved policy advice and guidance, strengthened scientific knowledge, assessment and cooperation, better treaty compliance, while respecting the legal autonomy of the treaties, and better integration of environmental activities in the broader sustainable development framework.\u201d\nProposals include:\nOne of the main studies addressing this issue proposes:\nA 2001 Alliance 21 report proposes six fields of action:\nIndividuals can modify consumption, based on : changes in purchasing habits, simplified lifestyles (less work, less consumption, more socialization and constructive leisure time). But individual actions must not replace vigilance and pressure on policies. Notions of responsible consumption developed over decades, revealing the political nature of individual purchases, according to the principle that consumption should satisfy the population's basic needs. These needs comprise the physical wellbeing of individuals and society, a healthy diet, access to drinking water and plumbing, education, healthcare and physical safety. The general attitude centres on the need to reduce consumption and reuse and recycle materials. In the case of food consumption, local, organic and fair trade products which avoid ill treatment of animals has become a major trend.\nAlternatives to the personal automobile are increasing, including public transport, car sharing and bicycles and alternative propulsion systems.\nAlternative energy sources are becoming less costly.\nEcological industrial processes turn the waste from one industry into raw materials for another.\nGovernments can reduce subsidies/increase taxes/tighten regulation on unsustainable activities.\nThe  encourages holistic approaches to environmental and economic challenges, incorporating indigenous knowledge. ,  capped population growth based on the carrying capacity of the Sheep River.

Which is why the concept of \u2018collective security\u2019 has arisen.\u201d\nMoving local decisions to the global level is as important as the way in which local initiatives and best practices are part of a global system.

WtE is a form of . Most WtE processes generate electricity and/or heat directly through combustion, or produce a combustible fuel commodity, such as , , . or .\nThe first  or \"Destructor\" was built in  UK in 1874 by  to the design of Alfred Fryer.\nThe first US incinerator was built in 1885 on  in .\nThe first waste incinerator in  was built in 1903 in .\nThe first facility in the  was built in 1905 in .\nGasification and pyrolysis processes have been known and used for centuries and for coal  as  early  as the 18th century.... Development technologies for processing [residual solid mixed waste] has only become a focus of  attention in recent years stimulated by the search for more efficient energy recovery. (2004) Incineration, the combustion of organic material such as waste with energy recovery, is the most common WtE implementation. All new WtE plants in  countries incinerating waste (residual , commercial, industrial or ) must meet strict emission standards, including those on  (NO),  (SO),  and . Hence, modern incineration plants are vastly different from old types, some of which neither recovered energy nor materials. Modern incinerators reduce the volume of the original waste by 95-96 percent, depending upon composition and degree of recovery of materials such as metals from the ash for recycling.\nIncinerators may emit fine , heavy metals, trace dioxin and , even though these emissions are relatively low from modern incinerators. Other concerns include proper management of residues: toxic , which must be handled in hazardous waste disposal installation as well as  (IBA), which must be reused properly.\nCritics argue that incinerators destroy valuable resources and they may reduce incentives for recycling. The question, however, is an open one, as European countries which recycle the most (up to 70%) also incinerate to avoid .\nIncinerators have electric efficiencies of 14-28%. In order to avoid losing the rest of the energy, it can be used for e.g.  (). The total efficiencies of cogeneration incinerators are typically higher than 80% (based on the  of the waste).\nThe method of incineration to convert municipal solid waste (MSW) is a relatively old method of WtE generation. Incineration generally entails burning waste (residual MSW, commercial, industrial and RDF) to boil water which powers  that generate electric energy and heat to be used in homes, businesses, institutions and industries. One problem associated is the potential for pollutants to enter the atmosphere with the flue gases from the boiler.  These pollutants can be acidic and in the 1980s were reported to cause environmental degradation by turning rain into .  Modern incinerators incorporate carefully engineered primary and secondary burn chambers, and controlled burners designed to burn completely with the lowest possible emissions, eliminating, in some cases, the need for  and electro-static precipitators on smokestacks.\nBy passing the smoke through the basic lime scrubbers, any acids that might be in the smoke are neutralized which prevents the acid from reaching the atmosphere and hurting the environment. Many other devices, such as fabric filters, reactors, and catalysts destroy or capture other regulated pollutants. According to the New York Times, modern incineration plants are so clean that \"many times more dioxin is now released from home fireplaces and backyard barbecues than from incineration. \" According to the German Environmental Ministry, \"because of stringent regulations, waste incineration plants are no longer significant in terms of emissions of dioxins, dust, and heavy metals\".\nThere are a number of other new and emerging technologies that are able to produce energy from waste and other fuels without direct combustion. Many of these technologies have the potential to produce more electric power from the same amount of fuel than would be possible by direct combustion. This is mainly due to the separation of corrosive components (ash) from the converted fuel, thereby allowing higher combustion temperatures in e.g. , , , . Some are able to efficiently convert the energy into  or gaseous fuels:\n: \nNon-thermal technologies: \nDuring the 2001\u20132007 period, the waste-to-energy capacity increased by about four million metric tons per year.\nJapan and China each built several plants based on direct smelting or on  of solid waste. \nIn China there are about 434 waste-to-energy plants in early 2016. \nJapan is the largest user in thermal treatment of municipal solid waste in the world, with 40 million tons.\nSome of the newest plants use stoker technology and others use the advanced oxygen enrichment technology. \nSeveral treatment plants exist worldwide using relatively novel processes such as direct smelting, the Ebara fluidization process and the Thermoselect JFE gasification and melting technology process.\nAs of June 2014, Indonesia had a total of 93.5 MW installed capacity of waste-to-energy, with a pipeline of projects in different preparation phases together amounting to another 373MW of capacity.\nBiofuel Energy Corporation of Denver, CO, opened two new  plants in , and , in July 2008. \nThese plants use distillation to make ethanol for use in motor vehicles and other engines.  Both plants are currently reported to be working at over 90% capacity. \nFulcrum BioEnergy incorporated located in , is building a WtE plant near .  The plant is scheduled to open in 2019 under the name of Sierra BioFuels plant.  BioEnergy incorporated predicts that the plant will produce approximately 10.5 million gallons per year of ethanol from nearly 200,000 tons per year of MSW.\nWaste to energy technology includes , which can take  and create , using waste  or organic material. In the fermentation process, the sugar in the waste is converted to carbon dioxide and alcohol, in the same general process that is used to make wine. Normally fermentation occurs with no air present. \n can also be done using waste to energy technologies, and the result of this process is biodiesel. The cost effectiveness of esterification will depend on the feedstock being used, and all the other relevant factors such as transportation distance, amount of oil present in the feedstock, and others.\nGasification and pyrolysis by now can reach gross thermal conversion efficiencies (fuel to gas) up to 75%, however a complete combustion is superior in terms of fuel conversion efficiency. Some pyrolysis processes need an outside heat source which may be supplied by the gasification process, making the combined process self-sustaining.\nIn thermal WtE technologies, nearly all of the carbon content in the waste is emitted as  () to the atmosphere (when including final combustion of the products from pyrolysis and gasification; except when producing bio-char for fertilizer).  (MSW) contain approximately the same mass fraction of carbon as  itself (27%), so treatment of 1 metric ton (1.1 short tons) of MSW produce approximately 1 metric ton (1.1 short tons) of .\nIn the event that the waste was , 1 metric ton (1.1 short tons) of MSW would produce approximately 62 cubic metres (2,200\u00a0cu\u00a0ft)  via the  decomposition of the  part of the waste. This amount of methane has more than twice the  than the 1 metric ton (1.1 short tons) of , which would have been produced by combustion. In some countries, large amounts of  are collected, but still the global warming potential of the landfill gas emitted to atmosphere in e.g. the US in 1999 was approximately 32% higher than the amount of  that would have been emitted by combustion.\nIn addition, nearly all biodegradable waste is . That is, it has biological origin. This material has been formed by plants using atmospheric  typically within the last growing season. If these plants are regrown the  emitted from their combustion will be taken out from the atmosphere once more.\nSuch considerations are the main reason why several countries administrate WtE of the biomass part of waste as . The rest\u2014mainly plastics and other oil and gas derived products\u2014is generally treated as .\nMSW to a large extent is of biological origin (biogenic), e.g. paper, cardboard, wood, cloth, food scraps. Typically half of the energy content in MSW is from biogenic material. Consequently, this energy is often recognised as renewable energy according to the waste input.\nSeveral methods have been developed by the European CEN 343 working group to determine the biomass fraction of waste fuels, such as /Solid Recovered Fuel. The initial two methods developed (CEN/TS 15440) were the  and the . A detailed systematic comparison of these two methods was published in 2010. Since each method suffered from limitations in properly characterizing the biomass fraction, two alternative methods have been developed.\nThe first method uses the principles of . A technical review (CEN/TR 15591:2007) outlining the carbon 14 method was published in 2007. A technical standard of the carbon dating method (CEN/TS 15747:2008) is published in 2008. In the United States, there is already an equivalent carbon 14 method under the standard method ASTM D6866.\nThe second method (so-called ) employs existing data on materials composition and operating conditions of the WtE plant and calculates the most probable result based on a mathematical-statistical model. Currently the balance method is installed at three Austrian and eight Danish incinerators.\nA comparison between both methods carried out at three full-scale incinerators in Switzerland showed that both methods came to the same results.\nCarbon 14 dating can determine with precision the biomass fraction of waste, and also determine the biomass calorific value. Determining the calorific value is important for green certificate programs such as the Renewable Obligation Certificate program in the United Kingdom. These programs award certificates based on the energy produced from biomass. Several research papers, including the one commissioned by the  in the UK, have been published that demonstrate how the carbon 14 result can be used to calculate the biomass calorific value. The UK gas and electricity markets authority, , released a statement in 2011 accepting the use of Carbon 14 as a way to determine the biomass energy content of waste feedstock under their administration of the Renewables Obligation. Their Fuel Measurement and Sampling (FMS) questionnaire describes the information they look for when considering such proposals.\nAccording to the  (ISWA) there are 431 WtE plants in Europe (2005) and 89 in the United States (2004). The following are some examples of WtE plants.\nA single plant is currently under construction:\nThe US Air Force once tested a Transportable Plasma Waste to Energy System (TPWES) facility (PyroGenesis technology) at Hurlburt Field, Florida. The plant, which cost $7.4 million to construct, was closed and sold at a government liquidation auction in May 2013, less than three years after its commissioning.  The opening bid was $25.  The winning bid was sealed.\nBesides large plants, domestic waste-to-energy incinerators also exist. For example, the Refuge de Sarenne has a domestic waste-to-energy plant. It is made by combining a wood-fired gasification boiler with a .\n"},

Waste laws are generally designed to minimize or eliminate the uncontrolled dispersal of waste materials into the environment in a manner that may cause ecological or biological harm, and include laws designed to reduce the generation of waste and promote or mandate waste recycling. Regulatory efforts include identifying and categorizing waste types and mandating transport, treatment, storage, and disposal practices.\nWaste determination is the process by which a particular material is classified as a \"waste\"  subject to regulation. The question can become quite complicated, as for example determining whether a some material is \"hazardous waste\" under the U.S. \nDetermination of whether a material constitutes a particular waste type may govern the manner in which the material must be handled from that point forward. For example, in the United States, non-hazardous  may be sent to a landfill, while used motor oil is deemed hazardous and cannot be dumped in landfills, but rather is subject to more stringent handling, storage, treatment, and disposal requirements.\n may have their own individual definitions and unique handling requirements. In each case a \"waste stream\" may be identified - waste is generated when a previously useful item is discarded or abandoned, and then may flow through various defined treatment, recycling, and storage areas before arriving at a final designated disposal site.\nDisposal standards govern the permissibility, method, and location of disposal of a particular waste. Such standards may be designed to protect human health and comfort, and environmental values. A variety of methods exist to control disposal.\nWaste disposal may be restricted entirely via a disposal ban. The most common and widespread such standard is a prohibition on . Where a jurisdiction has authorized a specific place or system for trash collection, deposition or abandonment of trash elsewhere may be subject to civil or criminal penalties. Other more specific disposal bans - from mandating that paint not be poured down drains, to specifying national repositories for radioactive waste - all act to govern the final resting place of various wastes. Still other wastes may be required to be separated for recycling, rather than disposal. All of these prohibitions are, in a sense, conditional, in that they do not outright ban the disposal of the material, but rather restrict the disposal location.\nWaste disposal also may be restricted conditionally by requiring that a waste be treated in a specific fashion before it may be disposed of at a particular location. One such program is the 's Land Disposal Restrictions under the  Subtitle C hazardous waste management program. These rules restrict the land disposal (placement in , primarily) of hazardous waste without prior approved programs. The \"disposal prohibition\" mandates that hazardous waste cannot be disposed on land until it is treated to meet specified characteristics (acceptable ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity, and toxicity), or is treated by specified approved treatment methods. The \"dilution prohibition\" proscribes adding large amounts of water, soil, or non-hazardous waste in order to avoid specified treatment. The \"storage prohibition\" allows waste to be stored only for the purposes of accumulating for treatment, rather than simply stored indefinitely to avoid treatment.\nSpecific standards may also be adopted regarding the construction and operation of waste disposal facilities. , for example, may be required to meet location restrictions to avoid geological faults or wetlands; to install liner systems and collection systems to minimize groundwater contamination from leachate; to adopt operation policies that minimize dust and other nuisances; to install methane removal or collection systems to eliminate ; to be covered and otherwise closed upon decommissioning; and to operate environmental monitoring systems to ensure compliance.\n includes agreements related to international transport and disposal of hazardous waste:\n\n\nUK waste legislation is derived predominantly from EU governance and transposed into UK law via Statutory Instruments.\nUK waste management facilities register for one or some of 28 standard permits, may opt for an exemption from licensing or complete a bespoke permit.  Persons or organisations wishing to transport waste (other than their own) must purchase a waste carrier license.  Producers of hazardous wastes are required (where they produce in excess of 500 kilograms per annum) to register as a hazardous waste producer.\nRegulatory bodies include:\nIn addition to laws implementing or advancing portions of the US laws, some US states have enacted notable laws on other waste and environmental subjects.\n"},
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_minimisation", "title": "WasteminimisationWikipedia", "body": "\n is a set of processes and practices intended to reduce the amount of  produced.  By reducing or eliminating the generation of harmful and persistent wastes, waste minimisation supports efforts to promote a more  society. Waste minimisation involves redesigning products and processes and/or changing societal patterns of  and production.\nThe most environmentally resourceful, , and  way to manage waste often is to not have to address the problem in the first place. Managers see waste minimisation as a primary focus for most  strategies. Proper waste treatment and disposal can require a significant amount of time and resources; therefore, the benefits of waste minimisation can be considerable if carried out in an effective, safe and sustainable manner.\nTraditional waste management focuses on processing waste after it is created, concentrating on , ,  and  conversion. Waste minimisation involves efforts to avoid creating the waste during manufacturing.  To effectively implement waste minimisation the manager requires knowledge of the production process,  (the tracking of materials from their extraction to their return to earth) and details of the composition of the waste.\nThe main sources of waste . In the , most waste comes from the construction and  of buildings, followed by  and quarrying, industry and commerce. Household waste constitutes a relatively small proportion of all waste.  Industrial waste is often tied to requirements in the .  For example, a company handling a product may insist that it should be shipped using particular packing because it fits downstream needs.\nWaste minimisation can  and often turns out to have positive economic benefits.  Waste minimisation can improve:\nIn , using more efficient manufacturing processes and better materials generally reduces the production of waste. The application of waste minimisation techniques has led to the development of innovative and commercially successful replacement products.\nWaste minimisation efforts often require investment, which is usually compensated by the savings. However, waste reduction in one part of the production process may create waste production in another part.\nWaste minimisation and resource maximisation for  can most easily be done at the design stage. Reducing the number of  used in a product or making the product easier to take apart can make it easier to be repaired or recycled at the end of its useful life.\nIn some cases, it may be best not to minimise the volume of  used to make a product, but instead reduce the volume or  of the waste created at the end of a product's life, or the environmental impact of the product's use.  (See section ).\nIn this strategy, products and  are optimally designed to meet their intended use.  This applies especially to , which should only be as durable as necessary to serve their intended purpose. On the other hand, it could be more wasteful if food, which has consumed resources and energy in its production, is damaged and spoiled because of extreme measures to reduce the use of , ,  and  in its packaging.\nImproving , such as extending a 's useful life to 15 years instead of 12, can reduce waste and usually much improves resource optimisation.\nBut in some cases it has a negative .  If a product is too durable, its replacement with more efficient technology is likely to be delayed. Therefore, extending an older machine's useful life may place a heavier burden on the environment than scrapping it, recycling its metal and buying a new model.  Similarly, older vehicles consume more fuel and produce more emissions than their modern counterparts.\nMost proponents of waste minimisation consider that the way forward may be to view any manufactured product at the end of its useful life as a resource for recycling and reuse rather than waste.\nMaking refillable glass  strong enough to withstand several journeys between the  and the  requires making them thicker and so heavier, which increases the resources required to transport them. Since transport has a large environmental impact, careful evaluation is required of the number of return journeys bottles make.  If a refillable bottle is thrown away after being refilled only several times, the resources wasted may be greater than if the bottle had been designed for a single journey..\nMany choices involve trade-offs of environmental impact, and often there is insufficient information to make informed decisions.\nVarious aspects of business practices affect waste, such as the use of  in restaurants.\n are a visible form of re-use, and some stores offer a \"bag credit\" for re-usable shopping bags, although at least  reversed its policy, claiming \"it was just a temporary bonus\".  In contrast, one study suggests that a bag tax is a more effective incentive than a similar discount.  (Of note, the before/after study compared a circumstance in which some stores offered a discount vs. a circumstance in which all stores applying the tax.)  While there is a minor inconvenience involved, this may remedy itself, as reusable bags are generally more convenient for carrying groceries.\nThis section details some waste minimisation techniques for .\nAppropriate amounts and sizes can be chosen when purchasing goods; buying large containers of paint for a small decorating job or buying larger amounts of food than can be consumed create unnecessary waste. Also, if a pack or  is to be thrown away, any remaining contents must be removed before the container can be recycled.\nHome , the practice of turning kitchen and garden waste into compost can be considered waste minimisation.\nThe resources that households use can be reduced considerably by  thoughtfully (e.g. turning off lights and equipment when it is not needed) and by reducing the number of car journeys made. Individuals can reduce the amount of waste they create by buying fewer products and by buying products which last longer. Mending broken or worn items of clothing or equipment also contributes to minimising household waste. Individuals can minimise their water usage, and walk or cycle to their destination rather than using their car to save fuel and cut down emissions.\nIn a domestic situation, the potential for minimisation is often dictated by .  Some people may view it as wasteful to purchase new products solely to follow  when the older products are still usable.  Adults working full-time have little free time, and so may have to purchase more  that require little preparation, or prefer disposable nappies if there is a baby in the family.\nThe amount of waste an individual produces is a small portion of all waste produced by society, and personal waste reduction can only make a small impact on overall waste volumes.  Yet, influence on policy can be exerted in other areas. Increased consumer awareness of the impact and power of certain purchasing decisions allows industry and individuals to change the total .  Consumers can influence manufacturers and distributors by avoiding buying products that do not have , which is currently not mandatory, or choosing products that minimise the use of packaging. In the ,  combines both  and  packaging , in a  packaging  classification system to minimise waste. Where reuse schemes are available, consumers can be proactive and use them.\n establishments are massive producers of waste. The major sources of healthcare waste are:  hospitals, laboratories and research centres, mortuary and autopsy centres, animal research and testing laboratories, blood banks and collection services, and nursing homes for the elderly.\nWaste minimisation can offer many opportunities to these establishments to use fewer resources, be less wasteful and generate less hazardous waste.  Good management and control practices among health-care facilities can have a significant effect on the reduction of waste generated each day.\nThere are many examples of more efficient practices that can encourage waste minimization in healthcare establishments and research facilities\n\n\n\n"},

End-uses from land recycling may include: mixed-use, residential, commercial, or industrial developments; and/or  such as  used by , ; or larger  such as .\nSince many abandoned and underutilized properties lie within economically distressed and disadvantaged communities, land recycling often benefits and stimulates re-investment in historically under-served areas. The real or perceived presence of   from historical previous uses or  , causing  and , may complicate the redevelopment of such properties. Such environmentally distressed properties, with site cleanup and mitigation considerations, are commonly referred to as .\nThe most common form of land recycling is the redevelopment of abandoned or unused building properties. Adaptive building is the development of an old abandoned building to repurpose it into a new building design and/or new purpose. Saving the old buildings and reusing the materials within the buildings is considered  more environmentally sustainable than building all new structure with new materials. This repurposing of materials in the existing adaption or to a different building site could include wood, metals, roofing, brick, etc. and would provide products for new projects to prevent excessive waste. Site disruptions are also decreased due to less destruction and building. The adaptive process also provides a more sustainable way to promote environmentally friendly infrastructure. It also reduces the amount of pollutants that can contaminate the soil and water around the abandoned building. This can be particularly beneficial when repurposing buildings which are near schools, residential neighborhoods, or other workplaces by mitigating occupational hazards from such contaminants commonly found in construction. This is also thought of to be more economic friendly, including direct and indirect cost savings to the construction company and to the building owner. The cost of producing new materials and the services that come with manufacturing these products are much more costly thanrepurposing existing buildings. \nThe  classifies a  as \"A brownfield is a property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant.\" Currently in the United States there are more than 450,000 brownfields, which when improved have been shown to improve the surrounding environmental stress. Funding for these hazardous sites may be obtained through the EPA's Brownfields and Land Revitalization Program which empowers municipalities, landholders, and land developers to safely clean up and repurpose the land. \nLand Recycling can also include those spaces that are not within urbanized environments are involve a building. Agricultural reuse is a very important part of land reuse where an existing field might have been abandoned due to nutrient depletion, and can be developed into something else. In addition to this the redevelopment of underutilized land into parks, community gardens and open space reservoirs are also prominent.\nThe social, economic, environmental, and other benefits of land recycling include:\nThe  estimates that there are over 450,000 brownfields and almost 15\u00a0million acres (61,000\u00a0km) of potentially contaminated properties across the United States. These sites sit idle and neglected, serving as desolate and unattractive spaces within their communities. By putting these barren infill sites to use, land recycling revitalizes communities, promotes , and preserves precious resources. \nLand recycling helps clean up and revitalize inner cities by returning abandoned, idle, or underused sites to productive use, bolstering , creating jobs and boosting local tax-revenues.\nThe re-use of land revitalizes communities and renews economic activity, particularly in under-served urban areas. Abandoned, idled, and vacant properties often lie in former industrial and commercial areas, typically in urban and historically disadvantaged areas. These sites can be community eyesores, negatively impacting social and economic development, and often human and . The failure to redevelop brownfields in particular translates into potentially more exposure to toxins and the loss of economic and housing benefits that can come from appropriate redevelopment.\nBy putting these properties to new and productive use, land recycling encourages growth of  and services in such areas, helping to break up concentrations of , creating jobs, and stimulating additional private investment and local tax-revenue. An abandoned, well-situated, factory site can be cleaned up and redeveloped into a much-needed mixed-use development with a grocery store, senior housing, and access to public transportation. The addition of neighborhood-serving retail, affordable housing, or a clean public park in a disadvantaged community can boost local spirit and improve overall quality of life.\nLand recycling increases density in urban areas, by reducing  and unplanned, low-density, -dependent developments.\nSprawl development scatters housing, public transit, jobs and other amenities farther apart, demanding more frequent use of cars for travel. The increase in vehicle-miles traveled (VMTs) produces a range of health and environmental problems, including air pollution and increased greenhouse gas emissions, and increased incidence of traffic jams and asthma. This results in a lower quality of life for residents, ever-increasing commute times, and the health implications of smog.\nBy moving new jobs, economic opportunities and community amenities farther from established populations, sprawl development can cripple once-thriving cities. This trend takes a toll on the socio-economic health of urban communities as growth retreats from the urban center.\nRather than take advantage of existing infrastructure such as roads, public transit, and public works, building sprawl projects abandons these resources and demands further consumption of land and resources.\nLand recycling offers an intelligent alternative to sprawl development. It reuses vital infrastructure and public resources and creates compact, full-service neighborhoods that reduce vehicle use and carbon dependence. Rebuilding in urban neighborhoods generates reinvestment in vibrant economic and cultural centers, rather than drawing away much-needed resources. Compact, urban development through land recycling is essential to sustainable development and is key to managing rapid population growth across the United States and beyond. As daily commute times decrease, the general quality of life improves as residents have more time to enjoy the world around them.\nRedirecting population growth and growth of businesses to already urbanized areas is integral to fostering sustainable communities. Applying sustainable principles to land use and growth management requires that growth be redirected from scattered fringe areas back to our urban cores, where people, services and infrastructure already exist. Building up our urban areas positively increases population density, providing the critical mass to support local services from coffee shops to grocery stores, public transit to libraries and symphony halls. Land recycling provides opportunities for urban renewal and to build truly livable communities: efficient, compact, vibrant urban neighborhoods integrated with public transit systems, which offer a mix of uses as well as affordable housing.\nLand recycling effectively curbs  emissions by encouraging smart, compact growth that reduces . Redevelopment within an urban core reduces commuting distances and therefore average vehicle miles traveled (VMTs) by creating residential, office, and other amenities within close proximity. Since transportation alone accounts for a third of greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted in the United States, land recycling offers a key tool in any fight against climate change. A recent Urban Land Institute study found that compact urban developments reduce the number of vehicle miles traveled (VMTs) by 20 to 40 percent  because users are closer to amenities and can more easily rely on public transportation. Smart urban planning is therefore crucial to maximizing energy savings and overall reduction of greenhouse gases.\nAs of 2009 the green movement has started to emphasize the  (LEED) Green Building Rating System, a certification system that rewards the design, construction and operation of high-performance green buildings. LEED certification signifies incorporation of smart building design and technology to reduce energy use and minimize waste. However, even if a building is energy-efficient, the energy required to travel to and from a LEED certified site may well exceed the energy saved through energy-efficient features. LEED certified buildings and other developments best benefit climate change when they reuse infill sites and access existing resources.\nLEED Certification can also benefit the occupant of the reused building. As sustainability becomes more prioritized within the building movement, having a LEED certified building becomes more desirable This certification may persuade public opinion and encourage more of the population to seek services by a company that prioritizes sustainability  . In addition to this, some governmental bodies provide monetary benefits for prioritizing a sustainable cite such as tax breaks and stipends.\n involves meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\nBy encouraging the recycling rather than the consumption of land, land recycling promotes  and responsible, sustainable patterns of development. A 2001 study by George Washington University shows that for every acre of brownfield redeveloped, 4.5 acres (18,000\u00a0m) of undeveloped land is conserved.\n . As most brownfields and other abandoned sites are typically situated in urban areas, they tap into existing nearby infrastructure, limiting the need to build new roads, gridlines, and amenities, thereby reducing further land consumption. Each infill development prevents sprawl into open space, forests and agricultural land, preserving acres of undeveloped land.\nLand development is an aspect of land recycling which involves urbanization and development of land, by reusing previously abandoned and unused land in commercial areas of larger cities. Sustainable Remediation is an aspect of land development where there is an increased focus the costs and benefits of certain aspects of land recycling. It aims to look at land remediation holistically considering not just the current environmental implications but also the long term social and economic implications. Co-design, is much more intentional and focuses on a multitude solutions by completing cost-benefit analyses, engaging in more inclusive conversations with stakeholders along with environmental impacts like energy and resources which may be consumed during land recycling projects. The Society of American Military Engineers have focused on using policy implemented by the American department of defense to ensure more sustainable practices. Looking more specifically some efforts being implemented by the S.A.M.E include composition of a sustainability remediation tool which allows for estimates of specific technologies to be considered when analyzing land remediation. Planning and design for land development and transformation by using co-design has resulted in better shared information on systems. These have worked well on sustainable land development as well as improved communication and handling of barriers, ultimately creating a better integrated program on a global scale.\nIt has been used in cities in Australia as part of global urban research programs to create land remediation solutions. The overall process involves four phases which included co-design which resulted in outcomes for policy and practice, research and knowledge and solution development. In this case, the sustainable remediation framework was created and used to create better co-design processes starting small scale locally and extending out to global scales. The process was split into three components starting with assisting in creating urban goals on each level of the scale which align with world views and influence, the policies which are in place and finally, to local technology and knowledge. Then shifting to look at how the urban goals affect urban systems like finances, environmental, and social capital as well as more physical systems like energy and water. Allowing better understanding of the costs and benefits of different land remediation goals. Then the process then looks more long term and focuses on the outcomes over time to understand the overarching effects of the implemented land remediation goals. Finally, the process looks at the major parts of the framework which need to be improved or need more focus.\nA push for sustainable land remediation can be seen all over the world, when looking at urban planning and can also be connected to large public health scares or changes in social norms. In the UK after cholera outbreaks in the 19th century, people started to pay more attention to the way homes were being built and where they were being built. Now as urbanization has increased, the push is for using land which has already been partially or completely developed and transforming it into something different. The inclusion of garden cities, which are cities built with the intention of avoiding disrupting previously present natural ecosystems. An example is the  which began formulating plans that focused on preservation of natural beauty in the area by avoiding the removal of plant life that was already there and working to build around it. This also spread to other countries in Europe with Germany building its first garden city in 1909 and  in Australia where the main goal was to reestablish and maintain forest cover around the city. Later, Design with Nature written by , influenced a lot of the sustainable development goals which were implemented all over the world. \nIn the US, a city beautification movement started in the early 20th century, many cities were redeveloped as part of the movement but Chicago was the most influenced. As the city was being physical improved they found that there was a need for more focus on development and its social implications. As time went on there were also more conversations about the influence that people have on their environment with more literature about the effects of environmental degradation became more mainstream. This allowed more intersectional land development goals to be implemented when looking at the different needs of people in different countries.\nWhile land recycling has great economic and environmental benefits, without the right tools, skills, and knowledge, reusing land can produce certain challenges.  Obstacles to redevelopment may include lack of funding and increased scrutiny. These can particularly impede projects on brownfields, which carry the stigma of contamination. Because of these concerns, the perceived ease of developing on open land, or , remains alluring to many. Factors that hinder land recycling include:\nAs the saying goes, in  only three things matter: location, location, location. Because idled and underused infill sites are often located in distressed urban areas concerns arise about crime, safety, and access to quality education and services. These and other market factors frequently pull development to open land near traditionally desirable communities and away from urban infill sites.\nBrownfields and infill sites must compete with attractive, undeveloped suburban and rural land, also called . When considering the real or perceived risks and costs of land recycling, a greenfield development may seem more economically sensible as the immediate costs are typically less than developing on an infill or brownfield site. However, it is important to consider the long-term economic gain of land recycling and the added social and environmental rewards of sustainable development.\nAs defined by the , a  site is \u201creal property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant\u201d. In other words, brownfield sites comprise abandoned, idled, or underused industrial and commercial facilities where expansion or redevelopment is complicated by real or perceived environmental contamination.\n \nBrownfield sites are not being repurposed or reused because of the amount of toxins left over from urban industrialization. These sites are can cause serious health risks to a large number of people. Since these sites have a high levels of land contamination, there is a high cost of remediation. Processes to reduce land contamination, either physical or chemical technologies can also cause more infectivity and loss of land function.  is an idea being talked about to produce a more environmental space. Nature-based solutions can be looked at as policies and approaches to environmental issues that are in benefit to human health and biodiversity. These nature-based solutions promote environmentally friendly strategies instead of your regular industrial approaches that have climate hazards. An example would include developing a permeable green area, from these brownfield sites.  is another environmentally friendly approach for brownfield remediation. Phytoremediation programs reduce contaminants in the soil, water and air through planting different types of plants. Important metals that are harmful to human health, such as selenium, zinc, nickel and iron, are removed from contaminated soil through this process. These procedures are inexpensive because the plants rely on sunlight and the recycled nutrients in the ground. Although, phytoremediation cannot be used the same way in every destination due to different types of plants being nurtured differently in different types of environments. It depends on the soil, where the plant is placed, if it is getting enough nutrients to thrive, etc. The plants end up being so greatly polluted from heavy metals that they need to be disposed of. Thermal treatment is used as a disposal option. Thermal treatment implicates the combustion of the waste materials through machines that produce high enough temperatures, which decomposes the organic molecules within the plant. This treatment is typically used in the residential and industrial scale, making it useful for brownfield sites.\nAssessing whether or not a site is contaminated can be a costly process that deters land reuse. Potential purchasers are often unwilling or unable to risk an investment in a site assessment for a property that may require cleanup they cannot afford. Even if a site has been purchased, concerns over cleanup costs may further stall redevelopment. Uncertainty over time, cost or a high price for cleanup leaves many brownfield sites in development limbo.\nObtaining private front-end financing for brownfield cleanup can be a difficult process. Since financing is more readily available for development on greenfields, infill and brownfield sites are often passed over.\nThe concern for contamination of new occupants of a redeveloped brownfield is a concern. Communities of color and low income are disproportionately affected by pollution and brownfield sites offer a higher risk to the communities surrounding them. Many suggest that brownfield programs are a good alternative to the Superfund Act, but the standards of cleanup need to be highly considered in order to avoid future contamination.\nAlthough recent changes in some country's federal laws provide some liability relief to new purchasers of contaminated properties, the law remains very complex and many state laws still have strict liability covering real property. Thus, in many cases, any current or past property owner can potentially be legally and financially liable regardless of who is responsible for contamination. This liability web continues to throw a chill on many brownfield projects even in the presence of regulatory reforms designed to encourage redevelopment. A common belief among many brownfield owners is that it is less risky and cheaper to abandon or \u201cmothball\u201d a facility than to conduct a site assessment that could trigger large cleanup costs and potential liability.\nThe potentially complex process of successfully redeveloping an infill site, particularly a brownfield, can challenge land recycling interest and proposals.  Understanding and complying with federal, state, and local legal and regulatory requirements can be daunting for some property owners and developers. Guidance from legal specialists and environmental cleanup consultants is often needed to design, develop, and guide a project through the process of regulatory requirements and permitting approvals.\nBecause most communities with underutilized buildings are those in poverty, an existing company coming in and investing in reimagining it can raise a concern of . The new building can lead to wealthier people coming in and causing displacement of existing residents. Depending on the building occupancy, such as a new apartment complex charging a higher rent, this can drive for higher priced services to come in and eventually push out existing residents who can no longer afford to live in the area.\nAn in-depth examination of land recycling in different countries shows many different perspectives on implementations of land recycling. The general European focus looked at land use in the  and the importance of reducing new land use as well as reducing addition of impervious surface which disrupts natural ecosystems. Beginning with research, a database maintained by the  is used in the EU to monitor land use changes, its main components are Corine Land Cover (CLC) and Urban Atlas (UA). Each of these has its own indicators for measuring increasing land use and increasing urbanization, for Corine Land Cover the flows of land recycling are split based on previously developed and undeveloped land because they each have different potential to produce green urban infrastructure. For the Urban Atlas database, the focus is the same but more geographically and theme specific accuracy so it used to test more of the land recycling indicators. The indicators were tested in all the countries in Europe from 1990-2002 in three sections, the tests were used to compare projections and determine the meaningfulness of land recycling using data from the CLC and UA datasets. The results of the data analysis showed little to no trends in land recycling and more variation in between the different European countries. The approach of the EU then focused more on the large scale environmental impacts of land recycling by quantification and identification of places where land use could be improved.\nOn a smaller scale, Germany focused on limiting the amount of  specifically for settling and traffic to 30 ha per day starting in 2002 as a part of the National Sustainability Strategy. They also incentivized urban development and improvement by making it easier for contractors to obtain permits to develop urban areas. Studies were done to see the effectiveness of the implementation of this policy by looking at . The city was chosen for its ability to be developed as a mostly rural part of  as well as for its appeal for not only younger families looking for in expensive places to settle but also for companies looking for places to develop. The land development of Stralsund was then monitored from 1992 to 2018, the focus of development started with industrialization of the outskirts of the town, then brownfield transformation and finally, residential development. Cost benefit also played a big role in the conversion of pieces of land which hadn't been in use for a long period of time like, a military property. As development continued, there was also compensation for interference with ecosystems and natural spaces by addition of green spaces and by planting trees. When comparing both the old land use plan and the new land use plan, they found that the cost of the new had the potential to save 55% of costs, but ultimately there wasn't much change between the results of the old and the new land use plans. The application of an accelerated inner urban development plan was neither advantageous nor non-advantageous, for Stralsund, Germany, because of the previous structure of the policy. \u00a0The country of Germany also had goals to reach land degradation neutrality by 2030 by reaching its sustainable development goals specifically based on soil improvement. \nGermany has focused a lot on brownfield development as much of Europe with that including not just contaminated land but also land which was previously developed. The push for target amounts of recycled land stems from status quo influence with other countries development of brownfield mitigation work. In  improvement of land and community quality was done by creating more urban forestry. With increased research of the people\u2019s response to the improved brownfields generally quality of life was improved. Some research shows that the greenspaces though positive needed to be made more useable for improvement of quality of life. Mainly stakeholders have a say in the way greenspace is allocated in Germany, so there is more of a push to ensure policy matches with what is beneficial for the people who would be using greenspaces not just in Germany but in other European countries. \u00a0\u00a0\nIn Pennsylvania a land recycling program was established to promote the voluntary clean up and reuse of contaminated sites. This program was established in 1995 and is also known as the Voluntary Cleanup Program. This program aims to set four main standards, the first is to set structured standards. This allows for public knowledge of the cost of cleaning up a site, and ensures the protection of the present and future use of the site. The second standard is granted liability relief. The third standard promotes transparency by giving specific time frames for clean ups and routine reporting of what is being done on the site. Lastly, the fourth standard for this land recycling program is providing financial assistance for cleanups.\n is in  and is the center of many examples of land recycling and building reuse. Designed by  and  opening in 1964, this was one of the first examples of major land recycling in the United States. Surrounding this square is many buildings and waterfront properties that were originally used for production of local goods as well as transportation through the bay. No longer needed for their original uses, these buildings have been transformed and retrofitted to accommodate the needs of the community and attract tourism.\nThe inclusion of new retail spaces, offices, and residential properties in these existing abandoned buildings not only put to use otherwise empty spaces but also prevent the erection of new structures and therefore use less materials, energy, and land. In addition to this, Ghirardelli Square also shows the change of building use to reflect the needs of the residents. Churches specifically have changed from predominantly Christian to other religious uses or convert into secular uses such as housing and businesses.\nThe Foundation Hotel in  is an  project designed by local firm McIntosh Poris Associates (MPA) with collaboration with Simone Deary Design group. This project actually combined two adjacent buildings that were not in use. The main building was built in 1929 and originally housed the city\u2019s oldest fire department. The additional building was once home to Pontchartrain Wine Cellars. \u00a0In 2013 the fire department moved out and the building was left unoccupied for over a year until bought by Aparium Hotel Group.\nThis project focused on the new needs of the community while still preserving the aesthetic and incorporated  in their work. This is significant because as stated above, gentrification can be a major negative effect during land recycling and the attempt to maintain the existing exterior of the building counteracts this.\n\u2019s  Factory sat in Shaw neighborhood from early 1913 to the mid 1980s in full production. After the company moved out of the space the building was abandoned and vacant for almost 20 years until Douglas Development, founded by , bought it in 1997. The building sat vacant for another 15 years until it was redeveloped and converted it into offices in 2013.\nThis building also pulled on  by minimizing the level of exterior renovation as much as possible while still creating a new use for a space that was highly needed in the community. \u00a0This building is 98,000 square feet and is now  styles offices available to the public.\nOther commonly used terms can relate to or serve as synonyms of land recycling:\n"},

There are millions of waste pickers worldwide, predominantly in , but increasingly in  countries as well.\nForms of waste picking have been practiced since antiquity, but modern traditions of waste picking took root during  in the nineteenth century. Over the past half-century, waste picking has expanded vastly in the developing world due to ,  and the . Many cities only provide solid waste collection.\nMany terms are used to refer to people who salvage recyclables from the waste stream for sale or personal consumption. In English, these terms include , , , , , , , , and ; in Spanish , , , ,  and ; and in Portuguese . A more contemporary term, focusing on the outcome of the professional activity, is \"informal sector recycling\". However, the word \"informal\" can be partly misleading, because in practice a continuum between total informality and proper organization in taxed registered formal activities may be encountered.\nIn 2008, participants of the First World Conference of Waste Pickers chose to use the term \"waste picker\" for English usage to facilitate global communication. The term \u201cscavenger\u201d is also commonly used, but many waste pickers find it demeaning due to the implied comparison with animals.\nA waste picker is different from a  because the waste collected by the latter may be destined for a  or , not necessarily for a recycling facility.\n\"\" generally refers to the practice of  and  activists who reclaim items such as food and clothes from the waste stream as a form of protest against . \u201cWaste picking\u201d generally refers to activity motivated purely by economic need.\nThere is little reliable data about the number and demographics of waste pickers worldwide. Most academic research on waste pickers is qualitative rather than quantitative. Systematic large-scale data collection is difficult due to the profession's informal nature, porous borders, seasonally fluctuating workforce, and widely dispersed and mobile worksites. Also, many researchers are reluctant to produce quantitative data out of fear that it might be used to justify crackdowns on waste picking by authorities. Thus, the large-scale estimates that do exist are mainly extrapolations based on very small original research samples. In his book, \"The World's Scavengers\" (2007), Martin Medina provides a methodological guide to researching waste picking.\nIn 1988, the  estimated that 1\u20132% of the global population subsists by waste picking. A 2010 study estimates that there are 1.5 million waste pickers in India alone. Brazil, the country that collects the most robust official statistics on waste pickers, estimates that nearly a quarter million of its citizens engage in waste picking.\nWaste picker incomes vary vastly by location, form of work, and gender. Some waste pickers live in extreme poverty, but many others earn multiple times their country's minimum wage. Recent studies indicate that waste pickers in , , earn approximately US$3 per day, while waste pickers in Cambodia typically earn $1 per day.\nOfficial statistics in Brazil indicate that men earn more than women, regardless of age. Approximately two thirds of Brazil's waste pickers are men overall, but this proportion jumps to 98% in high income waste picker groups (those earning between 3\u20134 times the ). No women were found in the highest income groups (those earning over 10 times the minimum wage).\nOver the past half century, in-country migration and increased fertility rates have caused the population of cities in the developing world to mushroom. The global population of urban dwellers is expected to double between 1987 and 2015, with 90% of this growth occurring in developing countries.  Much of the new population has settled in urban  and squatter settlements, which have expanded rapidly with no central planning. The  found that nearly one billion people worldwide live in slums, about a third of the world's urban dwellers.\nThe rapid urbanization greatly increased the demand for informal waste collecting services, as cities lacked the infrastructure and resources to collect the totality of wastes generated by their inhabitants. Despite spending 30\u201350% of operation budgets on waste management, developing world cities today collect only 50\u201380% of refuse generated by inhabitants. Residents and businesses often resort to burning garbage or disposing of it in streets, rivers, vacant lots, and . This is a source of air, land, and water pollution that threatens human health and the environment. Informal waste collectors help mitigate this harm by collecting recyclable materials by foot or in pushcarts, tricycles, donkey carts, horse carts, and pickup trucks.\nOn the supply side, urbanization has facilitated the expansion of waste picking by creating a large pool of unemployed and underemployed residents with few alternative means of earning a livelihood. Known as \u201cthe one industry that is always hiring,\u201d waste picking provides a cushion for many who lose their jobs during times of war, crisis, and economic downturn in countries that do not have welfare systems. It is also one of the few work opportunities available to people who lack formal education or job experience.\nThough documentation exists of  and  collectors supplying goods to  and  as early as the 17th century, modern waste picking did not flourish in the US and Europe until the 19th century.  Just as in the developing world, the combination of  and  led to three trends which favored the blossoming of the informal waste collecting industry: increased generation of urban waste, increased demand for raw materials from industry, and increased numbers of urban dwellers in need of livelihoods. In that era, waste pickers were known as wharf rats, tinkers, , , and ragpickers. By the mid-20th century waste picking decreased, as waste management industries were formalized, and welfare states decreased the poor's reliance on informal recycling.\nBeginning in the mid-1990s, however, informal recycling in parts of the United States and Western Europe once again began to mushroom. Two factors fueled the boom: First, the demand for recycling surged due to the increased waste stream, declining room in , new recycling technologies, and the efforts of .  In 1985 only one roadside recycling program existed in the United States. By 1998, there were 9,000 such programs and 12,000 recyclable drop-off centers. Laws were passed in some states making it illegal not to recycle. Second, changes in the political economy including the loss of manufacturing jobs, cutbacks to government employment, and the roll back of the welfare state increased the ranks of the poor, working poor, and homeless\u2014thus there were more people disposed to wastepick as a full-time profession or supplemental job.\nAmerican waste pickers predominantly collect cans, bottles, and cardboard. Many immigrants work as waste pickers because language and documentation barriers limit their opportunities to work elsewhere. Many homeless people also work as waste pickers\u2014some describe it as their only alternative to . Some recyclers use vans to increase their yield while others work on foot with carts. Anecdotal evidence suggests that most American waste pickers are male, as waste picking is widely considered too dirty and strenuous a job for women. During an  of homeless recyclers in ,  Teresa Gowan claims to have met hundreds of male waste pickers, but only four female waste pickers.\nWaste picking offers significant ecological, economic, and social benefits:\nWaste pickers not only generate social benefits, but also potential costs as well. These include:\nThere is a high prevalence of disease among waste pickers due to their exposure to hazardous materials such as fecal matter, paper saturated by toxic materials, bottles and containers with chemical residues, contaminated needles, and  from batteries. A study in  found the average lifespan of a dumpsite waste collector to be 39 years, compared to the national average of 69 years, though a later World Bank study estimated life span to be 53 years. In , Egypt, a 1981 study showed an  of 1/3 among waste pickers (one out of three babies dies before reaching age one).\nAmong the most common types of job-related injuries for waste pickers are back and hand injuries caused by lifting heavy objects with little equipment. In a study of 48 waste pickers in Santo Andr\u00e9, Brazil, almost all workers reported pain in the back, legs, shoulder, arms, and hands. Waste pickers who work in open dumps are exposed to large amounts of toxic fumes, and face other severe threats including being run over by trucks and caught in surface subsidence, trash slides, and fires. On 10 July 2000, several hundred waste pickers were killed by a trash slide from a huge garbage mountain after monsoon rains at an open dump in , .\nMost waste picking activity is illegal or unpermitted, so waste pickers commonly face harassment by police and authorities. Also, there is widespread public scorn against waste pickers due to their poverty and perceived lack of hygiene. Women are subject to greater harassment, particularly sexual harassment due to their low social status and lack of social support. \nOne of the most extreme manifestations of such stigma occurs in , where, since the 1980s, \"\" vigilante groups, sometimes working with police complicity, have killed at least two thousand waste collectors, beggars, and prostitutes\u2014whom they refer to as \"disposables\" (). In 1992, around the peak of this activity, eleven corpses of murdered waste collectors were discovered at a university in . Their organs had been sold for transplants and bodies sold to the medical school for dissection (Medina 2009, 155).\nTraditionally, scholars assumed that informal workers such as waste pickers could not collectively organize due to structural barriers such as lack of legal protection, widely dispersed worksites, porous borders to their profession, a culture of independence and individualism, lack of institutional experience, and lack of money and time to build organizations.  Nonetheless, in recent decades waste pickers across Latin America, Asia, and Africa have begun collectively organizing to win a place within formal recycling systems.\nWaste pickers use many organizational formats including cooperatives, associations, companies, unions, and micro-enterprises. Despite the differences in format, most of these organizations share three primary purposes. First, by pooling capital, establishing microenterprises, and forming partnerships with business and government, waste collectors increase their selling power. Second, by securing uniforms, safety equipment, and work permits, cooperatives increase workplace dignity and safety. And third, by demanding recognition and compensation from the state for their environmental and economic contributions, cooperatives increase members\u2019 political might. These three functions\u2014political influence, workplace dignity and safety, and increased earnings\u2014are mutually reinforcing, like legs on a stool.\nSome waste pickers have created \"women\u2019s only\" organizations, which seek to combat gender-based discrimination at worksites and in communities. A study in Brazil indicates that women are heavily overrepresented even in coed organizations, making up 56% of the membership despite the fact that they represent only a third of the total waste picking population.\nBeginning in the 1990s, waste picker organizations in many parts of the world began uniting into regional, national, and transnational coalitions to increase their political voice and economic leverage. In March 2008, delegates from 30 countries gathered in , Colombia, for the first World Conference (and Third Latin American Conference) of Waste Pickers (WIEGO 2008). One of the key issues discussed was the global trend of privatization and concentration of waste management systems. Normally, privatization is thought of as the handover of government functions to the private sector, but in this case, privatization often means the transference of services formerly provided by informal waste collectors to private firms.  As waste streams have expanded due to increased consumption, the waste management industry is becoming increasingly lucrative. Governments around the world are granting private companies monopolies on waste management systems, meaning that the cooperatives\u2019 survival hinges on building political and economic alliances needed to win contracts\u2014often an uphill battle given authorities\u2019 distrust of waste collectors and the cooperatives\u2019 lack of capital for modern machinery.\nIn 1962, the first known  waste picker's organization, , was created in , Colombia. The Colombian waste pickers movement did not emerge as a veritable political force until 1990, however, when four cooperatives who had been fighting the closure of a landfill united as the Waste Collector's Association of Bogot\u00e1 (ARB). Today the ARB is one of the world's most active and established waste picker organizations. In 2013, the  was awarded to  (representing the ARB) for her contribution to  and  in Colombia. Throughout the 1990s, powerful waste collectors associations began to form in other Latin American countries as well\u2014most notably in Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay.\nIn 2005,  hosted the first meeting of the Latin American Waste Picker Network (LAWPN)\u2014an organization that now represents waste pickers movements from 16 countries. LAWPN has four key functions. First, it facilitates exchanges of knowledge, technology, and strategies between member organizations through regional conventions, country-to-country delegations, telecommunications, and strategic reports. Second, it organizes transnational solidarity to aid in local battles. For example, when waste pickers in , , needed support in a local campaign, member organizations across Latin America issued solidarity statements and pressured their national ambassadors in Uruguay to do the same. Third, LAWPN sends leaders from countries with strong waste picker movements to countries with weak movements in order to promote the development of new leadership and organizations. Fourth, LAWPN organizes global waste picker committees to make appeals for support to transnational governance organizations such as the , the , and the .\nIn , The Movement of Excluded Workers (excluded in the sense that their work is not recognized by the government and they are excluded from receiving rights) is the largest waste pickers organization. It is a social organization, independent from political parties, which brings together more than 2,000  (waste picker) in Capital Federal and the suburbs, specifically in the neighborhoods of  and . After years of sacrifice and struggle, they managed to improve their working conditions. They have established a more  system\u2014they no longer travel by hanging off of trucks, they have obtained a work incentive and uniforms, and lastly they have founded a nursery for 160 children, some of whom worked in the past as cartoneros. However, they still have to advance in designing a social security program that includes all the cartoneros of . Additionally, they have to raise awareness among residents of the city to separate their trash so that they can collect door to door, without having direct contact with wet materials.\n is home to Asia's largest waste picker movement. , a  that exclusively organizes women in the informal economy and has membership of over one million, began organizing waste pickers in the late 1970s. SEWA has created nearly ninety waste pickers cooperatives, which members use to gain collective work contracts and access to credit, training, and markets.  One of Asia's largest waste picker associations is The Alliance of Indian Waste Pickers (AIW), a national network of 35 organizations in 22 cities. The AIW facilitates peers support, advocacy and cross-learning among waste pickers, iterant buyers, and support NGOs.\nAlso in India, the All India Kabari Mazdoor Mahasangh (AIKMM) is locked in a battle with the , which closed a deal with the -based company, Ramky Energy and Environment Ltd to manage the waste, in effect criminalising the work of more than 100,000 unorganised waste pickers that currently sort about 20% of Delhi's garbage. The  project made a video on what they call the Delhi waste war. Waste pickers in  have also organized, including the .\nIn Delhi, the NGO Chintan Environmental Research and Action Group makes the work of waste pickers safer (by providing gloves and mouth masks) and it also provides for a steady source of income (by paying a monthly wage to the waste pickers).\nAn Indian waste pickers union known as KKPKP recently carried out a mapping initiative to identify organizations of or that work with waste pickers across the continent\u2014a first step towards the development an Asian network. Several NGOs and trade unions that work with waste pickers, as well as loosely formed groups of waste pickers, were identified in Cambodia, Indonesia, The Philippines, and Thailand.\nIn Bangladesh, Grambangla Unnayan Committee is working with the waste picker community at Matuail Waste Dumpsite of . A daycare centre and a non-formal primary school has been established for the child waste pickers where 112 child waste pickers are given early childhood care and education. Women waste pickers of Matuail has formed a Waste Pickers' cooperative.\nIn Pune (India) there are a worker cooperative of Waste Pickers, called SWaCH. SWaCH is an acronym for Solid Waste Collection Handling that also means clean, in the local language. This initiative empower all members. They all work, they're not merely shareholders. Among the workers, in most age groups, women constitute a bigger group than men, with a total of 78%. However, men are the majority in the youngest age group. Before joining SWaCH, most members used to work as waste pickers or itinerant waste buyers. There's also another group that is constituted by former housekeeping and cleaning workers. The predominant group of SWaCH belongs to the Scheduled Caste, although other Backward Castes, as well as the middle castes, are also represented in SWaCH.  This initiative is a result of Inclusive cities project that has the objective of integrating Waste Pickers into Municipal Solid Waste Management in Pune (India).\n has of the world's most well-established and robust informal recycling systems.

The word \"freegan\" is a  of \"free\" and \"\". While some vegans avoid buying animal products as an act of protest against animal exploitation, freegans\u2014at least in theory\u2014avoid buying  as an act of protest against the food system in general.\nFreeganism is often presented as synonymous with \"\" for discarded food, although freegans are distinguished by their association with an  and  ideology and their engagement in a wider range of alternative living strategies, such as voluntary unemployment,  in abandoned buildings, and \"\" in unoccupied city parks.\nFreegans' goal of reduced participation in capitalism and tactics of recovering wasted goods shares elements with the , an   group based in  in  in the 1960s that organized free housing and clinics and gave away . The word \"freegan\" itself was allegedly invented in 1994 by , the co-founder of \u2014an anarchist group that distributes free vegetarian meals as a protest against militarism and as a way of providing \"solidarity not charity\"\u2014to refer to vegans who eat animal products if they find them in a dumpster. McHenry's account is consistent with other published accounts of freeganism that show the word as beginning to be used in the mid-1990s by participants in the  and radical environmental movements.\n The pamphlet \"Why Freegan?\"\u2014written by former  drummer  in Gainesville, Florida in 1999\u2014defines freeganism as \"an anti-consumeristic ethic about eating\" and goes on to describe practices including , plate scraping, , , , employee scams, and  as alternatives to paying for food. The pamphlet also expanded the activities associated with \"freeganism\" with a long section on non-alimentary practices, including , , reusing goods, and using . More than just a set of behaviors, though, the pamphlet presents freeganism as having an overarching political goal: an \"ultimate boycott\" of \"all the corporations, all the stores, all the pesticides, all the land and resources wasted, the  system, the all-oppressive dollar, the wage slavery, the whole burrito\" in favor of \"liv[ing] a full satisfying life...while treading lightly on the earth\".\nThe first organized group of self-described \"freegans\" formed in 2003 as an offshoot of the  nightclub and associated Activism Center in New York City. According to the group freegan.info, \"After years of trying to boycott products from unethical corporations responsible for human rights violations, environmental destruction, and animal abuse, many of us found that no matter what we bought we ended up supporting something deplorable. We came to realize that the problem isn\u2019t just a few bad corporations but the entire system itself.\" From 2005, freegan.info organized regular events including sewing and bicycle workshops, wild food foraging expeditions, and \"trash tours\"\u2014public dumpster dives open to the public and to media. Other self-described freegan groups have, at one time or another, existed in United Kingdom, Sweden, Norway, Austria, France, Canada, Greece, Poland, Spain, Switzerland, South Korea, Japan, and Brazil, as well as a half-dozen U.S. cities. The majority of these groups are now inactive, however, and many people and organizations engaged in freegan activities do not use the label.\nStudies usually find that most people that participate in practices associated with freeganism, dumpster diving for food, do so for economic reasons. Freegans are usually distinguished as being a subset of this population which has an ideological or political motivation for recovering waste or avoiding consumption, although some freegans also say that they do so for amusement, to acquire free goods, or out of religious conviction.\nFreeganism's initial practitioners and forerunners like  were explicitly anti-capitalist, arguing that capitalism is responsible for excessive consumption, the abuse of human laborers and non-human animals, and the waste of resources. Freegans' approach to anti-capitalism is broadly  in orientation: rather than seeking to seize state power, freegans claim to be engaged in \"\", using wasted resources to build a new society \"in the shell of the old\" based on values of \"community, generosity, social concern, freedom, cooperation, and sharing\". Freegan practices in theory reject the  of basic necessities, the imperative of economic growth, and an economy based on money exchange rather than free gifting or sharing. Freegan organizations also often use , popularized by the anti-globalization movement and later visible in anarchist-inspired mobilizations like .\nThe word \"freegan\" originated as a play on the label \"veganism\" and research on freegan.info in New York found that most participants were vegetarian or vegan prior to becoming freegan. In many cases, though, freegans  vegans by arguing that vegans ignore the environmental and labor impacts of the products they buy and corporate ownership of many vegan product lines. \nFreegans' rejection of veganism is often tied to their discovery of , estimated as up to 40% of the food supply in the United States and other Western countries. For many, statistics about the ecological impacts of food waste\u2014up to 12% of global cropland and 23% of global freshwater goes to produce food which is never consumed\u2014serve as justification for a complete rejection of the capitalist food system. Moreover, the presence of food in supermarket dumpsters shows, according to some freegans, that the vegan theory of social change is flawed, because markets do  efficiently translate consumer preferences into changes in production.\nSome freegans associate themselves with \"\" or \",\" the latter of which asserts that human beings should reject not only capitalism but civilization itself. With some exceptions, though, freeganism is a largely urban or suburban phenomenon. Some research suggests that freegans overcome this apparent contradiction by attempting to re-naturalize the city, treating urban waste as a \"natural\" resource and approach dumpster diving as a practice analogous to hunting or gathering.\nFreegans are best known for recovering discarded food from commercial establishments, a practice known as \"dumpster diving\" or \"urban foraging\" in North America, \"\", \" raiding\", or \"skipitarianism\" in the UK, \"skip dipping\" in Australia, \"containern\" in Germany, or \"doing the duck\" in New Zealand. Freegan diets are thus made possible by the range of practices that produce commercial  that is nonetheless still edible, such as conservative , the deliberate overstocking of certain perishable products (like baked goods), or aesthetic criteria for fruits and vegetables. However, dumpster diving is not limited to rummaging for food; freegans report recovering clothing, books, appliances, bicycles, and furniture from commercial dumpsters as well.\nAlthough some freegans are reluctant to share their sites and strategies for \"urban foraging\", others\u2014like those in freegan.info\u2014have organized public events to raise awareness of food waste and recruit other practitioners. These events attracted significant media coverage, particularly between 2005 and 2009, from outlets such as , , and .\nInstead of buying conventionally grown foods, wild foragers find and harvest food and medicinal plants growing in their own communities. Some freegans participate in \"\" or \"\" gardens, with the stated aim of rebuilding community and reclaiming the capacity to grow one's own food. In order to fertilize those guerrilla gardens, food obtained from dumpster diving is sometimes also reused, and some use  instead of ordinary  techniques in order to keep the required infrastructure small and adapted to urban areas. Some rural freegans are also \"homesteaders\" who grow their own food and employ alternative energy sources to provide energy for their homesteads, occasionally living \"\" entirely.\n\n\"Sharing\" is also presented as a common freegan practice, associated with the anarchist idea of a \"\". For example,  recovers food that would otherwise go to waste to serve warm meals on the street to anyone who wants them.  are free social events in which freegans can share goods instead of discarding them, share skills, give presents and eat food. A  is a temporary market where people exchange goods and services outside of a money-based economy. In New York City, freegan.info often distributes recovered food items for free in an ad-hoc manner after trash tours.Freegans also advocate sharing travel resources. Internet-based  or  reduces but does not eliminate use of cars and all the related resources needed to maintain and operate them.  and  facilitate community sharing of , restore found and broken bikes, and teach people how to do their own bicycle repairs. In the process, they aim to build a culture of skill and resource sharing, reuse wasted bikes and bike parts, and create greater access to .\nJust as freegans argue food waste should be recovered and redistributed, many argue that unoccupied buildings are a form of \"waste\" to be reclaimed. Squatting was widespread in Western Europe as well as parts of the United States in the 1980s and 1990s, and activists used squatted buildings not only for housing but also to create community centers, pirate radio stations, or free schools. A widespread crackdown by municipalities closed many squats and legalized the remainder in the 1990s\u2014the moment when freeganism was emerging\u2014and so it is thus difficult to know how many people are involved in this activity. While research with freegans consistently shows that they  squatting, in practice, freegan living situations vary, ranging from trading work for rent to traditional home ownership.\nWorking less is another component of freeganism. Freegans oppose the notion of working for the sole purpose of accumulating material items. They claim that their need to work is reduced by only purchasing the basic necessities and acquiring the remainder for free from the garbage. According to freegans, not working frees up additional time for political action while avoiding tasks they see as sacrificing valuable time to \"take orders from someone else, stress, boredom, monotony, and in many cases risks to physical and psychological well-being\". As with squatting, however, the degree of concordance between freegan ideology and practices is variable. In surveys, self-described freegans vary from reporting working only irregularly, working consistently in social justice organizations, and being employed in more conventional, \"capitalist\" occupations.\nContact with waste is seen as a taboo and socially unacceptable in most developed countries, and freegans are often associated with stigmatized and racialized groups like the homeless or even compared to scavenging \"pest\" animals like raccoons. Some public health officials, like those in New York City, have explicitly discouraged dumpster diving for sanitation reasons and media coverage occasionally focuses on the \"ick\" factor of dumpster diving while (explicitly or implicitly) ignoring its political content. This discourse has been deployed more broadly to discredit anarchist movements by claiming they are unhygienic and thus dangerous. While some freegans argue that dumpster dived food is safe\u2014noting it is usually thrown out because it cannot be profitably sold, not because it is no longer edible\u2014others embrace the \"dirtiness\" of recovered food as a symbolic rejection of capitalist norms. The group freegan.info has made the disgust attached to wasted food part of its messaging, arguing that social disapprobation should instead fall on those who throw out food, rather than those who recover it.\nFreeganism is also critiqued both by other radical movements and by mainstream commentators for the fact that its signature practice\u2014dumpster diving\u2014depends on the capitalist food system that freegans claim to be rejecting. A typical response is that freegan practices are not limited to dumpster diving, but include also actions like guerilla gardening, wild food foraging, or sewing or bike repair \"skill shares\" that are more fully autonomous from the conventional economy.\nAlthough activities like dumpster diving or  are traditionally seen as subsistence strategies for the poor, most research on freegans finds that individuals come from middle-class and upper-class backgrounds and have high levels of education (even if their present lifestyles make them low-income). Freeganism has also been described as racially exclusive, because freegan's voluntary association of waste would seem to confirm a \"globally ubiquitous racial construction\" that people of color are dirty and polluted. As one freegan of color wrote, \"I am extremely embarrassed for people to see me diving, because I can tell that I\u2019m not just me, I\u2019m also a representation of black people in general...I got harassed by security several times while diving on my own campus, until my white friends pop their heads out of the dumpsters.\" In contrast, the portrait of the gender balance of freeganism is more mixed, with some accounts saying groups are majority men and others majority women.\nThe legality of freegan practices of reclaiming wasted food, space, or buildings varies depending on local laws around property, trespassing, and waste removal. In some places, like New York City, freegans dumpster dive publicly; in other locations, urban foraging is a secretive activity. In recent years, there have been arrests of people dumpster diving for political reasons in the United Kingdom, Belgium, and France, although in most locations charges have eventually been dropped. These actions could be seen as part of a broader criminalization of acts of survival\u2014like sleeping in public places, sharing food without a permit, or recovering aluminum cans to re-sell\u2014that has affected freegans as well as affiliated groups like  and the homeless. Freegans report that stores have responded to waste recovery as well, including deliberately destroying products prior to disposing of them, locking dumpsters, or pouring bleach on food to make it inedible. In France, a new national law bans the practice of destroying food in this way.\nMedia coverage of freeganism in the United States peaked around the  in 2007-2009 and dropped off subsequently. More recently, freeganism has been discussed in the context of increasing public interest in . , a prominent food waste campaigner and founder of the organization \"Feedback\" claims that media attention to freeganism was crucial in attracting attention to the problem. Other analyses of the origins of contemporary public policy initiatives around food waste have also concluded that freeganism contributed to new initiatives, like the French law on food waste or the U.S. food waste reduction challenge.\n"},

One pilot facility operated commercially in Wales for approximately six years. However, the core equipment was moved to another location while the original facility was scheduled for retrofit. No further information about the facility's capacity or the equipment movement has been made available via open source release.\nSince that pilot commercial facility stopped operating, the concept of recursive recycling has not met with as much success as  originally anticipated by environmentalists and conservationists. There are a number of companies operating autoclaves with limited success across the globe (the autoclave operating in Anaheim California was de-commissioned in c. late 2007-early 2008) but the full concept of waste treatment using thermal hydrolysis technology has not been fully realized because of several misconceptions in the autoclave and related steam treatment technologies. There is available engineering background to demonstrate successful testing that can be validated in physical production facilities but because of a lack of participation and general knowledge is a closely held secret, the application of technologies to achieve full recursive levels has not been accepted.\nA number of companies are working on technology to support this concept. That may bring about change to conservation and recycling  when associated advances prove out as successful.

Other approaches include taking glass items to bottle banks at supermarkets and composting , making  unnecessary. \nAccording to the latest figures from :\nA 2018 survey by the  studied the publics concerns and thoughts on recycling in the UK:\nCommercial and industrial (C&I) waste makes up a large proportion of the UK's waste.

Furthermore, 52% of C&I waste was reused or recycled, compared to just 42% in 2002/03. This figure is also greater than the household recycling rate. The industrial and service sectors generate roughly equal amounts of waste with similar recycling rates, even though the service sector is economically larger. The reporting of C&I waste statistics has not always met the 's standards, with local councils using different methodologies for their statistics. There has also been no comprehensive survey of C&I waste since 2003.\nThe EU has introduced a number of directives which determine the targets of UK domestic recycling policy:\nThe 1999 Landfill Directive is one of the most important of these, which demands a reduction in the amount of waste being sent to landfill from 11.2 million tonnes in 2010 to 7.46 million tonnes in 2013 \nIn 2010, Defra claimed that the UK would meet its first landfill diversion target, which was 75% on 1995 levels, and that it is \u2018on track\u2019 to meet the next targets in 2013 (50% on 1995 levels) and 2020 (35% on 1995 levels).\nThe EU Waste Framework Directive states that the UK must recycle 50% of household waste by 2020, which includes  and reusing waste. It also stipulates a 70% minimum recycling target for construction and demolition waste by 2020. The British government is highly confident in meeting the 2020 recycling target, but there is a lower level  of certainty with the 2020 Landfill Directive target. There may not be enough time to construct the necessary facilities for organic waste.\nUK recycling policy aims to improve recycling methods and levels across the UK, focusing on glass, paper, plastic and metal cans.\nGlass can be recycled in the form of bottles and jars which are crushed down and then melted. Glass can be recycled infinitely because it does not lose any of its quality. It uses a lot less energy, fewer raw materials and produces less CO2 than manufacturing glass from scratch. The main difficulty with  is the need to remove the unwanted materials that contaminate it and avoiding the mixing of different colours.\nGlass collection points, known as  are very common near , at  and in local neighborhoods in the . Bottle Banks commonly stand beside collection points for other recyclable waste like ,  and . Local, municipal  usually have one central point for all types of waste in which large glass containers are located. There are now over 50,000 bottle banks in the United Kingdom, and 752,000 tons of glass are now recycled annually.\nThe waste recycling industry in the UK cannot consume all of the recycled container glass that will become available over the coming years, mainly due to the colour imbalance between that which is manufactured and that which is consumed. The UK imports much more green glass in the form of  bottles than it uses, leading to a surplus amount for recycling. The resulting surplus of green glass from imported bottles may be exported to producing countries, or used locally in the growing diversity of secondary end uses for recycled glass.\nAll types of waste paper are recyclable, and  requires a lot less energy and fewer raw materials to produce than manufacturing it from scratch. However, paper cannot be recycled indefinitely, and the normal number of times it can be recycled is about six. 12.5 million tonnes of paper and cardboard are used annually in England.\nIn the UK, the amount of post-consumer plastic being recycled is relatively low, due in part to a lack of recycling facilities. The challenge with  lies in sorting differing , often by hand, which slows the process. The  was founded in 2009 by the  with the aim of engaging the British public in a nationwide debate about the use, reuse and disposal of plastics, and hosts a series of debates on its website framed around the waste hierarchy.\nThere is a high recycling rate for metal cans in the UK, with  and steel cans being the most common items. Metal can be recycled indefinitely, and aluminium cans use just 5% of the energy needed to produce them from scratch and only release 5% of the amount of greenhouse gases. In addition, it is the easiest material to extract and separate from the other recyclables, using magnets for steel cans and special magnets (eddy currents) it guarantees recycling of every can.\nIn 2013, the Alliance for Beverage Cartons and the Environment and  opened the UK's first carton recycling facility in . Prior to this, recycling was limited because of the high shipping costs for export, but the new plant processes 40 percent of the country's carton waste. Problems also arise because cartons cannot use recycled fibre, so they are converted into cardboard instead.\nThe  implemented the  (WEEE Directive, 2002/96/EC) in February 2003. It requires manufacturers to shoulder the burden of recycling by reimbursing the recyclers' costs. It also set a minimum quota of 4\u00a0kg per capita of  per head by 2009.\nThe United Kingdom was the final member state to pass it into law. The success of the WEEE directive has varied significantly from state to state, with collection rates varying between 13 kilograms per capita per annum to as little as 1\u00a0kg per capita per annum.  Computers & electronic wastes collected from households within Europe are treated under the WEEE directive via Producer Compliance Schemes (whereby manufacturers of Electronics pay into a scheme that funds its recovery from  (HWRCs)) and nominated Waste Treatment Facilities (known as Obligated WEEE).\nHowever, recycling of ex corporate Computer Hardware and associated electronic equipment falls outside the Producer Compliance Scheme (Known as non-obligated). In the UK, Waste or obsolete corporate related computer hardware is treated via third party Authorized Treatment Facilities, who normally impose a charge for its collection and treatment.\nAlthough recycling is required right across the UK, recycling rules differ depending on the local council. Some local councils have implemented a one-box system for separating household waste, whereas others have provided many more boxes, and this recyclable waste is often collected at different times from standard landfill waste collections.\nThere are also different schemes in place across the country to determine where the waste goes and how it is used.\nIn England, the local authorities are given targets by Defra. It is these local targets which help the government to achieve its national targets. However, local authorities are given flexibility in deciding how to best meet these targets, hence the number of different schemes in place.\nThe issue of  and recycling is acute in  - the capital produces 17 million  of waste each year, forecast to rise to 26.5 million tonnes in 2020. The   sets the framework for dealing with waste within a London-wide  including recycling targets for the  to meet, which are made statutory within the .  The existing organisational arrangements however are complex with a number of  at sub-regional and local levels.\n City Council have introduced three  schemes.\nThese three schemes are now available to most of Birmingham's homes depending on whether they have a garden. The Paper & Garden Waste recycling facility is available to all houses in Birmingham. The Green Box scheme is going to be available to all houses later this year. Every year 3500 tonnes of paper and 8900 tonnes of wood are recycled. There are five household recycling centres and over 400 recycling banks across the whole of Birmingham.\nRecycling banks normally include:\n Borough Council now has a six bin collection scheme.\nThere has been criticism from residents of Newcastle-under-Lyme after the council spent \u00a32.4 million to improve its recycling in the borough, however the fleet of new vehicles are too wide to fit down some narrow roads. This has left some residents going for up to a fortnight without any waste collection service.\nThere have been a number of controversies in recent years involving the recycling policies of various local councils:\nOne of the major problems for recycling at home has been the provision of multiple containers to sort the waste. This has been criticised for being too confusing for many residents, with one of the biggest offenders being the Newcastle-under-Lyme council which implemented a nine-bin system in 2010. Other councils have provided up to seven bins, although some private contractors provide only one, and separate the recyclable material themselves.\nWhen fortnightly collections were brought in during 2007, they caused a lot of controversy. Many people were against them because it meant that they had to keep hold of their waste for longer and it was feared that this could be unhygienic, with fears arising in the press about health problems being caused as a result. However research conducted by Cranfield University and Enviros in 2007, found that there is unlikely to be significantly greater health issues relating to fortnightly collections against weekly. \nIn January 2014 the Secretary Of State for Communities and Local Government outlined guidance for how weekly collections could be achieved by local authorities. This was supported by a \u00a3250 million scheme made available to participating waste authorities. As of January 2015 no council has elected to fully adopt the scheme under the new system due to budget cuts and a commitment to the European Waste Directive targets. The Chartered Institution of Wastes Management (CIWM) questioned \u201cwhether the focus of the \u00a3250 million fund will deliver the\nbest environmental and economic outcomes\u201d and suggested that the money could better be spent on alternative options. It went on:\n'the additional money could more usefully have been focused on delivering improvements in three key areas: supporting more recycling, either by expanding the range of materials collected or improving participation; supporting an expansion in food waste collections, which is the main area of householder concern regarding collection frequency; and supporting waste prevention initiatives... In economic terms, with so many constraints on council budgets, it is important to ensure that this policy initiative does not lock local councils into significantly higher waste collection costs, for which we will all have to foot the bill long after the Weekly Collections Support Scheme funding has run dry'.\n"},

A number of , including , , , , , , , , , , and  have passed laws that establish  or refund values on  containers while other jurisdictions rely on recycling goals or  bans of recyclable materials.\nOn a national level, the  (EPA) oversees a variety of waste issues under the mandate of the .  These include regulation of hazardous wastes, landfill regulations, and setting recycling goals.\nThe  is also responsible for helping to develop markets for recycled goods.\nMore specific recycling legislation is localized through city or state governments. State regulation falls into two major categories: landfill bans and recycling goals.  Landfill bans make it illegal to dispose of enumerated items in a landfill. Most often these items include yard waste, oil, and recyclables easily collected in .  States with landfill bans of recyclables include , , , and .  Other states focus on recycling goals. These include  and .  One way in which some states encourage recycling of specific drink containers is through the passage of a .\nA number of U.S. states, such as California, Hawaii, Oregon, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts, Iowa, Michigan, and New York have passed laws that establish deposits or refund values on beverage containers in order to promote reuse and recycling. Most are five cents per can or bottle. Michigan's has maintained a 10 cent deposit value for bottles and cans since 1976.\nSome cities, such as , and states like Connecticut, have created mandatory recycling laws that may fine citizens who throw away a certain percentage of recyclable materials in their garbage waste. Vermont also employed a landfill ban of recyclable materials, food and yard waste, and wood. There are also voluntary programs and educational programs to increase recycling where it is not mandated by law.\nDisposal of recyclables in the garbage is prohibited from households, businesses and apartments. For businesses, that would include prohibiting the disposal of cardboard, paper, and yard waste in the garbage. For apartments and houses, disposal of glass, paper, cardboard, aluminum, and plastic in the garbage would be prohibited. With businesses and apartments, if garbage collectors find more than 10 percent of the container filled with recyclables, they will leave a tag. On the third tag, the business or apartment tenants will receive a $50 fine. However, households do not face the risk of being fined. If trash collectors find over 10 percent of their garbage contains recyclables, they will leave a tag asking the household to separate the garbage and recyclables for collection the next week.\nIn a 1996 article in ,  claimed that government mandated recycling wastes more resources than it saves.\nTierney's article received a referenced critique from the , which noted that \"the article relied heavily on quotes and information supplied by a group of consultants and think tanks that have strong ideological objections to recycling or a vested financial\ninterest in opposing it\".\nIn 2003, Daniel K. Benjamin (a professor of economics at Clemson University) published a paper through the  that reiterated many of the points brought up in the , backing them up with a detailed inquiry into the recycling industry of the US. In 2010, he followed up on that with an updated look into the recycling policies of the US, finding that not much has changed.\nWhen the recycling industry was in its infancy in the United States, the financial costs of collecting, depositing, and processing recyclables exceeded that of trash disposal. Some opponents of recycling argued that state support for recycling may be more financially expensive in the short term than alternatives such as  disposal. For example, recycling efforts in  cost $57 million per year in 2002 and by 2015 it cost the city $300 more to recycle each ton of waste than to dump it in landfill.  To refute this argument, people pointed out that the  to society from recycling compensate for any difference in cost. Landfilling waste is an inefficient use of resources, contributes to global warming through the release of methane into the atmosphere when unharvested or incompletely harvested, and by the pollution of groundwater and waterways. The long term financial and social costs of pollution caused by landfilling waste are often not taken into consideration.\nHowever, in many regions of the country, there are now economic incentives to recycle. As early as 2003, Fort Worth Texas was making $1,000,000 from their recycling program.  Similarly, 's recycling program in Wisconsin began operating with positive revenues in 2004.\nMost recently, Waukesha County began receiving a $6.50 per ton bonus for recyclables coming into their private MRF (Materials Recycling Facility). Combining that with the average revenue from the sale of the materials minus the long-term costs incurred if the items had been landfilled, the average total lost revenue (county's share) for recyclables thrown in the landfill is $112.50.\nRecycling statistics (ca. 2014) with similar numbers as of 2015\n reported in May 2018 that in some cases, 25% of all recyclables collected are sent to landfill. Contamination can occur from unwashed plastics and greasy cardboard or paper items. If materials are not clean \u2013 off to the landfill they go. \nRecycling rates vary by material and product type.\nElectronic waste or e-waste describes discarded electrical or . Used electronics which are destined for reuse, resale, salvage, recycling, or disposal are also considered e-waste. Informal processing of e-waste in developing countries can lead to adverse  effects and environmental .\nElectronic scrap components, such as , contain potentially harmful components such as , , , or .  may involve significant risk to workers and communities in developed countries and great care must be taken to avoid unsafe exposure in recycling operations and leaking of materials such as heavy metals from  and  ashes.\nAccording to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), it is important to dispose of electronics via recycling because,\"Electronic products are made from valuable resources and materials, including metals, plastics, and glass, all of which require energy to mine and manufacture. Donating or recycling consumer electronics conserves our natural resources and avoids air and water pollution, as well as greenhouse gas emissions that are caused by manufacturing virgin materials.\" Consumer recycling options include donating equipment directly to organizations in need, sending devices directly back to their original manufacturers, or getting components to a convenient recycler or refurbisher.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency reports 290 million  were generated in 2003.  Of the 290 million, 45 million of these scrap tires were used to make automotive and truck tire . In 2017, 287 million were generated, 38 million reused and 249 million scrapped. With  minimizing their acceptance of whole tires and the health and environmental risks of stockpiling tires, many new markets have been created for scrap tires.  Growing markets exist for a majority of scrap tires produced every year, supported by state and local government. Tires are also often recycled for use on basketball courts and new shoe products.\nTires are not desired at , due to their large volumes and 75% void space, which quickly consumes valuable space. As of 2017, 40 states banned whole tires from landfills, 38 allowed shredded tires, 24 allowed processed tires in mono-fills. Fees are collected by 37 states.\nIn 2017, 81.4% of scrapped tires were marketed for some beneficial use, down from 87.9% in 2015. Of the 3,411 thousand tons of marketed scrap tires, 50.8% were used as fuel, 29.6% as ground rubber. Of the tires used as fuel, 46% were consumed in cement kilns, 29% in pulp and paper mills and 25% in electric utility boilers.\nThe United States has decreased the number of waste tires in storage from about 1 billion in 1992, down to 60 million tires in 2017, primarily due to state scrap management programs. Most of the remaining stockpiles are in Colorado and Texas.\nUS state laws and regulations dealing with scrap tires are currently enacted in 48 states.  Here are some common features of state programs that deal with scrap tires: source of funding for the program; licensing or registration of scrap tire haulers, processors, and end users; manifests for scrap tire shipments; limitations on who may handle scrap tires; financial assurance requirements for scrap tire handlers; and market development activities.  Some state programs are now supported by fees charged to the consumer at purchase or disposal of each tire.  These fees, sometimes called \u201ctipping fees\u201d, help to support recycling costs.  When the disposal rates charged to consumers are set high, this, in turn, discourages landfill disposal, a simple solution encouraging more affordable tire recycling programs.\nFor most of the early twenty-first century, China was the main destination for the world's scrap material.  This resulted from a combination of factors, including the growing need for metal, paper and plastics in China's expanding industry, lax environmental regulations, cheap labor, and inexpensive shipping using containers that would otherwise be returned to China empty.  In the United States, this resulted in a strong market for many scrap commodities and allowed local recycling programs to come close to breaking even economically or even to turn a small profit.  That situation abruptly changed in 2017 when China announced its \u2018\u2019\u2019National Sword\u2019\u2019\u2019 program which banned many scrap imports and imposed strict quality standards on others, starting in February 2018.  Acceptable limits for contamination in imported waste were cut from 5-10 percent to 0.5 percent.  Since then almost no plastic scrap has been exported to China from the United States and shipments of metal and paper scrap have been sharply reduced. Scrap plastic imports dropped from 3.5 million metric tons in 2017 to 21,300 metric tons in the first half of 2018. As a result, scrap prices in the US have plummeted.  The US recycling industry is responding by investing in better sorting equipment to attempt to meet the National Sword standards and by developing new market for waste materials both within the US and in other countries, including Southeast Asia and India.  However several countries in Southeast Asia have announced their own restrictions on recycling.\nThe first post- World War II mass recycling program in the United States, \"Ban The Can,\" was conceived and executed in 1970 by Ruth \"Pat\" Webb in .  Webb organized military and civilian volunteers to collect over 9 tons (8,200\u00a0kg) of metal cans from the roadways and highways of . The metal cans were later recycled into steel reinforcement bars to be used in local construction projects.\nThe Stanolind Recycling Plant was in operation as early 1947. Another early recycling mill was Waste Techniques, built in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania in 1972. Waste Techniques was sold to Frank Keel in 1978, and resold to BFI in 1981. , was the first city in the United States to mandate recycling.  Led by Donald Sanderson who was President of Woodbury City Council and Woodbury Recycling Committee in the early 1970s, the idea of towing a \"recycling\" trailer behind a waste management vehicle to enable the collection of trash and recyclable material at the same time emerged. Other towns and cities soon followed suit, and today many cities in the United States make recycling a requirement.\nIn 1987, the  barge hauled garbage from  to ; where it was denied. It was then sent to , where it was denied as well. Finally, the barge returned to New York and the garbage was incinerated. The incident led to heated discussions in the media about waste disposal and recycling. The incident is often referred to as igniting the recycling \"hysteria\" of the 1990s.\nIntegrating recycling into K-12 educational system has become a goal for many educators.  Usually, it is integrated into science or social studies classrooms.  This is due to its inclusion in the national education standards for both of these subject areas.  Common areas that recycling is integrated into the curriculum include areas such as the study of natural resources, general environmental units, soil units, water units, community units, economic units, and geography units.  Although interest is growing, major textbook publishers do not always include recycling in a textbook so teachers are left to supplement the textbooks with outside curriculum to meet the national standards.  For example, in a unit about trees or natural resources teachers could include supplemental curriculum about recycling because in the textbook it is never explicitly covered.  Non-profit organizations as well as governmental organizations have created supplemental curriculum for teachers to fill this void.  Some purely non-profit groups include the  and .  Other creators of curriculum include governmental offices.  Some of these include Oregon, California, and Waukesha County, Wisconsin.  Also, some non-profit organizations have partnered with sections of the government to collaborate on educational materials.  For example, the  partnered with the  and the  to create curriculum on .\nAmerica Recycles Day (ARD) is the only nationally recognized day dedicated to encouraging Americans to recycle and buy recycled products. ARD is celebrated annually on November 15. The World Recycling Day celebrated in most countries, though falls on July 8. Thousands of events are held across the U.S. to raise awareness about the importance of recycling and to encourage American to sign personal pledges to recycle and buy products made from recycled materials.\nStarted by the recycling sector organization  in 1997, America Recycles Day has been a program of national nonprofit  since 2009. As the managing entity of America Recycles Day, Keep America Beautiful provides promotional and marketing support and resources to a network of local event organizers.  It is sponsored by private and public entities and the EPA.\nAlthough America may not enjoy much of a reputation for  on the global stage, in some US cities, recycling levels are much higher than, for example, in the .\n"},

The recycling rate for  exceeds 50 percent (with an objective of 60 percent in 2020).\nHowever, although the recycling rate of 54 percent is above the European average of 28 percent (2015), Switzerland is among the largest waste producers in Europe (730 kg of waste per capita in 2014). In 2009, 2,801,285 tons of waste from households and small businesses was recycled and 2,680,359 tons of municipal waste was incinerated.\nIn Switzerland, the following common household waste materials are recycled: aluminium and tin cans, old batteries, light bulbs, glass, paper, PET bottles, textiles, electrical and electronic equipment, and other. The disposal of recyclable waste is mostly free of charge, though not always operated as door-to-door collection. Some waste must be brought to collection spots (e.g. glass, metal, textiles), some is collected in supermarkets or retail shops (e.g. batteries, PET bottles, old electrical and electronic equipment). \nThe seven Swiss recycling organisations: FERRO-Recycling (tin cans), IGORA (household aluminium), INOBAT (household batteries), PET-Recycling Switzerland (PET beverage bottles), the SENS Foundation (electrical and electronic equipment), TEXAID (textiles) and VetroSwiss (glass) are united in the umbrella organisation .\n\"This association exploits the communication synergies that exist between the individual recycling organisations by providing a common platform for disseminating information on the separate collection and appropriate recycling of materials. The association's independence and expertise make it a key contact for official bodies, politicians, retailers and schools throughout Switzerland on all issues relating to recycling.\"\n\nThe recycling rates of the individual recyclable materials reached in 2006 a mean of 76% of all currently recyclable items being recycled. This has narrowly surpassed the Swiss government's 75% target, meaning that for the time being there will be no introduction of a recycling tax on glass bottles and jars, nor on clothes and textiles, plastic bottles, home-use batteries, light bulbs or paperware and card.\nSince the introduction of landfilling ban in Switzerland on 1 January 2000, all non recycled combustible waste must be incinerated. Switzerland disposes of 30 municipal solid waste incinerating facilities (November 2018).\n\nAccording to  in Switzerland in 2012 5.5 million tonnes of  were produced (694 kg/person/year).\nIn many places in Switzerland, household rubbish disposal and collection is charged for. Household refuse (except dangerous and cumbersome items, batteries, sofas, electrical appliances etc.) in theory, is only to be collected if it is in bags which either have a payment sticker attached, in official bags with the surcharge paid when the bags are purchased or weighed at central collection bins. However in practice, this is difficult to enforce, for hygiene reasons and difficulty in identifying the perpetrators. However it is a financial incentive to recycle as much as possible, for recycling is usually free of charge or cheaper, albeit not always operated through a door-to-door collection. Swiss health officials and police often open up garbage for which the disposal charge has not been paid. They search for evidence such as old bills which connect the bag to the household/person they originated from. Fines for not paying the disposal fee can now be up to  10,000.- in some municipalities. Again many people are now aware of this and remove their names and details from any documentation disposed of illegally before trashing it, therefore rendering it impossible and futile for health officials to identify where the rubbish is coming from. In fact in some areas the cost of the payment stickers or official rubbish sacks has fallen slightly. However, where this has occurred, an annual taxation on refuse collection has been introduced or reintroduced as it were. In some extraordinary cases, a handful of municipalities have introduced refuse weighing machines and electronic chip-cards which need to be 'topped up' with money, thus enforcing payment for refuse elimination by weight and not volume. Again causing problems for elderly residents who would have to somehow get to the nearest refuse disposal point, possibly having to walk uphill or a significant distance. All such methods are proving unpopular Switzerland-wide, especially, as said, amongst the ageing Swiss nationals who often find it difficult to come to grips with the ever-imposing technological era. Dumping refuse and household waste inappropriately or illegally incurs a heavy fine.\n"},

In 2005,  produced about 7.34 million tonnes of solid wastes, of which 30% are possibly recyclable but only 3-5% were actually processed.

The same report indicated that Kuantan had the highest household recycling rate (18.4%) while Sabah rest at the lowest with 4.5%. Kuala Lumpur, the nation's capital with an estimated population of 1.66 million people in 2009, produced household waste of around 0.8 to 1.3 kg per day, that amount together with the industrial waste of the city led to the generation of an average 3,500 tonnes of waste per day.

Since then, imports of plastic waste into Malaysia has surged. According to a Greenpeace report  \"Malaysia imported 195,444.46 metric tonnes of plastic waste from the  (US) from January to July 2018 alone, in comparison to a total of 97,544 metric tonnes for January to November 2017\". The report warned that there were regulation violations in the disposal of imported plastic waste to the country (plastic is burned on roadsides in the open-air, dumped in unregulated or poorly regulated dump sites close to bodies of water, discarded in abandoned buildings or just left to degrade and rot in the open) thus contributing to environmental pollution and harmful health impact for Malaysians. These wastes come primarily from developed countries, with the US, Japan, , being the top 3, and Australia, New Zealand, Finland, France, Belgium, Germany, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland as the rest. In October 2018, the   announced that the country would imposed a limit and eventual ban on the import of all non-recyclable solid waste, particularly plastic and that up to 30 illegal factories have been closed.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuse_of_excreta", "title": "ReuseofexcretaWikipedia", "body": " refers to the safe, beneficial use of animal or , i.e.  and . Such beneficial use involves mainly the nutrient, organic matter and energy contained in human waste, rather than the water content (as is the case for . Reuse of human waste can involve using it as a  or  in , , , or  activities. Excreta can also be  or as a building material.\nHuman waste contains resources that can be recovered: plant-available nutrients , ,  as well as micronutrients such as  and . These resources which are contained in human waste or in domestic  ()  have traditionally been used in agriculture in many countries. They are still being used in agriculture to this day, but the practice is often carried out in an unregulated and unsafe manner in developing countries. The WHO Guidelines from 2006 have set up a framework how this reuse can be done safely by following a \"multiple barrier approach\".\nThere are several \"excreta-derived fertilizers\" which vary in their properties and fertilizing characteristics: urine, dried feces, composted feces,  (septage), , , and animal . However, reuse of human waste can cause health risk and environmental problems because of pathogen, pharmaceutical residues and nitrate pollution.\nReuse of human waste is the final step of the  chain which starts with collection of human waste (by use of ) and continues with transport and treatment all the way to either disposal or reuse.\n systems that are designed for safe and effective  can play an important role in a community's overall . Various technologies and practices, ranging in scale from a single rural household to a city, can be used to capture potentially valuable resources and make them available for safe, productive uses that support human well-being and broader .\nThe resources available in wastewater and human waste include water, ,  and energy content.  Reuse of human waste focuses on the nutrient and organic matter content of human waste unlike  which focuses on the water content.\nThe most common type of reuse of excreta is as fertilizer and soil conditioner in agriculture. This is also called a \"closing the loop\" approach for  with agriculture. It is a central aspect of the  approach. An alternative term is also \"use of human waste\" rather than \"\" as strictly speaking it is the   of human waste, not the second time that it is used.\nIt can be efficient to combine wastewater and human waste with other  such as manure, food and crop waste for the purposes of resource recovery.\nReuse options depend on the form of the excreta that is being reused: it can be either excreta on its own or mixed with some water () or mixed with lots of water (domestic wastewater or ).\nThe most common types of excreta reuse include:\nResource recovery from fecal sludge can take many forms, including as a fuel, soil amendment, building material, protein, animal fodder, and water for irrigation.\nResearch into how to make reuse of urine and feces safe in agriculture was carried out in Sweden since the 1990s. In 2006 the  (WHO) provided guidelines on safe reuse of wastewater, excreta and greywater. The multiple barrier concept to reuse, which is the key cornerstone of this publication, has led to a clear understanding of how excreta reuse can be done safely. The concept is also used in water supply and food production, and is generally understood as a series of treatment steps and other safety precautions to prevent the spread of pathogens.\nThe degree of treatment required for excreta-based fertilizers before they can safely be used in agriculture depends on a number of factors. It mainly depends on which other barriers will be put in place according to the multiple barrier concept. Such barriers might be selecting a suitable crop, farming methods, methods of applying the fertilizer, education, and so forth.\nFor example, in the case of  (UDDTs) secondary treatment of dried feces can be performed at community level rather than at household level and can include  where fecal material is composted at over 50\u00a0\u00b0C, prolonged storage with the duration of 1.5 to two years, chemical treatment with ammonia from urine to inactivate the pathogens, solar sanitation for further drying or heat treatment to eliminate pathogens.\nThere is an untapped fertilizer resource in human excreta. In Africa, for example, the theoretical quantities of nutrients that can be recovered from human excreta are comparable with all current fertilizer use on the continent. Therefore, reuse can support increased food production and also provide an alternative to chemical fertilizers, which is often unaffordable to small-holder farmers. However, nutritional value of human excreta largely depends on dietary input.\nMineral fertilizers are made from mining activities and can contain heavy metals. Phosphate ores contain heavy metals such as cadmium and uranium, which can reach the food chain via mineral phosphate fertilizer. This does not apply to excreta-based fertilizers, which is an advantage.\nIn intensive agricultural land use, animal manure is often not used as targeted as mineral fertilizers, and thus, the nitrogen utilization efficiency is poor. Animal manure can become a problem in terms of excessive use in areas of intensive agriculture with high numbers of livestock and too little available farmland.\nFertilizing elements of organic fertilizers are mostly bound in carbonaceous reduced compounds. If these are already partially oxidized as in the compost, the fertilizing minerals are adsorbed on the degradation products () etc. Thus, they exhibit a slow-release effect and are usually less rapidly leached compared to mineral fertilizers.\nIn the case of phosphorus in particular, reuse of excreta is one known method to recover phosphorus to mitigate the looming shortage (also known as \"\") of economical mined phosphorus. Mined phosphorus is a limited resource that is being used up for fertilizer production at an ever-increasing rate, which is threatening worldwide . Therefore, phosphorus from excreta-based fertilizers is an interesting alternative to fertilizers containing mined phosphate ore.\n is primarily composed of water and . It contains large quantities of  (N) (mostly as urea), as well as reasonable quantities of dissolved . The nutrient concentrations in urine vary with diet. In particular, nitrogen content in urine is related to quantity of protein in the diet: A high protein diet results in high urea levels in urine. Urine's eight main ionic species (> 0.1 meq L\u22121) are  , , ,  and the , , ,  and .  Urine typically contains 70% of the nitrogen and more than half the  found in , while making up less than 1% of the overall volume.\nUrine fertilizer is usually applied diluted with water because undiluted urine can  the leaves or roots of some plants, particularly if the soil moisture content is low. The dilution also helps to reduce odor development following application. Applying urine as fertilizer has been called \"closing the cycle of agricultural nutrient flows\" or ecological sanitation or .\nWhen diluted with water (at a 1:5 ratio for container-grown  crops with fresh growing medium each season or a 1:8 ratio for more general use), it can be applied directly to soil as a fertilizer. The fertilization effect of urine has been found to be comparable to that of commercial nitrogen fertilizers. Urine may contain pharmaceutical residues ().\nThe more general limitations to using urine as fertilizer depend mainly on the potential for buildup of excess nitrogen (due to the high ratio of that macronutrient), and inorganic  such as , which are also part of the wastes excreted by the .  with urine or other nitrogen fertilizers can result in too much ammonia for plants to absorb, acidic conditions, or other . Important parameters to consider while fertilizing with urine include salinity tolerance of the plant, soil composition, addition of other fertilizing compounds, and quantity of rainfall or other irrigation.\nIt was reported in 1995 that urine nitrogen gaseous losses were relatively high and plant uptake lower than with labelled . In contrast,  was utilized at a higher rate than soluble phosphate.\nHuman urine can be collected with  systems that utilize  or  toilets. If urine is to be collected for use as a fertilizer in agriculture, then the easiest method of doing so is (in increasing order of costs) by using waterless ,  or  flush toilets.\nThe risks of using urine as a natural source of agricultural fertilizer are generally regarded as negligible or acceptable. There are potentially more environmental problems (such as  resulting from the influx of nutrient rich effluent into aquatic or marine ecosystems) and a higher energy consumption when urine is treated as part of  in  compared with when it is used directly as a fertilizer resource.\nIn developing countries, the use of raw sewage or  has been common throughout history, yet the application of pure urine to crops is rare. There are increasing calls for urine's use as a fertilizer.\nSince about 2011, the  is providing research funding sanitation systems that recover the nutrients in urine.\nReuse of dried  (feces) from  (UDDTs) after post-treatment can result in increased crop production through fertilizing effects of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and improved  through organic carbon.\n derived from  (where organic kitchen waste is in some cases also added to the composting toilet) has, in principle, the same uses as compost derived from other organic waste products, such as  or municipal organic waste. One limiting factor may be legal restrictions due to the possibility that pathogens remain in the compost. In any case, the use of compost from composting toilets in one's own garden can be regarded as safe and is the main method of use for compost from composting toilets. Hygienic measures for handling of the compost must be applied by all those people who are exposed to it, e.g. wearing gloves and boots.\nSome of the  will be part of the compost although some urine will be lost via leachate and evaporation.  can contain up to 90 percent of the , up to 50 percent of the , and up to 70 percent of the  present in human excreta.\nThe nutrients in compost from a composting toilet have a higher plant availability than the product (dried feces) from a .\n (also called ) is defined as \"coming from onsite sanitation technologies, and has not been transported through a sewer.\" Examples of onsite technologies include pit latrines, unsewered public ablution blocks, septic tanks and dry toilets. Fecal sludge can be treated by a variety of methods to render it suitable for reuse in agriculture. These include (usually carried out in combination) dewatering, thickening, drying (in sludge drying beds), , pelletization, and .\n can be reused for irrigation, industrial uses, replenishing natural water courses, water bodies, s and other potable and non-potable uses. These applications, however, focus usually on the water aspect, not on the nutrients and organic matter reuse aspect, which is the focus of \"reuse of excreta\".\nWhen wastewater is reused in agriculture, its nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) content may be useful for additional fertilizer application. Work by the  and others has led to guidelines on how reuse of municipal wastewater in agriculture for irrigation and fertilizer application can be safely implemented in low income countries.\nThe use of treated  (after treatment also called \"\") as a  or fertilizer is possible but is a controversial topic in some countries (such as USA, some countries in Europe) due to the chemical pollutants it may contain, such as heavy metals and .\n in the  uses two  to produce what the company calls \"poo power\" - using  to produce energy to generate income.  production has reduced its pre 1996  expenditure of 20 million  by about 20% .  and  also have similar projects.\nSludge treatment liquids (after ) can be used as an input source for a process to recover phosphorus in the form of  for use as fertilizer. For example, the Canadian company Ostara Nutrient Recovery Technologies is marketing a process based on controlled chemical precipitation of phosphorus in a fluidized bed reactor that recovers struvite in the form of crystalline pellets from sludge dewatering streams. The resulting crystalline product is sold to the ,  and  sectors as fertilizer under the registered trade name \"Crystal Green\".\nAnimal dung () has been used for centuries as a fertilizer for , as it improves the soil structure (aggregation), so that it holds more nutrients and water and becomes more fertile.  Animal manure also encourages soil microbial activity, which promotes the soil's trace mineral supply, improving plant nutrition.  It also contains some nitrogen and other nutrients that assist the growth of plants.\nExposure of farm workers to untreated excreta constitutes a significant health risk due to its  content. There can be a large amount of enteric bacteria, virus, protozoa, and helminth eggs in feces. This risk also extends to consumers of crops fertilized with untreated excreta. Therefore, excreta needs to be appropriately treated before reuse, and health aspects need to be managed for all reuse applications as the excreta can contain  even after treatment.\nThe treatment of excreta and wastewater for pathogen removal can take place: \nAs an  in reuse schemes,  eggs are commonly used as these organisms are the most difficult to destroy in most treatment processes. The multiple barrier approach is recommended where e.g. lower levels of treatment may be acceptable when combined with other post-treatment barriers along the  chain.\nExcreta from humans and farmed animals contain  and  residues which could in theory enter the food chain via fertilized crops but are currently not fully removed by conventional wastewater treatment plants anyway and can enter drinking water sources via household wastewater (sewage). In fact, the pharmaceutical residues in the excreta are degraded better in terrestrial systems (soil) than in aquatic systems.\nOnly a fraction of the nitrogen-based fertilizers is converted to produce and other plant matter. The remainder accumulates in the soil or lost as run-off. This also applies to excreta-based fertilizer since it also contains nitrogen. Excessive nitrogen which is not taken up by plants is transformed into nitrate which is easily leached. High application rates combined with the high water-solubility of nitrate leads to increased  into  as well as  into . Nitrate levels above 10\u00a0mg/L (10 ppm) in groundwater can cause '' (acquired ). The nutrients, especially nitrates, in fertilizers can cause problems for natural habitats and for human health if they are washed off soil into watercourses or leached through soil into groundwater.\nApart from use in agriculture, there are other possible uses of excreta. For example, in the case of fecal sludge, it can be treated and then serve as protein ( process), , fish food, building materials and  ( from , incineration or co-combustion of dried sludge, pyrolysis of fecal sludge, biodiesel from fecal sludge).\n is used as a fuel in many countries around the world.\nPilot scale research in Uganda and Senegal has shown that it is viable to use dry feces as for combustion in industry, provided it has been dried to a minimum of 28% dry solids.\nDried sewage sludge can be burned in  plants and generate heat and electricity (the  process is one example).\nResource recovery of fecal sludge as a solid fuel has been found to have high market potential in .\nUrine has also been investigated as a potential source of . Urine was found to be a suitable wastewater for high rate hydrogen production in a  (MEC).\nSmall-scale  plants are being utilized in many countries, including Ghana, Vietnam and many others. Larger centralized systems are being planned that mix animal and human feces to produce biogas. Biogas is also produced during  processes with .  Here, it can be used for heating the digesters and for generating electricity.\nPilot facilities are being developed for feeding  with feces.  The mature flies would then be a source of protein to be included in the production of feed for chickens in South Africa.\nIt is known that additions of fecal matter up to 20% by dried weight in clay bricks does not make a significant functional difference to bricks.\nA Japanese sewage treatment facility extracts  from . This idea was also tested by the US Geological Survey (USGS) which found that the sewage sludge generated by 1 million people contained 13 million dollars worth of precious metals.\nThe reuse of excreta as a fertilizer for growing crops has been practiced in many countries for a long time.\nDebate is ongoing about whether reuse of excreta is cost effective. The terms \"sanitation economy\" and \"toilet resources\" have been introduced to describe the potential for selling products made from  or .\nThe NGO  in  began building  and  the waste produced for agricultural use in 2006. SOIL's two composting waste treatment facilities currently transform over 20,000 gallons (75,708 liters) of human excreta into organic, agricultural-grade compost every month. The compost produced at these facilities is sold to farmers, organizations, businesses, and institutions around the country to help finance SOIL's waste treatment operations. Crops grown with this soil amendment include spinach, peppers, sorghum, maize, and more. Each batch of compost produced is tested for the   to ensure that complete pathogen kill has taken place during the  composting process.\nThere is still a lack of examples of implemented policy where the reuse aspect is fully integrated in policy and advocacy. When considering drivers for policy change in this respect, the following lessons learned should be taken into consideration: Revising legislation does not necessarily lead to functioning reuse systems; it is important to describe the \u201cinstitutional landscape\u201d and involve all actors; parallel processes should be initiated at all levels of government (i.e. national, regional and local level); country specific strategies and approaches are needed; and strategies supporting newly developed policies need to be developed).\nRegulations such as Global  may hinder export and import of agricultural products that have been grown with the application of human excreta-derived fertilisers.\nThe  (EU) only allows the use of source separated urine in conventional farming within the EU, but not yet in organic farming. This is a situation that many agricultural experts, especially in Sweden, would like to see changed. This ban may also reduce the options to use urine as a fertilizer in other countries if they wish to export their products to the EU.\nIn the United States, the EPA regulation governs the management of  but has no jurisdiction over the byproducts of a  (UDDT). Oversight of these materials falls to the states.\n"},

The Irish  (EPA) is the agency with overall responsibility for environmental protection in the Republic of Ireland and monitors rates of recycling in Ireland along with other measures of environmental conditions in Ireland. The EPA, along with Repak, the principal organisation for  recycling in Ireland, report on recycling rates each year. In 2012 Ireland\u2019s MSW recycling rate was 34%, while the rate of packaging recycling reached 79% (the second highest in the European Union behind Germany). The amount of municipal waste generated per person per year in the Republic of Ireland has fallen significantly in recent years (from over 800\u00a0kg of waste in 2007 to 570\u00a0kg per person in 2012). This figure remains above the European Union annual municipal waste average of 503\u00a0kg per person however.\nEach local council in Ireland has considerable control over recycling, so recycling practices vary to some extent across the country. Most  that is not recycled is disposed of in  sites.\nOne noticeable success in Ireland's environmental track record was the introduction of a plastic bag levy in 2002, the first country in the world to do so. All consumers were required to pay 15c for a plastic bag; this led to an immediate decrease of over 90% in the amount of  in circulation. From 328 bags per inhabitant per year when the levy was introduced, usage fell to 21 bags per capita.\nThe levy encouraged retailers to switch to paper bags, and encouraged consumers to bring their own bags when shopping. The National Litter Pollution Monitoring System showed that when the levy was introduced, 5% of all litter was plastic bags. The 2006 figure is 0.5%. Media coverage also helped raise awareness about the damage plastic bags do to the environment.\nThere has been some evidence of complacency, however, suggesting that the number of plastic bags had begun to rise again to 33 bags per capita. To address this, the levy was increased in July 2006 to 22c; preliminary figures indicate the rate has again fallen to 21 bags per capita. In Dunnes Stores single use bags are no longer sold. Customers may purchase a bag for life priced at \u20ac1.\nThe  (WEEE) directive was introduced into Irish law in August 2005. Under this law, retailers of electrical goods are required to provide free in-store take back for old electrical goods for customers buying new electrical equipment. The cost of this is passed onto consumers.\nIreland is the top country in Europe for electronics recycling as a result of the WEEE directive, with 30,000 tonnes of electrical and electronic being collected in 2008. This works out at around 9 kilograms per person, a figure more than double the EU target.\n is Ireland's packaging recovery organisation.\nRepak is a not for profit company set up by Irish business and owned by its members. Repak charges fees to its members in accordance with the amount and type of packaging they place on the Irish market. These fees are used to subsidise the collection and recovery of  through registered recovery operators across Ireland \u2013 so that the individual member companies are exempt from this requirement. Repak is approved under licence by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to operate as a compliance scheme for packaging recovery. Since Repak was set up in 1997 packaging recycling in Ireland has grown from a very low base to the point where Ireland is now one of the leading recycling countries in the EU.\nFor more, see www.repak.ie\nAlthough waste collection practices vary in each county in Ireland, most services share the guiding principles that waste is sorted into different categories at household level and that waste collection charges are highest for waste going to landfill sites. Waste collection services have been increasingly run by private companies, rather than local government, over the last decade. In Dublin several companies now compete to provide waste collection services. Grey bins are used to collect non-recyclable waste. Green bins, used to collect  and glass, are collected every two weeks-householders can dispose of paper, cardboard, cans, plastic bottles and tins in this bin, and it is illegal to dispose of such waste in a grey bin. Most householders have to pay every time their grey bin is collected.\nIn 2008 Dublin City Council introduced use of a third bin (brown bin) to households in Dublin City Council area. This was introduced to reduce landfill use for compostable waste. Households use this brown bin to dispose of compostable waste such as grass and hedge cuttings and uncooked food waste. Dublin City Council began to charge for waste collection to fund improvements in recycling facilities.  Nine Bring Centres, which consist of bottle banks and recycling facilities were made available at various locations around the City in 2001. At the end of the year 54 public and 53 private bring centres were in operation.\" Most householders have to pay every time their grey bin is collected but pay a lesser fee for collection of their brown bin and no fee for collection of their green bin. This system is designed to discourage people from using the grey bin and therefore to reduce the amount of waste going into landfill.\nIn , Oxigen took over from the Dundalk Town Council for waste disposal. They have since in introduced a  (2001) and  (2007) along with the black bin. Up until the 2007 the black bins were collected every week but now they are collected every second week with the other bins been collected the week the black bins are not collected.\nVariations of this system are in place across the country. Some local authorities, such as , now outsource all waste collection to private authorities. Householders can choose what size bin they want, and pay accordingly. However, they are not charged every time the bin is collected. Other councils operate a weigh-and-pay system, where households are charged according to the weight of the ,for example,South Tipperary County Council charge 14c per kg (accurate as of 31 August 2007). Recyclable waste in South Tipperary is collected separately in plastic bags which are purchased at local shops, together with stickers that are placed on the bags.\nIn Galway city, over 50% of waste is now recycled, the highest proportion in the country.\nWebsites have been set up where people can post their junk or items they no longer need and have it taken away, such as , or the well known freecycle  sites.\nThere has been a sharp increase in the number of bottle banks and recycling facilities across the country over the last 10 years, but facilities continue to struggle with demand.\n is one of the major private waste collection company in the area.\n"},

At the end of their useful life, vehicles have value as a source of spare parts and this has created a vehicle dismantling industry. The industry has various names for its business outlets including , auto dismantling yard, car spare parts supplier, and recently, auto or vehicle recycling. Vehicle recycling has always occurred to some degree but in recent years manufacturers have become involved in the process. A  is often used to reduce the size of the scrapped vehicle for transportation to a steel mill.\nApproximately 12-15 million vehicles reach the end of their use each year in just the United States alone. These automobiles, although out of commission, can still have a purpose by giving back the metal and other recyclable materials that are contained in them. The vehicles are shredded and the metal content is recovered for recycling, while in many areas, the rest is further sorted by machine for recycling of additional materials such as glass and plastics. The remainder, known as automotive shredder residue, is put into a landfill.\nThe shredder residue of the vehicles that is not recovered for metal contains many other recyclable materials including 30% of it as polymers, and 5-10% of it as residual metals. Modern vehicle recycling attempts to be as cost-effective as possible in recycling those residual materials. Currently, 75% of the materials can be recycled, with the remaining 25% ending up in . As the most recycled consumer product, end-of-life vehicles provide the steel industry with more than 14 million tons of steel.\nThe process of recycling a vehicle is extremely complicated as there are many parts to be recycled and many hazardous materials to remove. Briefly, the process begins with incoming vehicles being inventoried for parts. The wheels and tires, battery and  are removed. Fluids, such as engine coolant, oil, transmission fluid, air conditioning refrigerant, and gasoline, are drained and removed. Certain high value parts such as electronic modules, , ,  systems - even complete engines or transmissions - may be removed if they are still serviceable and can be profitably sold on; either in \"as-is\" used condition or to a  for restoration. This process of removing higher value parts from the lower value vehicle body shell has traditionally been done by hand. A labour intensive process, that has meant it is uneconomical to remove many of the parts. \nA technique that is on the rise is the mechanical removal of these higher value parts via machine based vehicle recycling systems (VRS). An excavator or materials handler equipped with a special attachment allows these materials to be removed quickly and efficiently. Increasing the amount of material that is recycled and increasing the value the vehicle dismantler receives from an end-of-life vehicle (ELV). Other hazardous materials such as mercury, and  (the propellant used in ) may also be removed. \nAfter all of the parts and products inside are removed, the remaining shell of the vehicle is sometimes subject to further processing, which includes removal of the air conditioner evaporator and heater core, and wiring harnesses. The remaining shell is then crushed flat, or cubed, to facilitate economical transportation in bulk to an industrial shredder or hammer mill, where the vehicles are further reduced to fist-sized chunks of metal. Glass, plastic and rubber are removed from the mix, and the metal is sold by multiple tons to steel mills for recycling.\nRecycling steel saves energy and natural resources. The steel industry saves enough energy to power about 18 million households for a year, on a yearly basis. Recycling metal also uses about 74 percent less energy than making metal. Thus, recyclers of end-of-life vehicles save an estimated 85 million barrels of oil annually that would have been used in the manufacturing of other parts. Likewise, car recycling keeps 11 million tons of steel and 800,000 non-ferrous metals out of landfills and back in consumer use.\nBefore the 2003 model year, some vehicles that were manufactured were found to contain mercury auto switches, historically used in convenience lighting and antilock braking systems. Recyclers remove and recycle this mercury before the vehicles are shredded to prevent it from escaping into the environment. In 2007, over 2100 pounds of mercury were collected by 6265 recyclers.\nIn 1997, the European Commission adopted a Proposal for a Directive which aims at making vehicle dismantling and recycling more environmentally friendly by setting clear targets for the recycling of vehicles. This proposal encouraged many in Europe to consider the environmental impact of end-of-life vehicles. In September 2000, the  was officially adopted by the EP and Council. Over the next decade, more legislation would be adopted in order to clarify legal aspects, national practices, and recommendations.\nA number of vehicle manufacturers collaborated on developing the International Dismantling Information System to meet the legal obligations of the End of Life Vehicles Directive.\nIn 2018 the EC published a study . This study demonstrates that each year the whereabouts of 3 to 4 million ELVs across the EU is unknown and that the stipulation in the ELV Directive are not sufficient to monitor the performance of single Member States for this aspect. The study proposed and assessed a number of options to improve the legal provisions of the ELV Directive. \nOn 2 July 2009 and for the next 55 days, the , or \u201cCash for Clunkers\u201d, was an attempt at a green initiative by the United States Government in order to stimulate automobile sales and improve the average fuel economy of the United States. Many cars ended up being destroyed and recycled in order to fulfill the program, and even some exotic cars were crushed. Ultimately, as carbon footprints are of concern, some will argue that the \u201cCash for Clunkers\u201d did not reduce many owners\u2019 carbon footprints. A lot of carbon dioxide is added into the atmosphere to make new cars. It is calculated that if someone traded in an 18 mpg clunker for a 22 mpg new car, it would take five and a half years of typical driving to offset the new car\u2019s carbon footprint. That same number increases to eight or nine years for those who bought trucks.\nIf a vehicle is  on the roadside or in empty lots, licensed dismantlers in the United States can legally obtain them so that they are safely converted into reusable or recycled commodities.\n"},

These tires are a challenging source of waste, due to the large volume produced, the durability of the tires, and the components in the tire that are ecologically problematic.\nBecause tires are highly durable and non-biodegradable, they can consume valued space in landfills. In 1990, it was estimated that over 1 billion scrap tires were in stockpiles in the United States. As of 2015, only 67 million tires remain in stockpiles. From 1994 to 2010, the European Union increased the amount of tires recycled from 25% of annual discards to nearly 95%, with roughly half of the end-of-life tires used for energy, mostly in cement manufacturing.\nNewer technology, such as  and , has made tires suitable targets for recycling despite their bulk and resilience. Aside from use as fuel, the main end use for tires remains ground rubber.\nIn 2017, 13% of U.S. tires removed from their primary use were sold in the used tire market. Of the tires that were scrapped, 43% were burnt as , with cement manufacturing the largest user, another 25% were used to make ground rubber, 8% were used in civil engineering projects, 17% were disposed of in landfills and 8% had other uses.\nThe tire life cycle can be identified by the following six steps:\nTires are not desired at , due to their large volumes and 75% void space. Tires can trap  gases, causing them to become buoyant, or  to the surface. This 'bubbling' effect can damage  that have been installed to help keep landfill contaminants from polluting local surface and .\nShredded tires are now being used in landfills, replacing other construction materials, for a lightweight back-fill in gas venting systems,  collection systems, and operational liners. Shredded tire material may also be used to cap, close, or daily cover landfill sites. Scrap tires as a back-fill and cover material are also more cost-effective, since tires can be shredded on-site instead of hauling in other fill materials.\nTire stockpiles create a great health and safety risk.  can occur easily, burning for months and creating substantial  and . Recycling helps to reduce the number of tires in storage. An additional health risk, tire piles provide harborage for vermin and a breeding ground for  that may carry diseases.  of scrap tires pollutes ravines, woods, deserts, and empty lots; which has led many states to pass scrap tire regulations requiring proper management. Tire amnesty day events, in which community members can deposit a limited number of waste tires free of charge, can be funded by state scrap tire programs, helping decrease illegal dumping and improper storage of scrap tires.\nTire storage and recycling are sometimes linked with illegal activities and lack of .\nAlthough tires are usually burnt, not recycled, efforts are continuing to find value. Tires can be reclaimed into, among other things, the hot melt , typically as  modifier\u2014recycled asphalt pavement (CRM\u2014RAP), and as an aggregate in   Efforts have been made to use recycled tires as raw material for new tires, but such tires may integrate recycled materials no more than 5% by weight, and tires that contain recycled material are inferior to new tires, suffering from reduced tread life and lower traction. Tires have also been cut up and used in garden beds as bark mulch to hold in the water and to prevent weeds from growing. Some \"green\" buildings, both private and public, have been made from old tires.\n can be used to reprocess the tires into , oils, solid residue (char), and low-grade , which cannot be used in tire manufacture. A pyrolysis method which produces  and high-grade carbon black has been suggested.\nOld tires can be used as an alternative fuel in the manufacturing of , a key ingredient in concrete. Whole tires are commonly introduced into , by rolling them into the upper end of a preheater kiln, or by dropping them through a slot midway along a long wet kiln. In either case, the high gas temperatures (1000\u20131200\u00a0\u00b0C) cause almost instantaneous, complete and smokeless combustion of the tire. Alternatively, tires are chopped into 5\u201310\u00a0mm chips, in which form they can be injected into a precalciner combustion chamber.  Some iron input is required in manufacturing cement, so the iron content of steel-belted tires is beneficial to the process.\nTires can be reused in many ways, although most used tires are burnt for their  value. In a 2003 report cited by the U.S. , it is stated that markets (\"both recycling and beneficial use\") existed for 80.4% of scrap tires, about 233 million tires per year. Assuming 22.5 pounds (10.2\u00a0kg) per tire, the 2003 report predicts a total weight of about 2.62\u00a0million tonnes (2,580,000 long tons; 2,890,000 short tons) from tires.\nNew products derived from waste tires generate more economic activity than  or other low multiplier production, while reducing waste stream without generating excessive pollution and emissions from recycling operations.\nThe  method for recycling used tires is a technique which heats whole or shredded tires in a reactor vessel containing an oxygen-free atmosphere. In the reactor the rubber is softened after which the rubber polymers . \nThese smaller molecules eventually  and exit from the reactor.  These vapors can be burned directly to produce power or condensed into an oily type liquid, generally used as a . Some molecules are too small to condense.  They remain as a gas which can be burned as fuel. The minerals that were part of the tire, about 40% by weight, are removed as solid .  When performed properly, the  process is a clean operation and produces little emissions or waste; however, concerns about  due to  as is the case with  has been documented.\nThe properties of the gas, liquid, and solid output are determined by the type of feed-stock used and the process conditions. For instance whole tires contain fibers and steel. Shredded tires have most of the steel and sometimes most of the fiber removed. Processes can be either batch or continuous. The energy required to drive the  of the rubber include using directly fired fuel (like a ), electrical induction (like an electrically heated oven) or by  (like a microwave oven). Sometimes a  is used to accelerate the decomposition. The choice of feed-stock and process can affect the value of the finished products.\nThe historical issue of tire pyrolysis has been the solid mineral stream, which accounts for about 40% of the output. The  can be removed from the solid stream with magnets for recycling. The remaining solid material, often referred to as \"\", has had little or no value other than possibly as a low grade .  Char is the destroyed remains of the original  used to reinforce and provide abrasion resistance to the tire. The solid stream also includes the minerals used in  manufacturing. This high volume component of tire pyrolysis is a major impediment, although this theme continues to be a source of innovation.\nAside from recycling old tires, the old tire can be put to a new use.\nOld tires are sometimes converted into a  for play.  The innovative use allows for an easy way to find a purpose for an existing old tire not suitable for road use.\nUsed tires are also employed as exercise equipment for athletic programs such as . One classic conditioning drill that hones players' speed and agility is the \"Tire Run\" where tires are laid out side by side, with each tire on the left a few inches ahead of the tire on the right in a zigzag pattern.  Athletes then run through the tire pattern by stepping in the center of each tire.  The drill forces athletes to lift their feet above the ground higher than normal to avoid tripping. Other athletic uses include tire flipping (tractor or large truck tires typically used) or for upper cardio conditioning by hitting a tire repetitively with a sledge hammer.\nRe-purposed tires can also be harnessed as an affordable alternative building material used in the framework of rammed Earth thermal mass dwellings. This is beneficial across scales of production such as individually sustainable housing.\nRows of stacks of tyres are often used as barriers in motor racing circuits as a method of dissipating kinetic energy over a longer period of time during a crash, comparatively to striking a less malleable material such as a concrete or steel wall.\nMany cattle farmers re-purpose old tractor tires as water troughs for their cattle by placing them over natural springs or by piping stream water into them.  These tires contain the water and allow it to pool for the cattle without any additional interaction from the farmer.  Most farmers also include a drainage pipe near the top or in the center of the tire so excess water can drain off to prevent overflow and erosion around the outside of the tire where the cattle would be.\nDue to their  and other pollutant content, tires pose a risk for the  of toxins  the  when placed in . Research has shown that very little leaching occurs when shredded tires are used as light fill material; however, limitations have been put on use of this material; each site should be individually assessed determining if this product is appropriate for given conditions.\nFor both above and below water table applications, the preponderance of evidence shows that TDA (tire derived aggregate, or shredded tires) will not cause primary drinking water standards to be exceeded for metals.    Moreover, TDA is unlikely to increase levels of metals with primary drinking water standards above naturally occurring background levels.\n"},

It is estimated that about 30 million liters of paint is sold in Alberta each year. On average, 5 to 10 percent of this ends up as waste, which can pose environmental and health risks if disposed of improperly. Paint contains many components that have great potential for reuse, recycling and recovery. The Paint Recycling Alberta program enables these products to be handled and recycled in an environmentally safe manner, reducing their impact on the environment.  The program is funded through environmental fees charged on the sale of new paint in Alberta. The fees are put into a dedicated fund that can only be used to manage the paint recycling program. \nThe paint is sorted into different streams and sent to registered processors to be recycled into new paint, used in other products or in energy recovery, or sent for proper disposal if necessary. Any processor that receives paint must be registered with the Paint Recycling Program and meet all applicable environmental, transportation, health & safety, and local requirements. \n (CEL) located in Calgary, Alberta, became a key part in 2008 of the new Alberta Paint Stewardship program which significantly increased the recycling of unused latex paint from across the province of Alberta.  Calibre Environmental Ltd. currently processes about 1.6 million kilograms of latex paint annually, which equates to the successful recycling of one million litres of quality latex paint per year.\nIn the UK reusable leftover paint can be donated to , a national network of paint reuse schemes. The network comprises local schemes run by not-for-profit organisations, local authorities or waste management companies, in the Community RePaint network. The schemes collect surplus paint from trade sources i.e. painters, decorators, retailers, manufacturers, and/or leftover paint donated by householders at council household waste and recycling centres (also known as tips). The paint is then sorted by staff and volunteers before being redistributed to local charities, community groups, families and individuals in need.

Nearly 2.5 billion people in developing countries live on less than $2 a day. For them, paint is very expensive. In these settings, it is very difficult for families to secure sufficient income for their basic needs (including but not limited to: food, medicine, water, clothes, school supplies, and shelter). When making consumption choices that involve spending on their basic needs there is nothing left to spend on paint. The paint shortage affects many other areas of the world, where communities lack even the most basic need and materials to uplift their people. For the world\u2019s poorest communities, home isn\u2019t just where the heart is.

The blue box system and variations of it remain in place in hundreds of cities around the world.\nToday, many municipalities operate blue box programs that accept all forms of paper materials, most plastic packaging, glass containers,  and . For example, the City of Greater Napanee accepts:\nThe municipality provides the blue boxes to residents in areas serviced by the recycling program. This usually includes all  and townhouse units receiving . Tenants of  typically do not use blue boxes but rather deposit their household recyclable materials in larger containers made available.\nAn organization called Pollution Probe was formed in 1969 by students and faculty at the  and in 1971, members published a report stressing the need for recycling. Also in 1971, the Canadian Federal Government first established a national Department of the Environment, known as , with Environmental protection as one of its priorities. The Ontario government followed suit with a Ministry of the Environment in 1972.\nJack McGinnis of Toronto helped form a community-based non-profit organization called \"Is Five\" Foundation in 1974. Named for a book of poetry by , Is Five organized Canada\u2019s first multi-material curbside pickup of recyclable material for 80,000 households of  neighbourhood of east . In 1977, Jack McGinnis and Derek Stephenson created a private consulting company, Resource Integration Systems (RIS) to advise governments in the field of recycling and waste management.\nThat same year, in response to the , Rick Findlay was hired by Environment Canada\u2019s Federal Facilities Program to develop and coordinate a resource conservation program primarily for federal government facilities in Ontario. The program was expected to improve environmental quality and reduce energy demand. The Federal Facilities Program sought advice on a recycling pilot program for  and eventually made contact with RIS. RIS experimented with a variety of techniques to improve the performance recycling and found that participation rates were significantly higher when residents could simply drop their recycling in a plastic box. Initially, the project at CFB Borden used milk crates borrowed from a local grocery store. Participation was likely encouraged by a standing order from the Base Commander to recycle.\nMeanwhile, a student and a volunteer at a / office of Pollution Probe, Eric Hellman organized \"Garbage Fest 77\" in Kitchener to raise awareness about the consequences of garbage production. McGinnis was invited to speak about his experiences with the CFB Borden program. Hellman also requested a representative from Superior Sanitation (later to be Laidlaw Waste Systems Ltd), the local garbage collection contractor, and an employee named Nyle Ludolph attended Garbage Fest. After meeting McGinnis at the festival, Ludolph became an enthusiastic recycler at his own home and helped increase Laidlaw\u2019s presence in recycling. Nyle managed \"Total Recycling Systems\", a subsidiary of Superior Sanitation/Laidlaw.\nIn 1978, Jack McGinnis and Eric Hellman and others met in the basement of the Trinity United Church on Yonge Street in Toronto and created the Recycling Council of Ontario.\nIn 1981, after close cooperation with Nyle Ludolph, RIS submitted a proposal to Laidlaw to collect and recycle materials at the curbside for a pilot project in Kitchener, Ontario. Lillian and Ken Croal of Kitchener were the first to use and receive a blue box.  RIS designed the program, and Total Recycling had the responsibility to handle all operations. The Kitchener project included 1,500 households and was tested with four different approaches to recycling:\nThe blue box recycling system was proposed to be included as an included \u201cextra\u201d to the regular waste management contract. Laidlaw was successful in obtaining the waste management contract for Kitchener, and the blue box system had its commercial launch. RIS came up with the slogan \u201cWe Recycle\u201d, which was applied to every box that went out in Kitchener. Various reasons why the boxes were coloured blue, as opposed to some other colour have been posited: the facts are that RIS felt they looked best and were most visible in blue. It was also a colour that was suitable in terms of withstanding damage from ultraviolet light.\nThe four recycling approaches were monitored by RIS for one year and the blue box was decided as the most effective. The \u201ctest project\u201d continued to run however, and people who did not have the blue boxes began requesting them. Laidlaw received many letters from residents expressing support for the program and for it to continue. The blue box program was implemented citywide in 1983, with Laidlaw providing the extra investment in additional boxes and trucks and handling equipment even though it was not required by their waste management contract with the City. Participation rates ran at 85 percent, and the program was regarded as a success.\nIn 1984 the Citywide contract for Kitchener went out to public bid, as previously scheduled. City staff simply followed previous procedures \u2013 i.e., no specific requirement to offer recycling services was included in bid documents. Laidlaw chose to submit a bid that included continuation of the blue box service while their competitors, mainly large US-based firms, did not. One such competitor submitted a bid that was about $400,000 lower than the one from Laidlaw. The Council meeting where the decision was made was filled with local citizens, especially students, asking their City to support the blue box. The City did, voting to take the blue box bid, not the low bid.\nIn 1985, Laidlaw won the bid for recycling in the City of Mississauga and introduced the second commercial blue box program in Ontario in June 1986, the largest recycling effort in North America.\nBetween 1997 and 1999, Laidlaw, Inc. exited the solid waste business after incurring heavy losses through its investments in  and Greyhound Lines. After almost 20 years of expansion, Laidlaw Inc. filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in June 2001.\nCurrently in Ontario, Canada industry compensates municipalities for approximately 50% of the net costs to operate the blue box program.\nThe blue box system and variations of it remain in place in hundreds of cities around the world.\n"},

Recyclers consider electronic waste a \"rapidly expanding\" issue. In the United States, an estimated 70% of heavy metals in  comes from discarded electronics, while electronic waste represents only 2% of America's trash in landfills.\nMobile phones are \"considered hazardous waste\" in California; many chemicals in such phones leach from landfills into the groundwater system. Environmental advocacy group  claims that the soldering of the  battery into its handset hinders its being recycled. It also states that its scientists found toxic  on iPhone cables, and it holds that this contravenes  Proposition 65, which requires warning labels on products exposing consumers to phthalates.\nBecause the U.S. has not ratified the  or its , and has no domestic laws forbidding the export of toxic waste, the  estimates that about 80% of the electronic waste directed to recycling in the U.S. does not get recycled there at all, but is put on  and sent to countries such as China.  in the  region of , and  and  in , have electronic waste processing areas.\nHumans toss millions of cell phones each year in favor of newer technology\u2014and all those discarded phones may be taking a toll on the environment. Electronic scrap accounts for 70% of the overall toxic waste currently found in landfills in the U.S.A. According to the  (EPA), 141 million mobile phones were discarded in 2009 and only 12 million of those were collected for recycling.\nA cell phone's shelf life is only about 24 months for the average user.  This means that newer cell phone models are constantly put up on the market to replace older ones. This is as a result of the rapid progression of technology in the mobile industry. According to Matt Ployhar of , the industry is rapidly evolving, possibly even at \u201c pace or faster.\u201d  This means that newer cell phone models are continually on the rise of consumerism and more outdated models are likely to end up in landfills.\nMost cell phones contain precious metals and plastics that can be recycled to save energy and resources that would otherwise be required to mine or manufacture. When placed in a landfill, these materials can pollute the air and contaminate soil and drinking water. Cell phone coatings are typically made of , which is a toxic chemical that can result in adverse health effects when exposed to it in . The circuit board on cell phones can be made of , , lead, , , , , and other raw materials that would require significant resources to mine and manufacture.  This is why it is important to recycle old cell phones and source these increasingly scarce materials whenever possible.\nElectronic waste (e-waste) is a global problem; especially since many developed countries, including the U.S., ship their discarded electronic devices to . Oftentimes, the e-waste is improperly dismantled and burned, producing toxic emissions harmful to waste site workers, children, and nearby communities. Therefore, it is important for cell phone users to dispose of and recycle their devices responsibly and ethically.\nMobile phones currently pose a huge problem for numerous countries around the world. Manufacturers and agencies are slowly adapting new programs in an effort to curtail the amount of waste that has been rising over the years.\n currently has a national recycling program that was established under the name of MobileMuster. This program originated in 1998 after a successful recycling trial in one of their states. Currently, its main focus is centered around mobile phones, batteries and any related accessories. They collaborate with over 1,400 retailers, local councils, government agencies and businesses in their recycling efforts. In 2005 MobileMuster launched a campaign that gathered statistical data showing 46% of the Australian population was aware of the option to recycle their mobile devices and its accessories. The greatest benefit that arose from this research was the simple fact that raising public awareness of a recycling program actually lead to a large spike in the number of devices being recycled. In March 2006, awareness had increased to 54%. By the end of June more than 590,000 devices and 1.5 million batteries had been collected by MobileMuster. This amounts to roughly 367 tons of material, which is the equivalent to a 16% increase in the number of devices over the span of a year. Today, they are placing a heavy emphasis on not only recycling phones but rather reusing them. The reasoning behind this is that reusing leads to a decreased amount of resources being extracted from the environment, therefore minimizing the impact.\nIt was originally predicted that volumes for the US mobile phone recycling industry would see a notable increase until at least 2019, due to an upturn in mobile phone ownership and therefore a larger base of phones would be available for recycling. However the amount of ownership has succeeded most historic industry expectations - approximately 150 million mobile phones are discarded each year in the USA. Approximately 17  of copper and 0.3 tonnes of silver can be recovered per 1 million devices recycled. A 'marginal' amount of gold and palladium can also be extracted.\nA report released in early 2014 found that when it comes to mobile phone recycling programs, cash is the single biggest incentive for consumers in recycling phones. As more people became aware of the monetary value of their old cell phones and other small electronics such as tablets, comparison websites showing users the latest buying prices grew in popularity. The first cell phone buying comparison website to launch in North America  SellCell.com launched in 2008 and is the US's largest mobile phone and tablet comparison site for consumers and businesses that want to trade-in their old mobile phone tablet. The comparison site have seen over 2 million phones worth over $250 million sold through them since 2008! They also offer a   \nThe first mobile phone recycling company in the U.S. was , which was founded in 1991 when there were only 16 million mobile subscribers worldwide; it went bankrupt in 2013.\nBoth the  and mainland Europe have a significant problem with . Researchers at Plymouth University found that for each mobile phone produced, 15kg of ore needs to be mined, including 7kg of high-grade gold ore, 1kg of typical copper ore, 750g of typical tungsten ore and 200g of typical nickel ore. In the UK, only around 12% of all mobile phones that have been sold have gone on to be recycled.\nMobile phones have value well after their intended use. Yet the value of these phones to recyclers is marginal and relies on high volume to become profitable. The  of recycled cell phones is split into two categories; refurbished units that are resold to end users and phones that have no value to retail consumers that are recycled for their precious metals.\nThe  published a study in 2010 on the subject called, \"Economics of Cell Phone Reuse and Recycling\" that states the value of reused and recycled cell phones. In 2006, according to the study the average cost for  cell phone refurbishers , PaceButler and RMS was $2.10 while the average revenue from said phones was $17. Of the two recycling methods, refurbishment of cell phones is significantly more profitable than recycling the internal parts.\nThe study also describes the value of all precious metals inside of cell phones as well as the cost of extracting said metals. The average cost in 2006 to extract the precious metals for the U.S. cell phone recycling company ECS Refining was $.18 while the average revenue from the recycled metals was $.75. With a profit margin significantly smaller than refurbished units, this method of gaining economic value from the recycling of cell phones is significantly more volume dependent. The most valuable precious metal in cell phones is Gold which is used in the unit's microprocessor. This precious metals percentage of the total mass of phones has constantly decreased over time. From 1992 to 2006,  as a percentage of total mass of cell phones dropped from .06% to .03%. There is a significant amount of volume in the U.S. market with Americans in 2009 throwing away on average 350,000 cell phones a day but with thinning margins, volume starts to become irrelevant.\nTherefore, the economic  for recycling the precious metals in cell phones is decreasing in the United States as manufacturers look for more cost effective ways to produce cell phones.

In the recycling industry, this is referred to as \"post-consumer PET.\"  Many local governments and waste collection agencies have started to collect post-consumer PET separately from other household waste. Besides that there is  in some countries which also applies to PET bottles.\nIt is debatable whether exporting circulating resources that damages the domestic recycling industry is acceptable or not. In Japan, overseas market pressure led to a significant cost reduction in the domestic market. The cost of the plastics other than PET bottles remained high.\nWhen the PET bottles are returned to an authorized redemption center, or to the original seller in some jurisdictions, the deposit is partly or fully refunded to the redeemer. In both cases the collected post-consumer PET is taken to recycling centres known as  (MRF) where it is sorted and separated from other materials such as metal, objects made out of other rigid plastics such as , , , flexible plastics such as those used for bags (generally low density ), drink cartons, glass, and anything else which is not made out of PET.\nPost-consumer PET is often sorted into different colour fractions: transparent or uncoloured PET, blue and green coloured PET, and the remainder into a mixed colours fraction.  The emergence of new colours (such as amber for plastic beer bottles) further complicates the sorting process for the recycling industry.\nThe sorted post-consumer PET waste is crushed, pressed into bales and offered for sale to recycling companies.  Colourless/light blue post-consumer PET attracts higher sales prices than the darker blue and green fractions.  The mixed color fraction is the least valuable due simply to the fact unlike aluminium, there are few standards when it comes to the coloration of PET. Unlike clear varieties, PET with unique color characteristics are only useful to the particular manufacturer that uses that color.  For , colored PET bottles are therefore  a cause for concern as they can impact the financial viability of recycling such materials. The Plastics Recyclers Europe (PRE, Brussels, Belgium), that an upsurge in a variety of PET colors would be a problem because no market exists for them in the current recycling climate. \nThe further treatment process includes crushing, washing, separating and drying.\nRecycling companies further treat the post-consumer PET by shredding the material into small fragments.  These fragments still contain residues of the original content, shredded paper labels and plastic caps.  These are removed by , resulting in pure PET fragments, or \"PET flakes\".  PET flakes are used as the raw material for a range of products that would otherwise be made of . Examples include polyester fibres (a base material for the production of , , , etc.), polyester sheets, , or back into PET bottles.\nMelt filtration is typically used to remove contaminants from polymer melts during the extrusion process. There is a mechanical separation of the contaminants within a machine called a \u2018screen changer\u2019. A typical system will consist of a steel housing with the filtration medium contained in moveable pistons or slide plates that enable the processor to remove the screens from the extruder flow without stopping production. The contaminants are usually collected on woven wire screens which are supported on a stainless steel plate called a \u2018breaker plate\u2019\u2014a strong circular piece of steel drilled with large holes to allow the flow of the polymer melt. For the recycling of polyester it is typical to integrate a screen changer into the extrusion line. This can be in a pelletizing, sheet extrusion or strapping tape extrusion line.\nPET polymer is very sensitive to hydrolytic degradation, resulting in severe reduction in its molecular weight, thereby adversely affecting its subsequent melt processability. Therefore, it is essential to dry the PET flakes or granules to a very low moisture level prior to melt extrusion.\nPET must be dried to <100 parts per million (ppm) moisture and maintained at this moisture level to minimize hydrolysis during melt processing.\nDehumidifying Drying - These types of dryers circulate hot and de-humidified dry air onto the resin, suck the air back, dry it and then pump again in a closed loop operation. This process reduces moisture level in the PET down to 50ppm or lower. The efficiency of moisture removal depends on the air dew point. If the air dew point is not good, then some moisture remains in the chips and cause IV loss during processing.\nInfrared Drying polyester pellets and flakes - A new type of dryer has been introduced in recent years, using Infrared drying (IRD). Due to the high rate of energy transfer with IR heating in combination with the specific wavelength used, the energy costs involved with these systems can be greatly reduced, along with the size. Polyester can be dried and amorphous flake crystallized and dried within only about 15 minutes down to a moisture level of approx. 300ppm in one step, and down to <50 ppm using a buffer hopper to complete the drying in typically under 1 hour\nWorldwide, approximately 7.5 million tons of PET were collected in 2011.  This gave 5.9 million tons of flake.  In 2009 3.4 million tons were used to produce fibre, 500,000 tons to produce bottles, 500,000 tons to produce  sheet for thermoforming, 200,000 tons to produce strapping tape and 100,000 tons for miscellaneous applications.\n, the European  that fosters the collection and recycling of PET, reported that in Europe alone, 1.6 million tonnes of PET bottles were collected in 2011 - more than 51% of all bottles. After exported bales were taken into account, 1.12 million tons of PET flake were produced. 440,000 tons were used to produce fibres, 283,000 tons to produce more bottles, 278,000 tons to produce APET sheets, 102,000 tons for strapping tape and 18,000 tons for miscellaneous applications. (Source: PCI for Petcore and EuPR)\nIn 2008 the amount of post-consumer PET bottles collected for recycling and sold in the United States was approx. 1.45 billion pounds.\nIn 2012, 81% of the PET bottles sold in  were recycled.\nIn 2018, 90% of the PET bottles sold in  were recycled. The high rate of recycling is mostly result of the deposit system in use. The law demands a tax of 0,51 \u20ac/l for bottles and cans that are not part of a refund system. Thus encouraged by the law, products are included to have a 10\u00a2 to 40\u00a2 deposit that is paid to the recycler of the can or bottle.\nIncreasing energy prices may increase the volume of recycling PET bottles. In Europe, the EU Waste Framework Directive mandates that by 2020 there should be 50% recycling or reuse of plastics from household streams.\nIn the United States the recycling rate for PET packaging was 31.2% in 2013, according to a report from The National Association for PET Container Resources (NAPCOR) and The Association of Postconsumer Plastic Recyclers (APR). A total of 1,798 million pounds was collected and 475 million pounds of recycled PET used out of a total of 5,764 million pounds of PET bottles.\n\nPET bottles are also recycled as-is (re-used) for various purposes, including for use in school projects, and for use in  in , in which empty PET bottles are filled with water and left in the sun to allow disinfection by . PET is useful for this purpose because many other materials (including window glass) that are transparent to visible light are opaque to ultraviolet radiation.\nA novel use is as a building material in third-world countries. According to online sources, the bottles, in a labor-intensive process, are filled with sand, then stacked and either mudded or cemented together to form a wall. Some of the bottles can be filled instead with air or water, to admit light into the structure.\n"},

In the United States, about 620 million fluorescent lamps are discarded annually; proper recycling of a lamp prevents emission of mercury into the environment, and is required by most states for commercial facilities. The primary advantage of recycling is diversion of mercury from landfill sites, but the actual scrap value of the materials salvaged from a discarded lamp is often insufficient to offset the cost of recycling.\nThe amount of mercury in a fluorescent lamp varies from 3 to 46\u00a0mg, depending on lamp size and age. Newer lamps contain less mercury and the 3\u20134\u00a0mg versions are sold as low-mercury types. A typical 2006-era 4\u00a0ft (122\u00a0cm) T-12 fluorescent lamp (i.e. F34T12) contains about 5  of mercury. In early 2007, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association in the US announced that \"Under the voluntary commitment, effective April 15, 2007, participating manufacturers will cap the total mercury content in CFLs under 25 watts at 5 milligrams (mg) per unit. CFLs that use 25 to 40 watts of electricity will have total mercury content capped at 6\u00a0mg per unit.\"\nOnly a few tenths of a milligram of mercury are required to maintain the vapor, but lamps must include more mercury to compensate for the part of mercury absorbed by internal parts of the lamp and no longer available to maintain the arc. Manufacturing processes have been improved to reduce the handling of liquid mercury during manufacture and improve accuracy of mercury dosing.\nMercury-free discharge lamps have considerably lower production of visible light, reduced to about half; thus, mercury remains an essential component of efficient fluorescent lamps.\n\nA broken fluorescent tube will release its mercury content. Safe cleanup of broken fluorescent bulbs differs from cleanup of conventional broken glass or incandescent bulbs, avoiding the use of vacuum cleaners, in favour of sticky tape to recover small particles, and ensuring that fans and air conditioning are turned off. Approximately 99% of the mercury is typically contained in the , especially on lamps that are near their end of life.\nLamps made up to the 1940s used toxic  compounds, which were implicated in the deaths of factory workers.  Today it is very unlikely that one would encounter any such lamps.\nOther toxic elements such as , , and  were formerly used in phosphor manufacture.  Modern  phosphors resemble the chemistry of . The  doped phosphors are not known to be harmful.\nWhen a modern fluorescent tube is discarded, the main concern is the mercury, which is a significant toxic pollutant. One way to avoid releasing mercury into the environment is to combine it with  to form , which will prevent vapor release and is insoluble in water. One advantage of sulfur is its low cost. The reaction is shown with the equation:\nHg +  S \u2192    HgS\nThe easiest way to combine sulfur and mercury is to cover a group of fluorescent tubes with sulfur dust (sometimes called \"\") and to break the tubes; when the glass fragments are put into a bag to continue with the reaction, the mercury will combine with sulfur without any other action. The glass can be recycled where an appropriate facility exists. A quantity of 25 kilograms (55\u00a0lb) of dust sulfur is enough for 1000 tubes.\nThe disposal of phosphor and mercury toxins from spent tubes can be an . Governmental regulations in many areas require special disposal of fluorescent lamps separate from general and household wastes. For large commercial or industrial users of fluorescent lights, recycling services are available in many nations, and may be required by regulation. In some areas, recycling is also available to consumers.\nSpent fluorescent lamps are typically packaged prior to transport to a recycling facility in one of three ways: boxed for bulk pickup, by using a prepaid lamp recycling box, or crushed onsite before pickup. A fluorescent lamp crusher can attach directly to a disposal drum and isolate the dust and mercury vapor. In some states, drum-top crushers and end-user crushing of lamps are not allowed. Disposal methods are regulated at both the state and federal level.\nProper recycling of fluorescent lamps can reduce risk of human exposure to mercury. Companies that recycle spent fluorescent lamps include Air Cycle Corporation; Midwest Lamp Recycling, Inc.; Mercury Technologies of Minnesota, Inc.; USA Lamp & Ballast Recycling, Inc; Waste Management; and Veolia.\n"},

Companies may find it cost-effective in the short term to sell outdated computers to less developed countries with lax regulations. It is commonly believed that a majority of surplus laptops are routed to . The high value of working and reusable laptops, computers, and components (e.g. ) can help pay the cost of transportation for many worthless commodities. Laws governing the exportation of waste electronics are put in place to govern recycling companies in developed countries which ship waste to Third World countries. However, concerns about the impact of e-recycling on human health, the health of recycling workers and environmental degradation remain. For example, due to the lack of strict regulations in developing countries, sometimes workers smash old products, propelling toxins on to the ground, contaminating the soil and putting those who do not wear shoes in danger. Other procedures include burning away wire insulation and acid baths to resell circuit boards. These methods pose environmental and health hazards, as toxins are released into the air and acid bath residue can enter the water supply.\nIn , the first  recycling system was implemented in 1991, beginning with collection of old refrigerators; over the years, all other electric and electronic devices were gradually added to the system. The established producer responsibility organization is SWICO, mainly handling information, communication, and organization technology. The  implemented a similar system in February 2003, under the  (WEEE Directive, 2002/96/EC).\nPan European adoption of the Legislation was slow on take-up, with Italy and the United Kingdom being the final member states to pass it into law.  The success of the WEEE directive has varied significantly from state to state, with collection rates varying between 13 kilograms per capita per annum to as little as 1\u00a0kg per capita per annum.  Computers & electronic wastes collected from households within Europe are treated under the WEEE directive via Producer Compliance Schemes (whereby manufacturers of Electronics pay into a scheme that funds its recovery from household waste recycling centres (HWRCs)) and nominated Waste Treatment Facilities (known as Obligated WEEE).\nHowever, recycling of ex corporate Computer Hardware and associated electronic equipment falls outside the Producer Compliance Scheme (Known as non-obligated).  In the UK, Waste or obsolete corporate related computer hardware is treated via third party Authorized Treatment Facilities, who normally impose a charge for its collection and treatment.\nThe  considers a number of electronic waste bills, like the  introduced by Congressman  (D-CA). The main federal law governing solid waste is the  of 1976. It covers only CRTs, though state regulations may differ. There are also separate . On March 25, 2009, the House Science and Technology Committee approved funding for research on reducing electronic waste and mitigating environmental impact, regarded by sponsor  (-) as the first federal bill to directly address electronic waste.\nMany states have introduced legislation concerning recycling and reuse of computers or computer parts or other electronics. Most  address it from within the larger electronic waste issue.\nIn 2001, Arkansas enacted the Arkansas Computer and Electronic Solid Waste Management Act, which requires that state agencies manage and sell surplus computer equipment, establishes a computer and electronics recycling fund, and authorizes the Department of Environmental Quality to regulate and/or ban the disposal of computer and electronic equipment in Arkansas landfills.\nThe recently passed  distributes grants to universities, government labs and private industries for research in developing projects in line with e-waste recycling and refurbishment.\nIn , sellers and manufacturers of certain electronics (such as televisions and ) are required to recycle them. This is covered by at least two legislations: the Law for the Promotion of Effective Utilization of Resources (LPUR); and, the Law for the Recycling of Specified Kinds of Home Appliances (LRHA). The former, which was passed in 2001, encouraged manufacturers to voluntarily help recycle goods while the LRHA, which was adopted in 2009, required more recycling efforts by both consumers and manufacturers of home appliances. However, no legislation exists to cover the recycling of computer or cellphone-related wastes.\nIt is required in  and  that sellers and manufacturers of electronics be responsible for recycling 75% of their used products. In South Korea, some local governments have introduced recycling initiatives such as the case of , which launched its specialized e-waste recycling program. This includes the SR Center recycling facility, which takes apart and salvages materials from a fifth of the 10-ton e-waste that the city generates each year.\nAccording to a report by UNEP titled, \"Recycling \u2013 from E-Waste to Resources,\" the amount of e-waste being produced \u2013 including mobile phones and computers \u2013 could rise by as much as 500 percent over the next decade in some countries, such as India.\nOne theory is that increased regulation of electronic waste and concern over the environmental harm in mature economies creates an economic disincentive to remove residues prior to export.  Critics of trade in used electronics maintain that it is too easy for brokers calling themselves recyclers to export unscreened electronic waste to developing countries, such as China, India and parts of Africa, thus avoiding the expense of removing items like bad cathode ray tubes (the processing of which is expensive and difficult). The developing countries are becoming big dump yards of e-waste.  Proponents of international trade point to the success of  programs in other industries, where cooperation has led creation of sustainable jobs, and can bring affordable technology in countries where repair and reuse rates are higher.\nOrganizations like  have stepped in to own up the responsibility to collect and recycle e-waste at various locations in India.\nThanks to the National Environmental Management Act 1998 and National Environmental Management Waste Act 2008, any person in any position causing harm to the environment and failing to comply with the Waste Act could be fined R10 Million or put into jail or receive both penalties for their transgressions.\nConsumer recycling options consists of (see below) sale, donating computers directly to organizations in need, sending devices directly back to their original manufacturers, or getting components to a convenient recycler or refurbisher.\nIn the recycling process, TVs, monitors, mobile phones and computers are typically tested for reuse and repaired. If broken, they may be disassembled for parts still having high value if labour is cheap enough. Other e-waste is shredded to roughly 100\u00a0mm pieces and manually checked to separate out toxic batteries and  which contain poisonous metals. The remaining pieces are further shredded to ~10\u00a0mm and passed under a magnet to remove ferrous metals. An  ejects non-ferrous metals, which are sorted by density either by a centrifuge or vibrating plates. Precious metals can be dissolved in acid, sorted, and smelted into ingots. The remaining glass and plastic fractions are separated by density and sold to re-processors. TVs and monitors must be manually disassembled to remove either toxic lead in CRTs or the mercury in flat screens.\nCorporations face risks both for incompletely destroyed data and for improperly disposed computers. In the UK, some recycling companies use a specialized WEEE-registered contractor to dispose IT equipment and electrical appliances, who disposes it safely and legally.\nIn America, companies are liable for compliance with regulations even if the recycling process is outsourced under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Companies can mitigate these risks by requiring waivers of liability, audit trails, certificates of data destruction, signed confidentiality agreements, and random audits of information security. The National Association of Information Destruction is an international trade association for data destruction providers.\nOnline auctions are an alternative for consumers willing to resell for cash less fees, in a complicated, self-managed, competitive environment where paid listings might not sell. Online classified ads can be similarly risky due to  scams and uncertainty.\nWhen researching computer companies before a computer purchase, consumers can find out if they offer recycling services. Most major computer manufacturers offer some form of recycling. At the user's request they may mail in their old computers, or arrange for pickup from the manufacturer.\n also offers free recycling, but only one of its \"national\" recycling programs is available nationally, rather than in one or two specific states. Hewlett-Packard also offers to pick up any computer product of any brand for a fee, and to offer a coupon against the purchase of future computers or components; it was the largest computer recycler in America in 2003, and it has recycled over 750,000,000 pounds (340,000,000\u00a0kg) of electronic waste globally since 1995. It encourages the shared approach of collection points for consumers and recyclers to meet.\nManufacturers often offer a free replacement service when purchasing a new PC.  and  take back old products when one buys a new one. Both refurbish and resell their own computers with a one-year warranty.\nMany companies purchase and recycle all brands of working and broken  and  from individuals and corporations. Building a market for recycling of desktop computers has proven more difficult than exchange programs for laptops,  and other smaller electronics. A basic business model is to provide a seller an instant online quote based on laptop characteristics, then to send a shipping label and prepaid box to the seller, to erase, reformat, and process the laptop, and to pay rapidly by cheque. A majority of these companies are also generalized  as well; organizations that recycle computers exclusively include , a laptop refurbisher in  that claims to be the first to buy laptops online, in 2001.\nWith the constant rising costs due to inflation, many families or schools do not have the sufficient funds available for computers to be utilized along with education standards. Families also impacted by disaster suffer as well due to the financial impact of the situation they have incurred. Many nonprofit organizations, such as , can be found locally as well as around the web and give detailed descriptions as to what methods are used for dissemination and detailed instructions on how to donate. The impact can be seen locally and globally, affecting thousands of those in need. In Canada non profit organizations engaged in computer recycling, such as The Electronic Recycling Association Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver, Winnipeg, Toronto, Montreal, Computers for Schools Canada wide, are very active in collecting and refurbishing computers and laptops to help the non profit and charitable sectors and schools.\nThe term  is a colloquial expression for using old or inferior hardware to fulfill computational tasks while handling reliability and availability on software level. It utilizes abstraction of computational resources via software, allowing hardware replacement at very low effort. Ease of replacement is hereby a corner point since hardware failures are expected at any time due to the condition of the underlying infrastructure. This paradigm became more widely used with the introduction of cluster orchestration software like  or , since large monolithic applications require reliability and availability on machine level whereas this kind of software is fault tolerant by design. Those orchestration tools also introduced fairly fast set-up processes allowing to use junkyard computing economically and even making this pattern applicable in the first place. Further use cases were introduced when  was getting more widely accepted. Infrastructure to execute  and  was needed which requires as much performance as possible while being extremely cost effective. From an economical and technological perspective, junkyard computing is only practicable for a small number of users or companies. It already requires a decent number of physical machines to compensate for hardware failures while maintaining the required reliability and availability. This implies a direct need for a matching underling infrastructure to house all the computers and servers. Scaling this paradigm is also quite limited due to the increasing importance of factors like power efficiency and maintenance efforts, making this kind of computing perfect for mid-sized applications.\nAlthough consumer electronics such as the radio have been popular since the 1920s, recycling was almost unheard of until the early 1990s. At the end of the 1970s the accelerating pace of domestic consumer electronics drastically shortened the lifespan of electronics such as TVs, VCRs and audio. New innovations appeared more quickly, making older equipment considered obsolete. Increased complexity and sophistication of manufacture made local repair more difficult. The retail market shifted gradually, but substantially from a few high-value items that were cherished for years and repaired when necessary, to short-lived items that were rapidly replaced owing to wear or simply fashion, and discarded rather than repaired. This was particularly evident in computing, highlighted by . In 1988 two severe incidents highlighted the approaching e-waste crisis. The cargo barge , was loaded with more than 14,000 tons of toxic ash from  which had been refused acceptance in  and . After sailing for 16 months, all the waste was dumped as \"topsoil fertiliser\" in Haiti and in the  by November 1988. In June 1988, a large illegal toxic waste dump which had been created by an Italian company was discovered. This led to the formation of the  to stem the flow of poisonous substances from developed countries in 1989.\nIn 1991, the first electronic waste recycling system was implemented in Switzerland, beginning with collection of old refrigerators but gradually expanding to cover all devices. The organisation SWICO handles the programme, and is a partnership between IT retailers.\nThe first publication to report the recycling of computers and electronic waste was published on the front page of the New York Times on April 14, 1993 by columnist Steve Lohr. It detailed the work of Advanced Recovery Inc., a small recycler, in trying to safely dismantle computers, even if most waste was landfilled. Several other companies emerged in the early 1990s, chiefly in Europe, where national 'take back' laws compelled retailers to use them.\nAfter these schemes were set up, many countries did not have the capacity to deal with the sheer quantity of e-waste they generated or its hazardous nature. They began to export the problem to developing countries without enforced environmental legislation. This is cheaper: the cost of recycling of computer monitors in the US is ten times more than in China. Demand in Asia for electronic waste began to grow when scrap yards found they could extract valuable substances such as copper, iron, silicon, nickel and gold, during the recycling process.\nThe Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive) became European Law in February 2003 and covers all aspects of recycling all types of appliance. This was followed by Electronic Waste Recycling Act, enshrined in Californian law in January 2005\nThe 2000s saw a large increase in both the sale of electronic devices and their growth as a waste stream: in 2002 e-waste grew faster than any other type of waste in the EU. This caused investment in modern, automated facilities to cope with the influx of redundant appliances.\n or \"E-waste\" is an initiative by the United States  (EPA) which refers to donations, reuse, shredding and general collection of used electronics. Generically, the term refers to the process of collecting, brokering, disassembling, repairing and recycling the components or metals contained in used or discarded electronic equipment, otherwise known as  (e-waste). \"E-cyclable\" items include, but are not limited to: televisions, computers, microwave ovens, vacuum cleaners, telephones and cellular phones, stereos, and VCRs and DVDs just about anything that has a cord, light or takes some kind of battery.\nInvestment in e-cycling facilities has been increasing recently due to technology's rapid rate of obsolescence, concern over improper methods, and opportunities for manufacturers to influence the secondary market (used and reused products). The higher metal prices is also having more recycling taking place. The controversy around methods stems from a lack of agreement over preferred outcomes.\nWorld markets with lower disposable incomes, consider 75% repair and reuse to be valuable enough to justify 25% disposal. Debate and certification standards may be leading to better definitions, though civil law contracts, governing the expected process are still vital to any contracted process, as poorly defined as \"e-cycling\".\nThe e-waste disposal occurring after processing for reuse, repair of equipment, and recovery of metals may be unethical or illegal when e-scrap of many kinds is transported overseas to developing countries for such processing. It is transported as if to be repaired and/or recycled, but after processing the less valuable e-scrap becomes e-waste/pollution there. Another point of view is that the net environmental cost must be compared to and include the mining, refining and extraction with its waste and pollution cost of new products manufactured to replace secondary products which are routinely destroyed in wealthier nations, and which cannot economically be repaired in older or obsolete products.  As an example of negative impacts of e-waste, pollution of groundwater has become so serious in areas surrounding China's landfills that water must be shipped in from 18 miles (29\u00a0km) away. However, mining of new metals can have even broader impacts on groundwater. Either thorough e-cycling processing, domestic processing or overseas repair, can help the environment by avoiding pollution. Such e-cycling can theoretically be a sustainable alternative to disposing of e-waste in landfills. In addition, e-cycling allows for the reclamation of potential , like  and , which requires less of those to be mined and lessens the potential money flow to militias and other exploitative actors in third-world that profit from mining them.\nSupporters of one form of \"required e-cycling\" legislation argue that e-cycling saves taxpayers money, as the financial responsibility would be shifted from the taxpayer to the manufacturers. Advocates of more simple legislation (such as landfill bans for e-waste) argue that involving manufacturers does not reduce the cost to consumers, if reuse value is lost, and the resulting costs are then passed on to consumers in new products, particularly affecting markets which can hardly afford new products. It is theorized that manufacturers who take part in e-cycling would be motivated to use fewer materials in the production process, create longer lasting products, and implement safer, more efficient recycling systems. This theory is sharply disputed and has never been demonstrated.\nThe critics of e-cycling are just as vocal as its advocates. According to the , e-cycling only raises the product and waste management costs of e-waste for consumers and limits innovation on the part of high-tech companies. They also believe that e-cycling facilities could unintentionally cause great harm to the environment. Critics claim that e-waste doesn't occupy a significant portion of total waste. According to a European study, only 4% of waste is electronic.\nAnother opposition to e-cycling is that many problems are posed in disassembly: the process is costly and dangerous because of the heavy metals of which the electronic products are composed, and as little as 1\u20135% of the original cost of materials can be retrieved. A final problem that people find is that  is all too common in regards to the disposal of electronic products. As the programs are legislated, creating winners and losers among e-cyclers with different locations and processes, it may be difficult to distinguish between criticism of e-cycling as a practice, and criticism of the specific legislated means proposed to enhance it.\nA hefty criticism often lobbed at reuse based recyclers is that people think that they are recycling their electronic waste, when in reality it is actually being exported to developing countries like China, India, and Nigeria.  For instance, at free recycling drives, \"recyclers\" may not be staying true to their word, but selling e-waste overseas or to parts brokers. Studies indicate that 50\u201380% of the 300,000 to 400,000 tons (270,000 to 360,000 tonnes) of e-waste is being sent overseas, and that approximately 2 million tons (1.8 million tonnes) per year go to U.S. landfills.\nAlthough not possible in all circumstances, the best way to e-cycle is to upcycle e-waste. On the other hand, the electronic products in question are generally manufactured, and repaired under warranty, in the same nations, which anti-reuse recyclers depict as primitive. Reuse-based e-recyclers believe that fair-trade incentives for export markets will lead to better results than domestic shredding. There has been a continued debate between export-friendly e-cycling and increased regulation of that practice.\nIn the European Union, debate regarding the export of e-waste has resulted in a significant amendment to the WEEE directive (January 2012) with a view to significantly diminishing the export of WEEE (untreated e-waste).  During debate in Strasburg, MEPs stated that \"53 million tonnes of WEEE were generated in 2009 but only 18% collected for recycling\" with the remainder being exported or sent to landfill. The Amendment, voted through by a unanimous 95% of representatives, removed the re-use (repair and refurbishmet) aspect of the directive and placed more emphasis upon recycling and recovery of precious metals and base metals.  The changes went further by placing the burden upon registered exporters to prove that used equipment leaving Europe was \"fit for purpose\".\nCurrently, pieces of government legislation and a number of grassroots efforts have contributed to the growth of e-cycling processes which emphasize decreased exports over increased reuse rates. The  was passed in California in 2003. It requires that consumers pay an extra fee for certain types of electronics, and the collected money be then redistributed to recycling companies that are qualified to properly recycle these products. It is the only state that legislates against e-waste through this kind of consumer fee; the other states' efforts focus on producer responsibility laws or waste disposal bans. No study has shown that per capita recovery is greater in one type of legislated program (e.g. California) versus ordinary waste disposal bans (e.g. Massachusetts), though recovery has greatly increased in states which use either method.\nAs of September, 2006, Dell developed the nation's first completely free recycling program, furthering the responsibilities that manufacturers are taking for e-cycling. Manufacturers and retailers such as Best Buy, Sony, and Samsung have also set up recycling programs. This program does not accept televisions, which are the most expensive used electronic item, and are unpopular in markets which must deal with televisions when the more valuable computers have been cherry picked.\nAnother step being taken is the recyclers\u2019 pledge of true stewardship, sponsored by the Computer TakeBack Campaign. It has been signed by numerous recyclers promising to recycle responsibly. Grassroots efforts have also played a big part in this issue, as they and other community organizations are being formed to help responsibly recycle e-waste. Other grassroots campaigns are Basel, the Computer TakeBack Campaign (co-coordinated by the Grassroots Recycling Network), and the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition. No study has shown any difference in recycling methods under the Pledge, and no data is available to demonstrate difference in management between \"Pledge\" and non-Pledge companies, though it is assumed that the risk of making false claims will prevent Pledge companies from wrongly describing their processes.\nMany people believe that the U.S. should follow the European Union model in regards to its management of e-waste, such as the , which was started in Sweden in 1990. In this program, a directive forces manufacturers to take responsibility for e-cycling; it also demands manufacturers' mandatory take-back and places bans on exporting e-waste to developing countries. British Columbia has more than 20 EPR programs under the Recycling Regulation legislation, which stops e-waste from being put into landfills and recycles them instead. There are more than 80 programs in Canada as of 2013.\nAnother longer-term solution is for computers to be composed of less dangerous products and many people disagree. No data has been provided to show that people who agree with the European model have based their agreement on measured outcomes or experience-based scientific method.\nE-waste presents a potential  threat to individuals and exporting countries.  that are not properly erased before the computer is disposed of can be reopened, exposing sensitive information.  numbers, private financial data, account information and records of  transactions can be accessed by most willing individuals. Organized criminals in Ghana commonly search the drives for information to use in local .\nGovernment contracts have been discovered on hard drives found in , Ghana. Multimillion-dollar agreements from United States security institutions such as the  (DIA), the  and  have all resurfaced in Agbogbloshie.\nThere are ways to ensure that not only hardware is destroyed but also the private data on the hard drive. Having customer data stolen, lost, or misplaced contributes to the ever-growing number of people who are affected by , which can cause corporations to lose more than just money. The image of a company that holds secure data, such as banks, law firms, pharmaceuticals, and credit corporations is also at risk. If a company's public image is hurt, it could cause consumers to not use their services and could cost millions in business losses and positive public relation campaigns. The cost of data breaches \"varies widely, ranging from $90 to $50,000 (under HIPAA's new HITECH amendment, that came about through the American Recovery and Revitalization act of 2009), as per customer record, depending on whether the breach is \u201clow-profile\u201d or \u201chigh-profile\u201d and the company is in a non-regulated or highly regulated area, such as banking or medical institutions.\u201d\nThere is also a major backlash from the consumer if there is a data breach in a company that is supposed to be trusted to protect their private information. If an organization has any consumer info on file, they must by law (Red Flags Clarification act of 2010) have written information protection policies and procedures in place, that serve to combat, mitigate, and detect vulnerable areas that could result in identity theft. The United States Department of Defense has published a standard to which recyclers and individuals may meet in order to satisfy HIPAA requirements.\nCountries have developed standards, aimed at businesses and with the purpose of ensuring the security of Data contained in 'confidential' computer media [NIST 800-88: US standard for Data Remanence][HMG CESG IS5, Baseline & Enhanced, UK Government Protocol for Data Destruction]. National Association for Information Destruction (NAID) \"is the international trade association for companies providing information destruction services. Suppliers of products, equipment and services to destruction companies are also eligible for membership. NAID's mission is to promote the information destruction industry and the standards and ethics of its member companies.\" There are companies that follow the guidelines from NAID and also meet all Federal EPA and local DEP regulations.\nThe typical process for computer recycling aims to securely destroy hard drives while still recycling the byproduct. A typical process for effective computer recycling:\nThe  (ADISA) publishes an  that covers all phases of the e-waste disposal process from collection to transportation, storage and sanitization's at the disposal facility. It also conducts periodic audits of disposal vendors.\n"},

Batteries contain a number of  and  chemicals and disposing of them by the same process as regular trash has raised concerns over  and .\nMost types of batteries can be recycled. However, some batteries are recycled more readily than others, such as  (nearly 90% are recycled) and  (because of the value and toxicity of their chemicals).  nickel\u2013cadmium (Ni-Cd), nickel metal hydride (Ni-MH), lithium-ion (Li-ion) and nickel\u2013zinc (Ni-Zn), can also be recycled. There is currently no cost-neutral recycling option available for disposable alkaline batteries, though consumer disposal guidelines vary by region.\nThese batteries include but are not limited to: ,  batteries,  batteries, industrial fork-lift batteries,  batteries, and commercial batteries. These can be regular , sealed lead\u2013acid, , or  batteries. These are recycled by grinding them, neutralizing the acid, and separating the polymers from the lead. The recovered materials are used in a variety of applications, including new batteries.\nThe lead in a  can be recycled. Elemental  is toxic and should therefore be kept out of the waste stream.\nMany cities offer battery recycling services for lead\u2013acid batteries. In some jurisdictions, including  and , a refundable deposit is paid on batteries. This encourages recycling of old batteries instead of abandonment or disposal with household waste. In the United States, about 99% of lead from used batteries is reclaimed.\nBusinesses that sell new  may also collect used batteries (or be required to do so by law) for recycling.  of neighborhoods has resulted from the process of recycling batteries.\nUsed most frequently in watches, toys, and some ,  contain a small amount of . Most jurisdictions regulate their handling and disposal to reduce the discharge of mercury into the environment. Silver oxide batteries can be recycled to recover the mercury.\n and  often contain among other useful metals high-grade  and  in addition to \u2013 depending on the active material \u2013 transition metals  and  as well as rare earths. To prevent a future shortage of cobalt, nickel, and lithium and to enable a sustainable life cycle of these technologies, recycling processes for lithium batteries are needed. These processes have to regain not only , , , and aluminium from spent battery cells, but also a significant share of lithium. Another potentially valuable and regainable materials are graphite and manganese. Recycling processes today recover approximately 25% to 96% of the materials of a lithium-ion battery cell, depending on the separation technology. In order to achieve this goal, several  are combined into complex process chains, especially considering the task to recover high rates of valuable materials with regard to involved safety issues.\nThese steps are:\nSpecific dangers associated with lithium-ion battery recycling processes are: electrical dangers, chemical dangers, burning reactions, and their potential interactions. A complicating factor is the water sensitivity: , a possible electrolyte material, will react with water to form ; cells are often immersed in a  to prevent this. Once removed, the jelly rolls are separated and the materials removed by ultrasonic agitation, leaving the electrodes ready for melting down and recycling.\nPouch cells are particularly easier to recycle in this way and some people already do this to salvage the copper despite the safety issues.\nAs of 2019, the recycling of Li-Ion batteries in most cases does not extract lithium since lithium-ion battery technology continuously changes and processes to recycle these batteries can thus be outdated in a couple of years. Another reason why it isn't being done on a large scale is because the extraction of lithium from old batteries is 5x more expensive than mined lithium. However, it is already being done on a small scale (by some companies), an industry in expectation of large quantities of disused batteries to come.\nEnergy saving and effective recycling solutions for  can reduce the  of the production of lithium-ion batteries significantly.\n designates button cell types. designates secondary types.All figures are percentages; due to rounding they may not add up to exactly 100.\n Figures for Q1 and Q2 2012.\nIn 2006, the EU passed the , one of the aims of which is a higher rate of battery recycling. The  directive states that at least 25% of all the EU's used batteries must be collected by 2012, and rising to no less than 45% by 2016, of which at least 50% must be recycled.\nIn early 2009,  took the initiative by setting up the Longue Hougue recycling facility, which, among other functions, offers a drop-off point for used batteries so they can be recycled off-island. The resulting publicity meant that a lot of people complied with the request to dispose of batteries responsibly.\nFrom April 2005 to March 2008, the UK non-governmental body WRAP conducted trials of battery recycling methods around the UK. The methods tested were: Kerbside, retail drop-off, community drop-off, postal, and hospital and fire station trials. The kerbside trials collected the most battery mass, and were the most well-received and understood by the public. The community drop-off containers which were spread around local community areas were also relatively successful in terms of mass of batteries collected. The lowest performing were the hospital and fire service trials (although these served their purpose very well for specialized battery types like hearing aid and smoke alarm batteries). Retail drop off trials were the second most effective (by volume) method but one of the least well received and used by the public. Both the kerbside and postal trials received the highest awareness and community support.\nHousehold batteries can be recycled in United Kingdom at council recycling sites as well as at some shops and shopping centres\u2014e.g., Dixons, Currys, The Link and PC World\nA scheme started in 2008 by a large retail company allowed household batteries to be posted free of charge in envelopes available at their shops. This scheme was cancelled at the request of the  because of hazardous industrial battery waste being sent as well as household batteries.\nAn EU directive on batteries that came into force in 2009 means producers must pay for the collection, treatment, and recycling of batteries. This has yet to be ratified into UK law however, so there is currently no real incentive for producers to provide the necessary services.\nFrom 1 February 2010, batteries can be recycled anywhere the \"Be Positive\" sign appears. Shops and online retailers that sell more than 32 kilograms of batteries a year must offer facilities to recycle batteries. This is equivalent to one pack of four  a day. Shops which sell this amount must by law provide recycling facilities as of 1 February 2010.\nIn Great Britain an increasing number of shops (Argos, Homebase, B&Q, Tesco, and Sainsbury's) are providing battery return boxes and cylinders for their customers.\nThe rechargeable battery industry has formed the  (RBRC), which operates a battery recycling program called  throughout the United States and Canada. RBRC provides businesses with prepaid  for rechargeable batteries of all types while consumers can drop off batteries at numerous participating collection centers. It claims that no component of any recycled battery eventually reaches a landfill. Other programs, such as the  program, offer a recycling option for all chemistries, including primary batteries such as alkaline and primary lithium.\nA study estimated battery recycling rates in Canada based on RBRC data. In 2002, it wrote, the collection rate was 3.2%. This implies that 3.2% of rechargeable batteries were recycled, and the rest were thrown in the trash. By 2005, it concluded, the collection rate had risen to 5.6%.\nIn 2009, Kelleher Environmental updated the study. The update estimates the following. \"Collection rate values for the 5 [and] 15-year hoarding assumptions respectively are: 8% to 9% for NiCd batteries; 7% to 8% for NiMH batteries; and 45% to 72% for lithium ion and lithium polymer batteries combined. Collection rates through the [RBRC] program for all end of life small sealed lead acid (SLA) consumer batteries were estimated at 10% for 5-year and 15-year hoarding assumptions.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_recycling", "title": "TextilerecyclingWikipedia", "body": " is the process of recovering fiber, yarn or fabric and reprocessing the textile material into useful products. Textile waste products are gathered from different sources and are then sorted and processed depending on their condition, composition, and resale value. The end result of this processing can vary, from the production of energy and chemicals to new articles of clothing.\nDue to a recent trend of over consumption and waste generation in global fashion culture, textile recycling has become a key focus of worldwide sustainability efforts. Globalization has led to a \"\" trend where clothes are considered by many consumers to be disposable due to their increasingly lower prices. The development of recycled technology has allowed the textile industry to produce vast amounts of products that deplete natural resources. Textile recycling techniques have been developed to cope with this increase of textile waste and new solutions are still being researched. Recently, certain clothing retailers have embraced this recycling effort and now publicly advertise products that are made of recycled textile material in accordance with shifting consumer expectations.\nMost materials used in textile recycling can be split into two categories: pre-consumer and post-consumer waste.\nPre-consumer or post-industrial waste consists of textile waste produced at the industrial stage of the production of textile material. Typically, these byproducts are produced by the textile, garment, cotton, and fiber industries and are repurposed by the furniture, home building, automotive, and other industries.\nPost-consumer or waste consists of discarded garments or household articles made from manufactured textiles. These unwanted articles are typically worn out or damaged. Some post-consumer waste is directed towards second hand retailers to be sold again. Some of this waste is collected in municipal collection bins, but the majority of this waste is found in landfills.\nThe clothing brand  introduced a program called \u201cClothes the Loop\u201d in 2013 that allows consumers to recycle post-consumer waste from any brand at any of their retail locations across the United States. This mirrors similar services by charity organizations such as  and  in the United States. Across the globe, charitable organizations and businesses such as  have created specially marked collection bins that allow the public to dispose of post-consumer waste so that it can be reused and repurposed.\nWhen recycling post-consumer textile waste, the sorting process is represented as a pyramid model in terms of the volume of material. At the base of the pyramid - and largest volume - is crude sorting, followed by exportation of second-hand clothing, conversion to new products, wiping and polishing cloths, landfill incineration for energy, and lastly diamonds. Typically within the pyramid model it is found that the volume of clothing items is inversely proportional to its monetary value, moreover meaning that despite diamonds making up the smallest sector (1-2%) of the sorting process they tend to be the most profitable.\nWithin crude sorting, waste items are often manually separated into distinct categories whilst also removing bulkier items, such as coats and blankets. The categories of textile waste may be divided based upon elements such as material, condition, quality, or clothing item such as shirts. Employees with the most expertise perform the most detail-oriented distinctions such as being able to distinguish cashmere from wool by touch. Along the crude sorting process, recycled textiles are also assigned categoric grades representing their commercial value based upon various fiber characteristics such as length, color, and the homogeneity of its chemical composition.\nThe exportation of second-hand clothing is a growing global market; the trade market value doubled between the years 2007 and 2012 based upon declared reports alone. The exportation trend is most commonly from Western countries to developing countries or those experiencing disaster relief, with the United States of America being responsible for 45% of the total volume of Western exportation. In Africa specifically, Western clothing is a high commodity that imports $61.7 million of sales annually and in Sub-Saharan Africa these exports account for over a third of the total purchased garments.\nClothing items that are not able to be resold may be converted into new products using their recycled fibers. Shoddy and mungo are the two main results of this process. Shoddy is one of the most historical examples of textile recycling and refers to creating yarn products from the old materials. Panipat in North India is one of the largest producers of shoddy yarn with over 300 mills, here the majority of shoddy is used to knit blankets. Mungo was invented after shoddy and refers to the process of using clippings of textiles when making wool, which is mostly exported to European countries due to the need for wool in the cooler temperatures and flammability regulations. Specific examples of products being produced using either shoddy or mungo include luxury blankets in Italy, fibers within US dollars, and the phenomena of sustainable fashion trends.\nTextiles that are deemed to be un-wearable during the sorting phase may be used to create wiping and polishing cloths that are called snakes, made from oleophilic and hydrophilic fibers. T-shirts are largely used when creating these cloths due to the naturally absorbent cotton fibers that have proven useful for cleaning up small oil spills within the oil industry.\nThe textile materials that are not found to have a viable market in any of the above categories are either sent to the landfill or are incinerated to produce electrical energy. Though incinerating municipal solid waste (MSW) is not yet feasible in the United States, it has been prolific in countries such as Denmark, Japan, and Switzerland where over two thirds of MSW is incinerated. In terms of calories, the energy values of burning MSW have been comparable with oil but there are still obstacles with increasing incineration efficiency and reducing harmful byproducts of the incineration such as noxious gases and ash.\nDiamonds make up the smallest sector of the sorting process, constituting the rare items of clothing that are considered collectibles and can be resold with a high profit margin. Diamonds are usually hunted and sold by small family businesses, the majority of these lie in Japan where consumers value Western brands such as Ralph Loren, Levi\u2019s. and Harley Davidson. Whereas, the smaller diamond markets in America place a higher value and priority on items such as Italian leather and French Couture.\nMechanical processing is the most commonly used technique to recycle textiles. Companies in the United States used about 7.6 million bales of cotton to manufacture textiles with each bale weighing 500 pounds. The cotton can be recycled through mechanical means after separating it from different materials. However, some plants can still process recycled material that is not purely made of cotton such as 98% cotton and 2% spandex. After an initial sorting, the raw material is further sorted by color to avoid re-dying and bleaching. Once done, the textile material is shredded and separated into fibers. The end product at this point is not usable yet and needs to be aligned before spinning. This process is known as . Now, the fibers are spun along with some virgin cotton fibers since recycled cotton fibers are shorter and lower in quality. Another commonly used material in mechanical processing is polyester. With this process, the recycled materials are not polyester textiles, but plastic bottles. Both are made of the same material known as  (PET). Once the materials are sent to the facility, first they are sorted by color and type. Similar to cotton, the PET plastic is shredded into slices and washed to remove contaminants. The dried, shredded plastic is molded into PET pellets and undergoes  to create new fibers.\nChemical processing is typically used on synthetic fibers such as  (PET) as these fibers can undergo a breaking down and recreation process. This process is not yet widely used, but there are companies that are researching and implementing chemical recycling. The major small scale production sites are from Eco Circle, Worn Again, Evrnu, and Ioncell. In the case of PET, the starting materials are first broken down to monomers. This is done by using chemicals that facilitate , , , and/or . This act of  also removes contaminants from the starting material such as dyes and unwanted fibers. From here, the material is polymerized to be used to produce textile products. Unlike the mechanical method of recycling, chemical recycling produces high quality fibers similar to the virgin fiber used. Therefore, no new fibers are needed to support the product of the chemical process. Different chemicals and pathways are used for other materials such as nylon and cellulose based fibers, but the overall structure of the process is the same.\nMany clothing retailers across the world have implemented recycled textiles in their products. Companies like These retailers cater to environmentally conscious consumers by producing .\nCompanies such as Patagonia, Everlane, H&M, Lindex, Pure Waste, and Heavy Eco sell sustainable clothes. These companies incorporate materials derived from textile post-consumer waste as well as recycled plastics into the clothes they sell.\nWithin Scandinavia specifically there are prolific applications of recycled textiles that have created mainstream market products. In Sweden, companies such as H&M and Lindex are including pre and post-consumer waste fibers within their new clothing lines. Similarly in Finland, Pure Waste is a clothing enterprise that creates t-shirts from recycled fibers in their 95% wind powered factories.\nAside from clothing, Eget\u00e6pper is a Danish carpet manufacturing company that makes their carpets using the fibers from recycled fishnets.\n"},

Currently just over half of  are recycled globally About 1 million plastic bottles are bought around the world every minute and only about 50% are recycled.\nThere are a large number of benefits to recycling glass bottles, not only for the manfucaturing of new bottles but also for the production of other materials that can be used in different contexts. Clean  are 100% recyclable, can be substituted for up to 95% of raw material, and can be recycled ad-infinitum without the loss of purity or quality. Recycled glass also has a variety of uses outside of the production of new bottles. The least beneficial of these uses is when glass bottles are sifted, crushed down, and mixed with food refuse to create dirty .  has few uses outside of being used as and alternative to traditional landfill . Alternatively, smaller and unrecoverable pieces of glass are ground down into a fine powder and used as a high grade sand alternative for the production of concrete.  \nRecoverable glass is often sorted by colour as different colour glass has a variety of uses and values. In the United States, recovered green glass is primarily shipped to Europe to produce wine bottles, brown glass is sold domestically to beer bottlers, and clear glass, the most valuable of the three can be used to replace up to 30 percent of virgin material in the production of new glass.  In recent years,  (or EPR) has come to the forefront of the debate concerning glass bottle recycling due to glass being very easy to clean and reuse, and its innate  properties. Infact, recycled glass is a necessity, as without it, manufacturers would not be able to keep up with the demand for new glass containers.  \nRecycling one glass bottle can save enough energy to power a  for 25 minutes.Infact for every 10% of cullet added to the production of a new bottle, energy usage goes down by 3-4%. Recycling one ton of glass can save approximately 42 kwh of energy which translates to 7.5 pounds of air pollutants not being released into the atmosphere  \nWhile the benefits of recycling glass are numerous, many argue that glass recycling carries many negative aspects as well. Glass recycling facilities require fewer labourers so it is argued that by increasing the production of glass bottles from recycled sources, jobs are being taken away from people working in the manufacturing of new glass bottles which is a more labor intensive process. While recycling bottles does reduce energy consumption for the process itself, it does however have the potential to increase over emissions due to the increased need for transportation of materials. This argument however does not take into account the energy intensity of the production of virgin glass in the first place.  Due to glass also being non reactive, meaning it will not breakdown into more dangerous substances, it would have minimal impact on the environment other than being a mild eye sore.\nPET bottles are mostly recycled as a raw material. In many countries, PET plastics are coded with the resin identification code number \"1\" inside the universal recycling symbol, usually located on the bottom of the container.\nHDPE is commonly used in bottles, particularly bottles (or jugs) of milk.  Recycling code 2 is applicable.  In the US, only about 30-35% of HDPE bottles are recycled.\n are laws passed by city, state, provincial, or national governments.

The main types of appliances that are recycled are , , , , and . When appliances are recycled, they can be looked upon as valuable resources. If disposed of improperly, appliances can become environmentally harmful and .\nThe strength of appliance recycling legislation and the percentage of appliances recycled varies around the world.\nA key part of appliance recycling is the manual dismantling of each product. The disassembly removes hazardous components, while sorting out reusable parts. Procedures vary and depends on the appliance type. The amount of hazardous components able to be removed also depends on the type of appliance. Low removal rates of hazardous components reduce the recyclability of valuable materials. Each type of appliance has its own set of characteristics and components. This makes characterization of appliances essential to sorting and separating parts. Research on appliance dismantling has become an active area, intending to help recycling reach maximum efficiency.\nThere is a certain process used to recover materials from appliances. Parts are generally removed in order from largest to smallest. Metals are extracted first and then . Materials are sorted by either size, shape, or . Sizing is a good means of sorting to quicken future processing. It also classifies fractions that show composition. Materials report to larger or finer fractions based on original dimension, toughness, or brittleness. Shape classification contributes to the dynamics of the material. Classification by density is important when it comes to determining the use of a material.\n and  are sorted out first for quality control purposes. The materials are then compacted. Next, iron and steel () are extracted using . They are collected and made ready for sale. Then metals are separated from non-metals using eddy currents.  are created by rapidly alternating magnetic fields, which induce metals to jump away from non-metals. Then water separation is used to sort plastics and glass from circuit boards and copper wires. Circuit boards and copper content is then sold. Plastics and glass are further compacted for reuse.\nAlthough appliance recycling is still quite new, countries have been making the effort to enact laws and regulations regarding the electric waste. Early addressing of waste home appliance recycling started with Japan, Switzerland, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Germany.\nIn 2003  (WEEE) passed into . It sets collection, recycling and recovery targets for all types of electrical goods.\nBy the 1950s and 60s Japan had already become a major producer of electric appliances. The first initiatives to recycle were launched in the 70s. Due to costs, disassembly was hardly achievable. The Home Appliance Recycling Law was enacted in 1998 and came into force in 2001, and recycling of waste electrics became a legal requirement under the Specific Household Appliance Recycling Law and the Law for Promotion of Effective Utilisation Resources.  Appliance manufacturers are now required to finance the recycling of their products. The Association for Electric Home Appliances is a trade group that is responsible for orphaned products.\nChina produces a significant share of the world's appliances. This country also has a high influx of appliance waste. There has not been much progress in appliance recycling efficiency. China's undeveloped dismantling and processing has led to elevated levels of  in waste appliance site vicinities. Their appliance recycling methods require severe improvement.\nThe United States is the largest waste appliance producer in the world, however there is still no federal law requiring appliance recycling and its legislation varies between states. On a state level, many mandatory electronic recovery programs have been implemented. There are also several commercial appliance recyclers, for example,  (ARCA).  ARCA is a company based in Minneapolis, with a chain of recycling depots nationwide.\nIn 2003, the  was signed. It established a new program for consumers to return, recycle, and ensure the safe and environmentally sound disposal of video display devices, such as televisions and computer monitors, that are hazardous wastes when discarded.  In 2005, consumers began paying a 6-10 dollar fee when buying an electronic device. These fees are used to pay e-waste collectors and recyclers to cover their cost of managing . \nThe EWRA classifies e-waste by dividing the products into two categories: electronic devices and covered electronic devices. Only covered electronic devices (CEDs) are included in the EWRA, however all electronic devices needed recycling measures to be taken.

Essentially, manufacturers must now finance product treatment and recycling. Countries where this strategy has been adopted for waste appliances are: Switzerland (1998), Denmark (1999), Netherlands (1999), Norway (1999), Belgium (2001), Japan (2001), Sweden (2001) and Germany (2005), but it has also been expanded through legislation among certain South American countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Peru. Countries in which EPR has long been established, demonstrate that the combination of government legislation and sound company practices can produce a higher take-back and recycling rate. An example of this is the Sony Corporation in Japan, achieving a 53% recycling rate. Other ways countries approach the issue of waste appliances is either by offering recycling facilities or banning importation. Almost all countries, at least offer facilities that aid in appliance recycling. Many implement extended producer responsibility, in addition to recycling facilities.\n"},

Oil recycling also benefits the environment: increased opportunities for consumers to recycle oil lessens the likelihood of used oil being dumped on lands and in waterways. For example, one  of motor oil dumped into waterways has the potential to pollute one million gallons of water.\nRecycled motor oil can be combusted as fuel, usually in plant boilers, space heaters, or industrial heating applications such as blast furnaces and cement kilns. When used motor oil is burned as fuel it must be burned at high temperatures to avoid gaseous pollution. Alternatively, waste motor oil can be  into  or  in a process similar to oil re-refining, but without the final  process. The lubrication properties of motor oil persist, even in used oil, and it can be recycled indefinitely.\nUsed oil re-refining is the process of restoring used oil to new oil by removing chemical impurities, heavy metals and dirt. Used industrial and automotive oil is recycled at re-refineries. The used oil is first tested to determine suitability for re-refining, after which it is dehydrated and the water distillate is treated before being released into the environment. Dehydrating also removes the residual light fuel that can be used to power the refinery, and additionally captures  for re-use in recycled antifreeze.\nNext, industrial fuel is separated out of the used oil then  removes the lube cut (that is, the fraction suitable for reuse as lubricating oil) leaving a heavy oil that contains the used oil's additives and other by-products such as asphalt extender. The lube cut next undergoes hydro treating, or  to remove residual polymers and other chemical compounds, and saturate carbon chains with hydrogen for greater stability.\nFinal oil separation, or fractionating, separates the oil into three different oil grades: Light viscosity lubricants suitable for general lubricant applications, low viscosity lubricants for automotive and industrial applications, and high viscosity lubricants for heavy-duty applications. The oil that is produced in this step is referred to as re-refined base oil (RRBL).\nThe final step is blending additives into these three grades of oil products to produce final products with the right detergent and anti-friction qualities. Then each product is tested again for quality and purity before being released for sale to the public.\nBut you can not simply compare those ratios and conclude that refining from crude is immensely inefficient.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timber_recycling", "title": "TimberrecyclingWikipedia", "body": "\n or  is the process of turning waste  into usable products. Recycling timber is a practice that was popularized in the early 1990s as issues such as deforestation and climate change prompted both timber suppliers and consumers to turn to a more sustainable timber source. Recycling timber is the  form of timber production and is very common in countries such as Australia and New Zealand where supplies of old wooden structures are plentiful. Timber can be chipped down into wood chips which can be used to power homes or power plants.\nRecycling timber has become popular due to its image as an environmentally friendly product. Common belief among consumers is that by purchasing recycled wood, the demand for \"green timber\" will fall and ultimately benefit the environment. Greenpeace also view recycled timber as an environmentally friendly product, citing it as the most preferable timber source on their website. The arrival of recycled timber as a construction product has been important in both raising industry and consumer awareness towards deforestation and promoting timber mills to adopt more environmentally friendly practices.\nRecycling one ton of wood can save 18,000,000 btus of energy\nSome hurdles facing the widespread adoption of recycled timber: sometimes the ends of wall studs need to be trimmed off to stop decay and cracking, thus resulting in a shorter piece of wood; this trimming may result in pieces of wood that do not meet building codes. Though the price may be less than for new wood, the process of selecting usable pieces of salvaged wood, pulling out nails, and refinishing for a new use can be laborious and time-consuming.  Demolition must happen in such a way as to preserve as much of the timber as possible in a building, which means more time spent dismantling a building rather than just tearing it down quickly. The trade in recycled timber is not well-established everywhere, so a reliable supply of usable wood may be hard to come by for builders. There may be a stigma associated with using \"used\" or \"cheap\" wood that is perceived to be of not as high quality as \"new\" wood. Not all pieces of wood in a dismantled building will fit in a new building, and it may be cheaper and easier, from a design and labor perspective, to simply get new wood (ex: wood from a 6-foot (1.8 m) deck being used in a 7-foot (2.1 m) deck). Of course, none of these issues are insurmountable, and they are issues of convenience and logistics rather than structural integrity, but many builders find it easier and less time-consuming to simply get new wood in standard uniform sizes.\nRecycled timber most commonly comes from old buildings, bridges and wharfs, where it is carefully stripped out and put aside by demolishers. At the same time any usable  is set aside for reuse. The demolishers then sell the salvaged timber to merchants who then re-mill the timber by manually scanning it with a metal detector, which allows the timber to be de-nailed and sawn to size. Once re-milled the timber is commonly sold to consumers in the form of timber flooring, beams and decking.\nUse of recycling timber is not new. As early as 1948, the 100 metre tall tower of  near Potsdam, Germany was built from recycled timber. It stood for 31 years.\nIt was common to reuse wood of dismantled radio towers in the 1930s in Germany, e.g. the former tower of  was built of wood from a dismantled tower, which carried a T-antenna at . The upper parts of the 157-metre-tall wood tower of , which stood for 49 years, were built of wood from a smaller radio tower dismantled in 1934.\n"},

Such boards are also referred to as sheetrock, plasterboards, drywall, wallboards and gyprock. Gypsum waste in some countries also consists of gypsum blocks and plaster, among others.\nThree main types of gypsum waste based on their origin can be distinguished:\nThe recycled gypsum obtained from this is known as post-consumer recycled gypsum.\nGypsum waste can be turned into recycled gypsum by processing the gypsum waste in such a way that the contaminants are removed and the paper facing of the plasterboard is separated from the gypsum core through mechanical processes including grinding and sieving in specialised equipment. Gypsum waste such as gypsum blocks and plaster do not require the removal of paper, as they are not made with paper from the beginning.\nIt is typical for the gypsum recyclers to accept up to 3 per cent of contamination from other materials. The professional recyclers are capable of handling gypsum waste with nails and screws, wall coverings etc.\nGypsum materials consist of  (CaSO4\u00b72H2O).   convert sulfates to toxic  gas; they are killed by exposure to air, but the moist, airless, carbon-containing environment in a landfill is a good habitat for them.  So gypsum put into landfill will decompose, releasing up to a quarter its weight in .  Moreover,  also thrive in such an environment, and convert the paper in the plasterboard to  which is a potent .\nRecycling gypsum waste also reduces the need for the quarrying and production of virgin gypsum raw materials.\nRecycling one ton of the ordinary gypsum will save 1,000 pounds of black alkali, 1 ton of lactic acid and 500 kwh of energy.\nRecycling one metric ton of gypsum will save 28 kwh of energy and 4 pounds of aluminium.\nGypsum is fully and eternally recyclable  and, as a consequence, gypsum waste is one of the few construction materials for which closed loop recycling is possible.\nClosed loop recycling of gypsum products involves the collection and processing of the gypsum waste, and the delivery of the obtained recycled gypsum to the manufacturer of gypsum products. It is therefore essential that the recycled gypsum achieves a pre-determined quality suitable for the manufacturing of new gypsum products. Presently there is no European or American standard pre-determining the recycled gypsum's quality and the criteria vary from plant to plant.\nBy choosing closed loop recycling the need for manufacturers to acquire virgin gypsum is reduced, contributing therefore to promote a sustainable manufacturing process.\nThe most advanced plants, and most of these are found in the Nordic countries in Europe, have substituted up to 30 per cent of virgin gypsum raw materials with recycled gypsum.\nGypsum recycling in Europe was started by the Danish company  in Denmark, in 2001. After a few years the recycling system received waste from approximately 85 per cent of all public civic amenity/recycling centres and a recycling rate of 60 per cent of all gypsum waste was achieved. The system has been exported to cover other European countries.\nToday also new recyclers have emerged and gypsum recycling systems have been introduced in more countries, like the UK, France and in the Benelux, but the highest recycling rates for gypsum waste are still found in Denmark, Norway and Sweden. \nJanuary 1, 2013 the European Life + project \u201cGypsum to Gypsum\u201d  started, with the overall aim of transforming the gypsum demolition waste market to achieve higher recycling rates of gypsum waste, thereby helping to achieve a resource efficient economy. One of the drivers for the project is the target set by the European Union to achieve that 70 per cent of construction and demolition waste is recycled by 2020.\n Urban Gypsum is a division of Laneco, Inc. and provides gypsum wallboard recycling services for the Pacific Northwest of the United States.  This recovered gypsum is then distributed to agricultural and industrial customers in the region keeping the wallboard from ending up in the landfill.\n began recycling of wallboard waste in Canada in 1985. The recycled material is a blend of pre- and post-consumer, wet and dry gypsum waste that is a source of raw material for use in the manufacture of new drywall products.

Pennsylvania does not allow Gypsum Agri-cycle to recycle demolition drywall.\n began recycling gypsum in the form of sheetrock in 1999. In the recycling process, materials such as wood, metals, and trash are removed on-site where a dozer is used to crush the materials. \n\nAmerican Gypsum Recycling was founded in 2018 by Chris Stapleton. His vision for the company is to transform the Northwest drywall waste stream into a valuable product for agriculture and industry.\nUSA Gypsum located in Denver, PA provides both closed loop recycling and up-cycling reclaimed gypsum to higher value gypsum products such as agricultural gypsum.\n\n"},

It has a number of important benefits: It saves waste paper from occupying homes of people and producing methane as it breaks down. Because paper fibre contains carbon (originally absorbed by the tree from which it was produced), recycling keeps the carbon locked up for longer and out of the atmosphere. Around two thirds of all paper products in the US are now recovered and recycled, although it does not all become new paper. After repeated processing the fibres become too short for the production of new paper - this is why virgin fibre (from sustainably farmed trees) will be added to the pulp recipe.\nThere are three categories of paper that can be used as feedstocks for making : mill broke, pre-consumer waste, and .  is paper trimmings and other paper scrap from the manufacture of paper, and is recycled in a .  is a material which left the paper mill but was discarded before it was ready for consumer use.  waste is material discarded after consumer use, such as old corrugated containers (OCC), old magazines, and newspapers. Paper suitable for recycling is called \"scrap paper\", often used to produce  packaging. The industrial process of removing  from paper fibres of recycled paper to make  is called , an invention of the German jurist .\nThe process of waste paper recycling most often involves mixing used/old paper with water and chemicals to break it down. It is then chopped up and heated, which breaks it down further into strands of cellulose, a type of organic plant material; this resulting mixture is called pulp, or slurry. It is strained through , which remove any glue or  (especially from \n) that may still be in the mixture then cleaned, de-inked (ink is removed), bleached, and mixed with water. Then it can be made into new recycled paper.\nThe share of ink in a wastepaper stock is up to about 2% of the total weight.\nIndustrialized paper making has an effect on the environment both upstream (where raw materials are acquired and processed) and downstream (waste-disposal impacts).\nToday, 40% of paper pulp is created from wood (in most modern mills only 9-16% of pulp is made from pulp logs; the rest comes from waste wood that was traditionally burnt). Paper production accounts for about 35% of felled trees, and represents 1.2% of the world's total economic output. Recycling one ton of  saves about 1 ton of wood while recycling 1 ton of printing or copier paper saves slightly more than 2 tons of wood. This is because  requires twice as much wood since it removes  to produce higher quality fibres than mechanical pulping processes. Relating tons of paper recycled to the number of trees not cut is meaningless, since tree size varies tremendously and is the major factor in how much paper can be made from how many trees. In addition, trees raised specifically for pulp production account for 16% of world pulp production, old growth forests 9% and second- and third- and more generation forests account for the balance. Most pulp mill operators practice  to ensure a continuing supply of trees. The  (PEFC) and the  certify paper made from trees harvested according to guidelines meant to ensure good forestry practices.\nEnergy consumption is reduced by recycling, although there is debate concerning the actual energy savings realized. The  claims a 40% reduction in energy when paper is recycled versus paper made with unrecycled pulp, while the  (BIR) claims a 64% reduction. Some calculations show that recycling one ton of newspaper saves about 4,000\u00a0 (14\u00a0) of electricity, although this may be too high (see comments below on unrecycled pulp). This is enough electricity to power a 3-bedroom European house for an entire year, or enough energy to heat and air-condition the average North American home for almost six months. Recycling paper to make pulp actually consumes more fossil fuels than making new pulp via the ; these mills generate most  of their energy from burning waste wood (bark, roots, sawmill waste) and byproduct lignin (black liquor). Pulp mills producing new mechanical pulp use large amounts of energy; a very rough estimate of the electrical energy needed is 10 gigajoules per  of pulp (2500\u00a0kW\u00b7h per ).\nAbout 35% of municipal solid waste (before recycling) in the United States by weight is paper and paper products. 42.4% of that is recycled.\nThe  (EPA) has found that recycling causes 35% less water pollution and 74% less air pollution than making virgin paper.  can be sources of both air and water pollution, especially if they are producing  pulp. Modern mills produce considerably less pollution than those of a few decades ago. Recycling paper provides an alternative fibre for papermaking. Recycled pulp can be bleached with the same chemicals used to bleach virgin pulp, but  and  are the most common bleaching agents. Recycled pulp, or paper made from it, is known as PCF (process chlorine free) if no chlorine-containing compounds were used in the recycling process. However, recycling mills may have polluting by-products like sludge. De-inking at Cross Pointe's  mill results in sludge weighing 22% of the weight of wastepaper recycled.\nIn the mid-19th century, there was an increased demand for books and writing material. Up to that time, paper manufacturers had used discarded linen rags for paper, but supply could not keep up with the increased demand. Books were bought at auctions for the purpose of recycling fiber content into new paper, at least in the United Kingdom, by the beginning of the 19th century.\nInternationally, about half of all recovered paper comes from converting losses (pre-consumer recycling), such as shavings and unsold periodicals; approximately one third comes from household or post-consumer waste.\nSome statistics on paper consumption:\nPaper recycling in Europe has a long history. The industry self-initiative (ERPC) was set up in 2000 to monitor progress towards meeting the paper recycling targets set out in the 2000 European Declaration on Paper Recycling. Since then, the commitments in the Declaration have been renewed every five years. In 2011, the ERPC committed itself to meeting and maintaining both a voluntary recycling rate target of 70% in the then E-27 plus Switzerland and Norway by 2015 as well as qualitative targets in areas such as waste prevention, ecodesign and research and development. In 2014 the paper recycling rate in Europe was 71.7%, as stated in the .\nMunicipal collections of paper for recycling are in place. However, according to the , in 2008, eight paper manufacturers in Japan have admitted to intentionally mislabeling recycled paper products, exaggerating the amount of recycled paper used.\nRecycling has long been practiced in the . In 2012, paper and paperboard accounted for 68 million tons of municipal solid waste generated in the U.S., down from more than 87 million tons in 2000, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. While paper is the most commonly recycled material\u201464.6 percent was recovered in 2012\u2014it is being used less overall than at the turn of the century. Paper accounts for more than a half of all recyclables collected in the US, by weight.\nThe history of paper recycling has several dates of importance:\nToday, over half of all paper used in the United States is collected and recycled. Paper products are still the largest component of , making up more than 40% of the composition of . In 2006, a record 53.4% of the paper used in the US (53.5 million tons) was recovered for recycling, up from a 1990 recovery rate of 33.5%.\nThe US paper industry set a goal of recovering 55 percent of all paper used in the US by 2012. Paper products used by the packaging industry were responsible for about 77% of packaging materials recycled, with more than 24 million pounds recovered in 2005.\nBy 1998, some 9,000 curbside recycling programs and 12,000 recyclable drop-off centers existed nationwide. As of 1999, 480  had been established to process the collected materials. Recently, junk mail has become a larger part of the overall recycling stream, compared to newspapers or personal letters. However, the increase in junk mail is still smaller compared to the declining use of paper from those sources.\nIn 2008, the global financial crisis caused the price of old newspapers to drop in the U.S. from $130 to $40 per short ton ($140/t to $45/t) in October.\nThe environmental impact due to excessive use of paper has negative effects on trees and forest.  Paper production utilizes nearly 40% of world's commercially cut timber. Millions of acres of forests are destroyed leading to deforestation disturbing the ecological balance. Many initiatives are being taken in India for recycling paper and reducing the hazards associated with it. Shree Aniruddha Upasana Foundation (Mumbai, India) is one such organization which undertakes used paper recycling projects. The foundation encourages using paper bags instead of plastic ones which again are a serious hazard to environment. They accept old newspapers, notebooks and so on and recycle the same into paper bags, teaching aids and toys for children.\nThe foundation also makes eco-friendly Lord Ganesh (a Hindu Deity) idols from paper pulp which are worshiped in Indian homes every year during Ganesh Chaturthi Festival (a Hindu Festival celebrated on birthday of Lord Ganesh). These paper recycling activities are carried out throughout the year by the volunteers of the foundation converting waste paper into \u201cNo Waste\u201d \n\nIn Mexico, recycled paper, rather than wood pulp, is the principal feedstock in papermills accounting for about 75% of raw materials.\nIn 2018, South Africa recovered 1.285 million tonnes of recyclable paper products, putting the country's paper recovery rate at 71.7%. More than 90% of this recovered paper is used for the local beneficiation of new paper packaging and tissue. \n\nAlong with fibres, paper can contain a variety of  and organic constituents, including up to 10,000 different chemicals, which can potentially contaminate the newly manufactured paper products. As an example,  (a chemical commonly found in ) has been verified as a contaminant in a variety of paper products resulting from paper recycling. Furthermore, groups of chemicals as , , ,  and toxic metals have all been identified in paper material. Although several measures might reduce the chemical load in paper recycling (e.g., improved decontamination, optimized collection of paper for recycling), even completely terminating the use of a particular chemical (phase-out) might still result in its circulation in the paper cycle for decades.\n\u00a0This article incorporates\u00a0 from the  document: \"\".\n\n"},

Glass that is crushed and ready to be remelted is called . There are two types of cullet: internal and external.  is composed of defective products detected and rejected by a quality control process during the industrial process of , transition phases of product changes (such as thickness and colour changes) and production offcuts.  is waste glass that has been collected or reprocessed with the purpose of recycling. External cullet (which can be pre- or post-consumer) is classified as waste. The word \"cullet\", when used in the context of end-of-waste, will always refer to external cullet.\nTo be recycled, glass waste needs to be purified and cleaned of contamination. Then, depending on the end use and local processing capabilities, it might also have to be separated into different colors. Many recyclers collect different colors of glass separately since glass retains its color after . The most common colours used for consumer containers are clear (flint) glass, green glass, and brown (amber) glass. Glass is ideal for recycling since none of the material is degraded by normal use.\nMany collection points have separate bins for clear (flint), green and brown (amber). Glass re-processors intending to make new glass containers require separation by color, because glass tends to retain its color after recycling. If the recycled glass is not going to be made into more glass, or if the glass re-processor uses newer  equipment, separation by color at the collection point may not be required. Heat-resistant glass, such as  or , must not be part of the glass recycling stream, because even a small piece of such material will alter the viscosity of the fluid in the  at remelt.\n\nTo be able to use external cullet in production, any contaminants should be removed as much as possible. Typical contaminations are:\nManpower or machinery can be used in different stages of purification. Since they melt at higher temperatures than glass, separation of inorganics, the removal of heat resistant glass and lead glass is critical. In the modern recycling facilities, dryer systems and  are used. The input material should be sized and cleaned for the highest efficiency in automatic sorting. More than one free fall or conveyor belt sorter can be used, depending on the requirements of the process. Different colors can be sorted by optical sorting machines.\nGlass bottles and jars are infinitely recyclable. The use of recycled glass in manufacturing conserves raw materials and reduces energy consumption. Because the chemical energy required to melt the raw materials has already been expended, the use of cullet can significantly reduce energy consumption compared with manufacturing new glass from silica (SiO2), soda ash (Na2CO3), and lime (CaCO3). Soda lime glass from virgin raw materials theoretically requires approximately 2.671 GJ/tonne compared to 1.886 GJ/tonne to melt 100% glass cullet. As a general rule, every 10% increase in cullet usage results in an energy savings of 2\u20133% in the melting process, with a theoretical maximum potential of 30% energy saving. Every  (1,000\u00a0kg) of waste glass recycled into new items saves 315 kilograms (694\u00a0lb) of  from being released into the atmosphere during the manufacture of new glass.\nThe use of the recycled glass as aggregate in  has become popular, with large-scale research on that application being carried out at Columbia University in New York. Recycled glass greatly enhances the aesthetic appeal of the concrete. Recent research has shown that concrete made with recycled glass aggregates have better long-term strength and better thermal insulation, due to the thermal properties of the glass aggregates. Glass which is not recycled, but crushed, reduces the volume of waste sent to . Waste glass may also be kept out of landfill by using it for roadbed aggregate or landfill cover.\nGlass , a mix of colors crushed to a small size, is substituted for pea gravel or crushed rock in many construction and utility projects, saving municipalities, such as the City of  , thousands of dollars (depending on the size of the project). Glass aggregate is not sharp to handle. In many cases, the state Department of Transportation has specifications for use, size and percentage of quantity for use.  Common applications are as pipe bedding\u2014placed around sewer, storm water or drinking water pipes, to transfer weight from the surface and protect the pipe.  Another common use is as fill to bring the level of a concrete floor even with a foundation.\nOther uses for recycled glass include:\nMixed waste streams may be collected from  or  systems. Some facilities can sort mixed waste streams into different colours using  units.\nIn 2019, many Australian cities after decades of poor planning and minimum investment are winding back their glass recycling programmes in favour of plastic usage.\nFor many years, there was only one state in Australia with a return deposit scheme on glass containers. Other states had unsuccessfully tried to lobby for glass deposit schemes. More recently this situation has changed dramatically, with the original scheme in South Australia now joined by  in New South Wales, Queensland, Australian Capital Territory, and the Northern Territory, with schemes planned in Western Australia (2020), Tasmania (2022) and Victoria (2023).\nIn 2004, Germany recycled 2.116 million tons of glass. Reusable glass or plastic (PET) bottles are available for many drinks, especially beer and carbonated water as well as soft drinks (). The  () is \u20ac0.08-\u20ac0.15, compared to \u20ac0.25 for recyclable but not reusable plastic bottles. There is no deposit for glass bottles which do not get refilled.\nGlass collection points, known as  are very common near , at  and in local neighborhoods in the . The first bottle bank was introduced by Stanley Race , then president of the  and Ron England in  on 6 June 1977. Development work was done by the DoE at Warren Springs laboratory, Stevenage, (now AERA at Harwell) and Nazeing Glass Works,  to prove if a usable glass product could be made from over 90% recycled glass. It was found necessary to use magnets to remove unwanted metal closures in the mixture.\nBottle banks commonly stand beside collection points for other recyclable waste like ,  and . Local, municipal  usually have one central point for all types of waste in which large glass containers are located. There are now over 50,000 bottle banks in the United Kingdom, and 752,000 tons of glass are now recycled annually.\nThe waste recycling industry in the UK cannot consume all of the recycled container glass that will become available over the coming years, mainly due to the colour imbalance between that which is manufactured and that which is consumed. The UK imports much more green glass in the form of  bottles than it uses, leading to a surplus amount for recycling.\nThe resulting surplus of green glass from imported bottles may be exported to producing countries, or used locally in the growing diversity of secondary end uses for recycled glass. As of 2006,  were shipping glass cullet from the UK to .\nRates of recycling and methods of waste collection vary substantially across the United States because laws are written on the state or local level and large municipalities often have their own unique systems. Many cities do , meaning they collect household recyclable waste on a weekly or bi-weekly basis that residents set out in special containers in front of their homes and transported to a . This is typically , which creates an impure product and partly explains why, as of 2019, the US has a recycling rate of around 33% versus 90% in some European countries.\nApartment dwellers usually use shared containers that may be collected by the city or by private recycling companies which can have their own recycling rules.  In some cases, glass is specifically separated into its own container because broken glass is a hazard to the people who later manually sort the co-mingled recyclables.  Sorted recyclables are later sold to companies to be used in the manufacture of new products.\nIn 1971, the  requiring buyers of carbonated beverages (such as beer and soda) to pay five cents per container (increased to ten cents in April 2017) as a deposit which would be refunded to anyone who returned the container for recycling. This law has since been copied in  including New York and California. The abbreviations of states with deposit laws are printed on all qualifying bottles and cans. In states with these container deposit laws, most supermarkets automate the deposit refund process by providing  which will count containers as they are inserted and then print credit vouchers that can be redeemed at the store for the number of containers returned. Small glass bottles (mostly beer) are broken, one-by-one, inside these deposit refund machines as the bottles are inserted. A large, wheeled hopper (very roughly 1.5\u00a0m by 1.5\u00a0m by 0.5\u00a0m) inside the machine collects the broken glass until it can be emptied by an employee. Nationwide bottle refunds recover 80% of glass containers that require a deposit.\nMajor companies in the space include Strategic Materials, which purchases post-consumer glass for 47 facilities across the country. Strategic Materials has worked to correct misconceptions about glass recycling. Glass manufacturers such as  ultimately include recycled glass in their product. The Glass Recycling Coalition is a group of companies and stakeholders working to improve glass recycling.\n"},

Crushing facilities accept only  concrete, which must be free of , ,  and other such materials.  such as  are accepted, since they can be removed with  and other sorting devices and  down for recycling elsewhere. The remaining aggregate chunks are sorted by size. Larger chunks may go through the crusher again.  After crushing has taken place, other particulates are filtered out through a variety of methods including hand-picking and water flotation.\nCrushing at the actual construction site using portable crushers reduces construction costs and the pollution generated when compared with transporting material to and from a . Large road-portable plants can crush concrete and asphalt rubble at 600 tons per hour or more. These systems normally consist of a rubble crusher, side discharge conveyor, screening plant, and a return conveyor from the screen to the crusher inlet for reprocessing oversize materials. Compact, self-contained mini-crushers are also available that can handle up to 150 tons per hour and fit into tighter areas. With the advent of crusher attachments - those connected to various construction equipment, such as excavators - the trend towards recycling on-site with smaller volumes of material is growing rapidly. These attachments encompass volumes of 100 tons/hour and less.\nSmaller pieces of concrete are used as gravel for new construction projects.  gravel is laid down as the lowest layer in a road, with fresh concrete or asphalt poured over it.  The US  may use techniques such as these to build new highways from the materials of old highways. Crushed recycled concrete can also be used as the dry aggregate for brand new concrete if it is free of contaminants. Also, concrete pavements can be broken in place and used as a base layer for an  pavement through a process called .\nLarger pieces of crushed concrete can be used as  revetments, which are \"a very effective and popular method of controlling streambank erosion.\"\nWith proper quality control at the crushing facility, well graded and aesthetically pleasing materials can be provided as a substitute for landscaping stone or mulch.\nWire  (cages), can be filled with crushed concrete and stacked together to provide economical retaining walls. Stacked gabions are also used to build privacy screen walls (in lieu of fencing).\nRecent statistics show that the increasing demand of construction aggregate could reach 48.3 billion metric tons by the year 2015 with the highest consumption being in Asia and Pacific. The high demand of concrete means more new building will be constructed after the demolition of old buildings, generating a large volume of C&D waste (construction waste & demolition waste) as a by product of economic growth. However, the most common way to dispose this waste is by dumping it in a landfill. Without proper maintenance, landfills can cause many environmental problems such as air pollution and water contamination. This, along with the shortage of resources caused by this growth in construction, has caused more and more countries to begin considering the importance of C&D waste recycling.\nIn general, the reuse and recycle of construction waste is concentrated in the preparation of recycled aggregate for concrete. By adding a portion of recycled aggregate instead of natural aggregate coarse into the mixture, producing the recycled concrete, which can conserve energy and materials for concrete production.\nSome experiments showed that recycled aggregate doesn't have good durability like the natural coarse aggregate but the durability can be improved by mixing it with special materials such as fly ash to produce high strength and durable concrete.\nThere are a variety of benefits in recycling concrete rather than dumping it or burying it in a landfill.\nThere have been concerns about the recycling of painted concrete due to possible lead content. The ' Construction Engineering Research Laboratory (CERL) and others have conducted studies to see if lead-based paint in crushed concrete actually poses a hazard. It was concluded that concrete with  would be able to be used as clean fill without impervious cover but with some type of soil cover.\n"},

Asphalt mixtures have been used in pavement construction since the  beginning of the twentieth century. It consists of   together with , laid in layers, and compacted. The process was refined and enhanced by Belgian inventor and U.S. immigrant .\nThe terms  (or ) , , and  are typically used only in  and construction documents, which define concrete as any composite material composed of mineral aggregate adhered with a binder. The abbreviation, , is sometimes used for  but can also denote  or , referring to the liquid asphalt portion of the composite material.\nMixing of asphalt and aggregate is accomplished in one of several ways:\nIn addition to the asphalt and aggregate, additives, such as , and antistripping agents may be added to improve the properties of the final product.\nAreas paved with asphalt concrete\u2014especially \u2014have been called \"the tarmac\" at times, despite not being constructed using the  process.\nA variety of specialty asphalt concrete mixtures have been developed to meet specific needs, such as , which is designed to ensure a very strong wearing surface, or  pavements, which are permeable and allow water to drain through the pavement for controlling stormwater.\nDifferent types of asphalt concrete have different performance characteristics in terms of surface durability, tire wear, braking efficiency and . In principle, the determination of appropriate asphalt performance characteristics must take into account the volume of traffic in each vehicle category, and the performance requirements of the friction course.\nAsphalt concrete generates less roadway noise than a  surface, and is typically less noisy than  surfaces. Because tire noise is generated through the conversion of  to , more noise is produced as the speed of a vehicle increases. The notion that highway design might take into account acoustical engineering considerations, including the selection of the type of surface paving, arose in the early 1970s.\nWith regard to structural performance, the asphalt behaviour depends on a variety of factors including the material, loading and environmental condition. Furthermore, the performance of pavement varies over time. Therefore, the long-term behaviour of asphalt pavement is different from its short-term performance. The  is a research program by the ,  which is specifically focusing on long-term pavement behaviour.\nAsphalt deterioration can include , , upheaval, raveling, , , shoving, stripping, and grade depressions. In cold climates,  can crack asphalt even in one winter. Filling the cracks with bitumen is a temporary fix, but only proper compaction and drainage can slow this process.\nFactors that cause asphalt concrete to deteriorate over time mostly fall into one of three categories: construction quality, environmental considerations, and traffic loads. Often, damage results from combinations of factors in all three categories.\nConstruction quality is critical to pavement performance. This includes the construction of utility trenches and appurtenances that are placed in the pavement after construction. Lack of compaction in the surface of the asphalt, especially on the longitudinal joint can reduce the life of a pavement by 30 to 40%. Service trenches in pavements after construction have been said to reduce the life of the pavement by 50%, mainly due to the lack of compaction in the trench, and also because of water intrusion through improperly sealed joints.\nEnvironmental factors include heat and cold, the presence of water in the  or subgrade soil underlying the pavement, and frost heaves.\nHigh temperatures soften the asphalt binder, allowing heavy tire loads to deform the pavement into ruts. Paradoxically, high heat and strong sunlight also cause the asphalt to oxidize, becoming stiffer and less resilient, leading to crack formation. Cold temperatures can cause cracks as the asphalt contracts. Cold asphalt is also less resilient and more vulnerable to cracking.\nWater trapped under the pavement softens the subbase and subgrade, making the road more vulnerable to traffic loads. Water under the road freezes and expands in cold weather, causing and enlarging cracks. In spring thaw, the ground thaws from the top down, so water is trapped between the pavement above and the still-frozen soil underneath. This layer of saturated soil provides little support for the road above, leading to the formation of potholes. This is more of a problem for  or  soils than sandy or gravelly soils. Some jurisdictions pass  to reduce the allowable weight of trucks during the spring thaw season and protect their roads.\nThe damage a vehicle causes is roughly proportional to the axle load raised to the fourth power, so doubling the weight an axle carries actually causes 16 times as much damage. Wheels cause the road to flex slightly, resulting in  cracking, which often leads to crocodile cracking. Vehicle speed also plays a role. Slowly moving vehicles stress the road over a longer period of time, increasing ruts, cracking, and corrugations in the asphalt pavement.\nOther causes of damage include heat damage from vehicle fires, or solvent action from chemical spills.\nThe life of a road can be prolonged through good design, construction and maintenance practices. During design, engineers measure the traffic on a road, paying special attention to the number and types of trucks. They also evaluate the  to see how much load it can withstand. The pavement and subbase thicknesses are designed to withstand the wheel loads. Sometimes,  are used to reinforce the subbase and further strengthen the roads. Drainage, including ,  and underdrains are used to remove water from the roadbed, preventing it from weakening the subbase and subsoil.\nGood maintenance practices center on keeping water out of the pavement, subbase and subsoil. Maintaining and cleaning ditches and storm drains will extend the life of the road at low cost. Sealing small cracks with bituminous crack sealer prevents water from enlarging cracks through , or percolating down to the subbase and softening it.\nFor somewhat more distressed roads, a  or similar surface treatment may be applied. As the number, width and length of cracks increases, more intensive repairs are needed. In order of generally increasing expense, these include thin asphalt overlays, multicourse overlays, grinding off the top course and overlaying, in-place recycling, or full-depth reconstruction of the roadway.\nIt is far less expensive to keep a road in good condition than it is to repair it once it has deteriorated. This is why some agencies place the priority on preventive maintenance of roads in good condition, rather than reconstructing roads in poor condition. Poor roads are upgraded as resources and budget allow. In terms of lifetime cost and long term pavement conditions, this will result in better system performance. Agencies that concentrate on restoring their bad roads often find that by the time they have repaired them all, the roads that were in good condition have deteriorated.\nSome agencies use a  to help prioritize maintenance and repairs.\nAsphalt concrete is 100% recyclable and is the most widely reused construction material in the world. Very little asphalt concrete \u2014 less than 1 percent, according to a survey by the US  and the National Asphalt Pavement Association conducted annually since 2009 \u2014 is actually disposed of in . When asphalt pavement material is reclaimed for reuse, it is able to replace both virgin  and virgin asphalt binder. In 2018, new asphalt pavement mixtures produced in the United States contained, on average, more than 21% reclaimed asphalt pavement.\nThere is asphalt recycling on a large scale (known as in-place asphalt recycling or asphalt recycling performed at a hot mix plant) and asphalt recycling on a smaller scale.  For small scale asphalt recycling, the user separates asphalt material into three different categories:\nSmall scale asphalt recycling will usually involve high speed on-site asphalt recycling equipment or overnight soft heat asphalt recycling.\nSmall scale asphalt recycling is used when wanting to make smaller road repairs vs. large scale asphalt recycling which is done for making new asphalt or for tearing up old asphalt and simultaneously recycling or replacing existing asphalt.  Recycled asphalt is very effective for pothole and utility cut repairs.  The recycled asphalt will generally last as long or longer than the road around it as new asphalt cement has been added back to the material.\nFor larger scale asphalt recycling, several in-place recycling techniques have been developed to rejuvenate oxidized binders and remove cracking, although the recycled material is generally not very water-tight or smooth and should be overlaid with a new layer of asphalt concrete. Cold in-place recycling mills off the top layers of asphalt concrete and mixes the resulting loose millings with asphalt emulsion. The mixture is then placed back down on the roadway and compacted. The water in the emulsion is allowed to evaporate for a week or so, and new hot-mix asphalt is laid on top.\nAsphalt concrete that is removed from a pavement is usually stockpiled for later use as aggregate for new hot mix asphalt at an . This reclaimed material, or RAP, is crushed to a consistent gradation and added to the HMA mixing process.  Sometimes waste materials, such as asphalt roofing shingles, crushed glass, or  from old , are added to asphalt concrete as is the case with , but there is a concern that the hybrid material may not be .\n"},

A freshly exposed surface of pure copper has a . Copper is used as a conductor of heat and electricity, as a , and as a constituent of various metal , such as  used in ,  used to make marine hardware and , and  used in  and  for temperature measurement.\nCopper is one of the few metals that can occur in nature in a directly usable metallic form (). This led to very early human use in several regions, from c. 8000 BC. Thousands of years later, it was the first metal to be  from sulfide ores, c. 5000 BC; the first metal to be cast into a shape in a mold, c. 4000 BC; and the first metal to be purposefully alloyed with another metal, , to create , c. 3500 BC.\nIn the , copper was mined principally on , the origin of the name of the metal, from  (metal of Cyprus), later corrupted to  (Latin).  () and  were derived from this, the later spelling first used around 1530.\nCommonly encountered compounds are copper(II) salts, which often impart blue or green colors to such minerals as , , and , and have been used widely and historically as pigments.\nCopper used in buildings, usually for roofing, oxidizes to form a green  (or ). Copper is sometimes used in , both in its elemental metal form and in compounds as pigments. Copper compounds are used as , , and wood preservatives.\nCopper is essential to all living organisms as a trace  because it is a key constituent of the respiratory enzyme complex . In  and , copper is a constituent of the blood pigment , replaced by the iron-complexed  in fish and other . In humans, copper is found mainly in the liver, muscle, and bone. The adult body contains between 1.4 and 2.1\u00a0mg of copper per kilogram of body weight.\nCopper, , and  are in  of the periodic table; these three metals have one s-orbital electron on top of a filled d- and are characterized by high , and electrical and thermal conductivity. The filled d-shells in these elements contribute little to interatomic interactions, which are dominated by the s-electrons through . Unlike metals with incomplete d-shells, metallic bonds in copper are lacking a  character and are relatively weak. This observation explains the low  and high ductility of  of copper. At the macroscopic scale, introduction of extended defects to the , such as grain boundaries, hinders flow of the material under applied stress, thereby increasing its hardness. For this reason, copper is usually supplied in a fine-grained  form, which has greater strength than monocrystalline forms.\nThe softness of copper partly explains its high electrical conductivity (59.6\u00d710\u00a0/m) and high thermal conductivity, second highest (second only to silver) among pure metals at room temperature. This is because the resistivity to electron transport in metals at room temperature originates primarily from scattering of electrons on thermal vibrations of the lattice, which are relatively weak in a soft metal. The maximum permissible current density of copper in open air is approximately 3.1\u00d710\u00a0A/m of cross-sectional area, above which it begins to heat excessively.\nCopper is one of a few metallic elements with a natural color other than gray or silver. Pure copper is orange-red and acquires a reddish  when exposed to air. The characteristic color of copper results from the electronic transitions between the filled 3d and half-empty 4s atomic shells \u2013 the energy difference between these shells corresponds to orange light.\nAs with other metals, if copper is put in contact with another metal,  will occur.\nCopper does not react with water, but it does slowly react with atmospheric oxygen to form a layer of brown-black copper oxide which, unlike the  that forms on iron in moist air, protects the underlying metal from further corrosion ().

Isotopes with a  above 64 decay by , whereas those with a mass number below 64 decay by . , which has a half-life of 12.7 hours, decays both ways.\nCu and Cu have significant applications. Cu is used in Cu-PTSM as a  for .\nCopper is produced in massive stars and is present in the Earth's crust in a proportion of about 50 parts per million (ppm). In nature, copper occurs in a variety of minerals, including , copper sulfides such as , , , , and , copper  such as , and , copper carbonates such as  and , and as copper(I) or copper(II) oxides such as  and , respectively. The largest mass of elemental copper discovered weighed 420 tonnes and was found in 1857 on the  in Michigan, US. Native copper is a , with the largest single crystal ever described measuring 4.4\u00d73.2\u00d73.2\u00a0cm.\nMost copper is mined or  as copper sulfides from large  in  deposits that contain 0.4 to 1.0% copper. Sites include , in Chile, , in Utah, United States, and , in New Mexico, United States. According to the , in 2005, Chile was the top producer of copper with at least one-third of the world share followed by the United States, Indonesia and Peru. Copper can also be recovered through the  process. Several sites in the state of Arizona are considered prime candidates for this method. The amount of copper in use is increasing and the quantity available is barely sufficient to allow all countries to reach developed world levels of usage.\nCopper has been in use at least 10,000 years, but more than 95% of all copper ever mined and  has been extracted since 1900, and more than half was extracted the last 24 years. As with many natural resources, the total amount of copper on Earth is vast, with around 10 tons in the top kilometer of Earth's crust, which is about 5 million years' worth at the current rate of extraction. However, only a tiny fraction of these reserves is economically viable with present-day prices and technologies. Estimates of copper reserves available for mining vary from 25 to 60 years, depending on core assumptions such as the growth rate. Recycling is a major source of copper in the modern world. Because of these and other factors, the future of copper production and supply is the subject of much debate, including the concept of , analogous to .\nThe price of copper has historically been unstable, and its price increased from the 60-year low of US$0.60/lb (US$1.32/kg) in June 1999 to $3.75 per pound ($8.27/kg) in May 2006. It dropped to $2.40/lb ($5.29/kg) in February 2007, then rebounded to $3.50/lb ($7.71/kg) in April 2007. In February 2009, weakening global demand and a steep fall in commodity prices since the previous year's highs left copper prices at $1.51/lb ($3.32/kg).\nThe concentration of copper in ores averages only 0.6%, and most commercial ores are sulfides, especially chalcopyrite (CuFeS), bornite (CuFeS) and, to a lesser extent, covellite (CuS) and chalcocite (CuS). These minerals are concentrated from  ores to the level of 10\u201315% copper by  or . Heating this material with  in  removes much of the iron as . The process exploits the greater ease of converting iron sulfides into oxides, which in turn react with the silica to form the  slag that floats on top of the heated mass. The resulting  consisting of CuS, is  to convert all sulfides into oxides:\nThe cuprous oxide is converted to  copper upon heating:\nThe Sudbury  process converted only half the sulfide to oxide and then used this oxide to remove the rest of the sulfur as oxide. It was then electrolytically refined and the anode mud exploited for the  and gold it contained. This step exploits the relatively easy reduction of copper oxides to copper metal.  is blown across the blister to remove most of the remaining oxygen and  is performed on the resulting material to produce pure copper:\n\nLike , copper is recyclable without any loss of quality, both from raw state and from manufactured products. In volume, copper is the third most recycled metal after iron and aluminium. An estimated 80% of all copper ever mined is still in use today. According to the 's , the global per capita stock of copper in use in society is 35\u201355\u00a0kg. Much of this is in more-developed countries (140\u2013300\u00a0kg per capita) rather than less-developed countries (30\u201340\u00a0kg per capita).\nThe process of recycling copper is roughly the same as is used to extract copper but requires fewer steps. High-purity scrap copper is melted in a  and then  and cast into  and ; lower-purity scrap is refined by  in a bath of .\nNumerous copper  have been formulated, many with important uses.  is an alloy of copper and .  usually refers to copper- alloys, but can refer to any alloy of copper such as . Copper is one of the most important constituents of silver and  gold solders used in the jewelry industry, modifying the color, hardness and melting point of the resulting alloys. Some lead-free  consist of tin alloyed with a small proportion of copper and other metals.\nThe alloy of copper and , called , is used in low-denomination coins, often for the outer cladding. The US five-cent coin (currently called a ) consists of 75% copper and 25% nickel in homogeneous composition. Prior to the introduction of cupronickel, which was widely adopted by countries in the latter half of the 20th century, alloys of copper and  were also used, with the United States using an alloy of 90% silver and 10% copper until 1965, when circulating silver was removed from all coins with the exception of the Half dollar - these were debased to an alloy of 40% silver and 60% copper between 1965 and 1970. The alloy of 90% copper and 10% nickel, remarkable for its resistance to corrosion, is used for various objects exposed to seawater, though it is vulnerable to the sulfides sometimes found in polluted harbors and estuaries. Alloys of copper with aluminium (about 7%) have a golden color and are used in decorations.  is a Japanese decorative alloy of copper containing a low percentage of gold, typically 4\u201310%, that can be  to a dark blue or black color.\nCopper forms a rich variety of compounds, usually with  +1 and +2, which are often called  and , respectively. Copper compounds, whether organic  or , promote or catalyse numerous chemical and biological processes.\nAs with other elements, the simplest compounds of copper are binary compounds, i.e. those containing only two elements, the principal examples being oxides, sulfides, and . Both  and  are known. Among the numerous , important examples include  and .\nCuprous halides (with , , and ) are known, as are cupric halides with , , and .

A simplified equation is:  results in the same precipitate. Upon adding excess ammonia, the precipitate dissolves, forming :\nMany other  form complexes; these include , , and .  forms a blue crystalline penta, the most familiar copper compound in the laboratory. It is used in a  called the .\n, compounds containing more than one alcohol , generally interact with cupric salts. For example, copper salts are used to test for . Specifically, using  and  the presence of the sugar is signaled by a color change from blue Cu(II) to reddish copper(I) oxide. Schweizer's reagent and related complexes with  and other  dissolve .  form very stable  with copper(II). Many wet-chemical tests for copper ions exist, one involving , which gives a brown precipitate with copper(II) salts.\nCompounds that contain a carbon-copper bond are known as organocopper compounds. They are very reactive towards oxygen to form copper(I) oxide and have . They are synthesized by treating copper(I) compounds with ,  or ; in particular, the last reaction described produces a . These can undergo  with  to form ; as such, they are important in the field of .  is highly shock-sensitive but is an intermediate in reactions such as the  and the .  to  and  of alkynes can also be achieved with organocopper compounds. Copper(I) forms a variety of weak complexes with  and , especially in the presence of amine ligands.\nCopper(III) is most often found in oxides. A simple example is potassium , KCuO, a blue-black solid. The most extensively studied copper(III) compounds are the .  (YBaCuO) consists of both Cu(II) and Cu(III) centres. Like oxide,  is a highly   and is known to stabilize metal ions in high oxidation states. Both copper(III) and even copper(IV) fluorides are known,  and , respectively.\nSome copper proteins form , which also feature copper(III). With , purple-colored copper(III) complexes are stabilized by the deprotonated  ligands.\nComplexes of copper(III) are also found as intermediates in reactions of organocopper compounds. For example, in the .\nA timeline of copper illustrates how the metal has advanced human civilization for the past 11,000 years.\nCopper occurs naturally as  and was known to some of the oldest civilizations on record. The history of copper use dates to 9000 BC in the Middle East; a copper pendant was found in northern Iraq that dates to 8700 BC. Evidence suggests that gold and  (but not smelted iron) were the only metals used by humans before copper. The history of copper metallurgy is thought to follow this sequence: First,  of native copper, then , , and, finally, . In southeastern , all four of these techniques appear more or less simultaneously at the beginning of the  c. 7500 BC.\nCopper smelting was independently invented in different places. It was probably discovered in China before 2800 BC, in Central America around 600 AD, and in West Africa about the 9th or 10th century AD.  was invented in 4500\u20134000 BC in Southeast Asia and  has established mining at  in , UK, at 2280 to 1890 BC. , a male dated from 3300\u20133200 BC, was found with an axe with a copper head 99.7% pure; high levels of  in his hair suggest an involvement in copper smelting. Experience with copper has assisted the development of other metals; in particular, copper smelting led to the discovery of . Production in the  in Michigan and Wisconsin is dated between 6000 and 3000 BC. Natural bronze, a type of copper made from ores rich in silicon, arsenic, and (rarely) tin, came into general use in the Balkans around 5500 BC.\nAlloying copper with tin to make bronze was first practiced about 4000 years after the discovery of copper smelting, and about 2000 years after \"natural bronze\" had come into general use. Bronze artifacts from the  date to 4500 BC.  and  artifacts of copper and bronze alloys date to 3000 BC. The  began in Southeastern Europe around 3700\u20133300 BC, in Northwestern Europe about 2500 BC. It ended with the beginning of the Iron Age, 2000\u20131000 BC in the Near East, and 600 BC in Northern Europe. The transition between the  period and the Bronze Age was formerly termed the  period (copper-stone), when copper tools were used with stone tools. The term has gradually fallen out of favor because in some parts of the world, the Chalcolithic and Neolithic are coterminous at both ends. Brass, an alloy of copper and zinc, is of much more recent origin. It was known to the Greeks, but became a significant supplement to bronze during the Roman Empire.\nIn Greece, copper was known by the name  (\u03c7\u03b1\u03bb\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2). It was an important resource for the Romans, Greeks and other ancient peoples. In Roman times, it was known as ,  being the generic Latin term for copper alloys and  from , where much copper was mined. The phrase was simplified to , hence the English .  ( in Rome) represented copper in mythology and alchemy because of its lustrous beauty and its ancient use in producing mirrors; Cyprus was sacred to the goddess. The seven heavenly bodies known to the ancients were associated with the seven metals known in antiquity, and Venus was assigned to copper.\nCopper was first used in ancient Britain in about the 3rd or 2nd century BC. In North America, copper mining began with marginal workings by Native Americans. Native copper is known to have been extracted from sites on  with primitive stone tools between 800 and 1600. Copper metallurgy was flourishing in South America, particularly in Peru around 1000 AD. Copper burial ornamentals from the 15th century have been uncovered, but the metal's commercial production did not start until the early 20th century.\nThe cultural role of copper has been important, particularly in currency. Romans in the 6th through 3rd centuries BC used copper lumps as money. At first, the copper itself was valued, but gradually the shape and look of the copper became more important.  had his own coins made from brass, while 's coins were made from Cu-Pb-Sn alloys. With an estimated annual output of around 15,000\u00a0t,  reached a scale unsurpassed until the time of the ; the  most intensely mined were those of ,  and in Central Europe.\nThe gates of the  used  treated with . The process was most prevalent in , where alchemy is thought to have begun. In ancient , copper was used in the  medical science  for  instruments and other medical equipment.  () used copper for sterilizing wounds and drinking water, and later to treat headaches, burns, and itching.\nThe  was a mine in Falun, Sweden, that operated from the 10th century to 1992. It satisfied two thirds of Europe's copper consumption in the 17th century and helped fund many of Sweden's wars during that time. It was referred to as the nation's treasury; Sweden had a .\nCopper is used in roofing, currency, and for photographic technology known as the . Copper was used in  sculpture, and was used to construct the ; copper continues to be used in construction of various types.  and  were widely used to protect the under-water hulls of ships, a technique pioneered by the British  in the 18th century. The  in Hamburg was the first modern  plant, starting its production in 1876. The German scientist  invented  in 1830 while determining the metal's atomic mass; around then it was discovered that the amount and type of alloying element (e.g., tin) to copper would affect bell tones.\nDuring the rise in demand for copper for the Age of Electricity, from the 1880s until the Great Depression of the 1930s, the United States produced one third to half the world's newly mined copper. Major districts included the Keweenaw district of northern Michigan, primarily native copper deposits, which was eclipsed by the vast sulphide deposits of  in the late 1880s, which itself was eclipsed by porphyry deposits of the Souhwest United States, especially at  and . Introduction of open pit steam shovel mining and innovations in smelting, refining, flotation concentration and other processing steps led to mass production. Early in the twentieth century,  ranked first, followed by , then  and .\n was developed by  in Finland and first applied at  in 1949; the energy-efficient process accounts for 50% of the world's primary copper production.\nThe , formed in 1967 by Chile, Peru, Zaire and Zambia, operated in the copper market as  does in oil, though it never achieved the same influence, particularly because the second-largest producer, the United States, was never a member; it was dissolved in 1988.\nThe major applications of copper are electrical wire (60%), roofing and plumbing (20%), and industrial machinery (15%). Copper is used mostly as a pure metal, but when greater hardness is required, it is put into such alloys as  and  (5% of total use). For more than two centuries, copper paint has been used on boat hulls to control the growth of plants and shellfish. A small part of the copper supply is used for nutritional supplements and fungicides in agriculture.  of copper is possible, although alloys are preferred for good  in creating intricate parts.\nDespite competition from other materials, copper remains the preferred  in nearly all categories of electrical wiring except overhead  where  is often preferred. Copper wire is used in , , , ,  circuitry, and countless types of .  is the most important market for the copper industry. This includes structural power wiring, power distribution cable, appliance wire, communications cable, automotive wire and cable, and magnet wire. Roughly half of all copper mined is used for electrical wire and cable conductors. Many electrical devices rely on copper wiring because of its multitude of inherent beneficial properties, such as its high , , ,  resistance,  resistance, low , high , ease of , , and ease of installation.\nFor a short period from the late 1960s to the late 1970s, copper wiring was replaced by  in many housing construction projects in America. The new wiring was implicated in a number of house fires and the industry returned to copper.\n and  increasingly feature copper in place of aluminium because of its superior electrical conductivity;  and  use copper because of its superior heat dissipation properties. , , , and  in microwave ovens use copper, as do  for microwave radiation.\nCopper's superior  enhances the efficiency of electrical . This is important because motors and motor-driven systems account for 43%\u201346% of all global electricity consumption and 69% of all electricity used by industry. Increasing the mass and cross section of copper in a  increases the efficiency of the motor. , a new technology designed for motor applications where energy savings are prime design objectives, are enabling general-purpose  to meet and exceed  (NEMA)  standards.\nCopper has been used since ancient times as a durable, , and weatherproof architectural material. , , , , , , vaults, and  have been made from copper for hundreds or thousands of years. Copper's architectural use has been expanded in modern times to include interior and exterior , building , , and  and decorative indoor products such as attractive handrails, bathroom fixtures, and counter tops. Some of copper's other important benefits as an architectural material include low , light weight, , and recyclability\nThe metal's distinctive natural green  has long been coveted by architects and designers. The final patina is a particularly durable layer that is highly resistant to atmospheric corrosion, thereby protecting the underlying metal against further weathering. It can be a mixture of carbonate and sulfate compounds in various amounts, depending upon environmental conditions such as sulfur-containing acid rain. Architectural copper and its alloys can also be  to take on a particular look, feel, or color. Finishes include mechanical surface treatments, chemical coloring, and coatings.\nCopper has excellent  and  properties and can be ; the best results are obtained with .\nCopper is , meaning bacteria and many other forms of life will not grow on it. For this reason it has long been used to line parts of ships to protect against  and . It was originally used pure, but has since been superseded by  and copper-based paint. Similarly, as discussed in , copper alloys have become important netting materials in the  industry because they are  and prevent , even in extreme conditions and have strong structural and  properties in marine environments.\n have natural properties that destroy a wide range of  (e.g.,  O157:H7, -resistant  (), , , , , and ). Some 355 copper alloys were proven to kill more than 99.9% of disease-causing bacteria within just two hours when cleaned regularly. The  (EPA) has approved the registrations of these copper alloys as \" materials with public health benefits\"; that approval allows manufacturers to make legal claims to the public health benefits of products made of registered alloys. In addition, the EPA has approved a long list of antimicrobial copper products made from these alloys, such as bedrails, , over-bed tables, , , ,  hardware, ,  equipment, and  handles (for a comprehensive list, see: ). Copper doorknobs are used by hospitals to reduce the transfer of disease, and  is suppressed by copper tubing in plumbing systems. Antimicrobial copper alloy products are now being installed in healthcare facilities in the U.K., Ireland, Japan, Korea, France, Denmark, and Brazil and in the subway transit system in Santiago, Chile, where copper-zinc alloy handrails will be installed in some 30 stations between 2011 and 2014.\nTextile fibers can be blended with copper to create antimicrobial protective fabrics.\nCopper may be used as a speculative investment due to the predicted increase in use from worldwide infrastructure growth, and the important role it has in producing , , and other renewable energy sources. Another reason predicted demand increases is the fact that  contain an average of 3.6 times as much copper as conventional cars, although the effect of  on copper demand is debated. Some people invest in copper through copper mining stocks, , and . Others store physical copper in the form of copper bars or rounds although these tend to carry a higher premium in comparison to precious metals. Those who want to avoid the premiums of copper  alternatively store old ,  or American .\nCopper is commonly used in jewelry, and according to some folklore, copper bracelets relieve  symptoms. In one trial for osteoarthritis and one trial for rheumatoid arthritis no differences is found between copper bracelet and control (non-copper) bracelet. No evidence shows that copper can be absorbed through the skin. If it were, it might lead to .\nRecently, some  clothing with inter-woven copper has been marketed with health claims similar to the folk medicine claims.

Instead of reversibly binding oxygen, these proteins hydroxylate substrates, illustrated by their role in the formation of . The biological role for copper commenced with the appearance of oxygen in earth's atmosphere. Several copper proteins, such as the \"blue copper proteins\", do not interact directly with substrates; hence they are not enzymes. These proteins relay electrons by the process called .\nA unique tetranuclear copper center has been found in .\nChemical compounds which were developed for treatment of Wilson's disease have been investigated for use in cancer therapy.\nCopper is an essential  in plants and animals, but not all microorganisms. The human body contains copper at a level of about 1.4 to 2.1\u00a0mg per kg of body mass.\nCopper is absorbed in the gut, then transported to the liver bound to . After processing in the liver, copper is distributed to other tissues in a second phase, which involves the protein , carrying the majority of copper in blood. Ceruloplasmin also carries the copper that is excreted in milk, and is particularly well-absorbed as a copper source. Copper in the body normally undergoes  (about 5\u00a0mg a day, vs. about 1\u00a0mg per day absorbed in the diet and excreted from the body), and the body is able to excrete some excess copper, if needed, via , which carries some copper out of the liver that is not then reabsorbed by the intestine.\nThe  (IOM) updated the estimated average requirements (EARs) and recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) for copper in 2001. If there is not sufficient information to establish EARs and RDAs, an estimate designated  (AI) is used instead. The AIs for copper are: 200\u00a0\u03bcg of copper for 0\u20136-month-old males and females, and 220\u00a0\u03bcg of copper for 7\u201312-month-old males and females. For both sexes, the RDAs for copper are: 340\u00a0\u03bcg of copper for 1\u20133 years old, 440\u00a0\u03bcg of copper for 4\u20138 years old, 700\u00a0\u03bcg of copper for 9\u201313 years old, 890\u00a0\u03bcg of copper for 14\u201318 years old and 900\u00a0\u03bcg of copper for ares 19 years and older. For pregnancy, 1,000\u00a0\u03bcg. For lactation, 1,300\u00a0\u03bcg. As for safety, the IOM also sets  (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of copper the UL is set at 10\u00a0mg/day. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as .\nThe  (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL defined the same as in United States. For women and men ages 18 and older the AIs are set at 1.3 and 1.6\u00a0mg/day, respectively. AIs for pregnancy and lactation is 1.5\u00a0mg/day. For children ages 1\u201317 years the AIs increase with age from 0.7 to 1.3\u00a0mg/day. These AIs are higher than the U.S. RDAs. The European Food Safety Authority reviewed the same safety question and set its UL at 5\u00a0mg/day, which is half the U.S. value.\nFor U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV). For copper labeling purposes 100% of the Daily Value was 2.0\u00a0mg, but as of May\u00a027, 2016 it was revised to 0.9\u00a0mg to bring it into agreement with the RDA. Compliance with the updated labeling regulations was required by 1 January 2020, for manufacturers with $10 million or more in annual food sales, and by 1 January 2021, for manufacturers with less than $10 million in annual food sales. During the first six months following the 1 January 2020 compliance date, the FDA plans to work cooperatively with manufacturers to meet the new Nutrition Facts label requirements and will not focus on enforcement actions regarding these requirements during that time.

The \"cytochrome c oxidase activity of leucocytes and platelets\" has been stated as another factor in deficiency, but the results have not been confirmed by replication.\nGram quantities of various copper salts have been taken in suicide attempts and produced acute copper toxicity in humans, possibly due to redox cycling and the generation of  that damage . Corresponding amounts of copper salts (30\u00a0mg/kg) are toxic in animals. A minimum dietary value for healthy growth in rabbits has been reported to be at least 3  in the diet. However, higher concentrations of copper (100 ppm, 200 ppm, or 500 ppm) in the diet of rabbits may favorably influence , growth rates, and carcass dressing percentages.\nChronic copper toxicity does not normally occur in humans because of transport systems that regulate absorption and excretion. Autosomal recessive mutations in copper transport proteins can disable these systems, leading to  with copper accumulation and  of the liver in persons who have inherited two defective genes.\nElevated copper levels have also been linked to worsening symptoms of .\nIn the US, the  (OSHA) has designated a  (PEL) for copper dust and fumes in the workplace as a time-weighted average (TWA) of 1\u00a0mg/m.

Additionally, older batteries contain   and , harmful materials that must be handled with care. Because of their potential environmental damage, proper disposal of used batteries is required by law in many areas. Unfortunately, this mandate has been difficult to enforce.\nLead-acid batteries, like those used in , are relatively easy to recycle and many regions have legislation requiring vendors to accept used products. In the United States, the recycling rate is 90%, with new batteries containing up to 80% recycled material.\nJapan, , the USA, Canada, France, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Sweden, the UK and Ireland all actively encourage  battery recycling programs.  In 2006, the EU passed the  of which one of the aims is a higher rate of battery recycling. The  directive said at least 25% of all the EU's used batteries must be collected by 2012, and rising to no less than 45% by 2016, of which, that at least 50% of them must be recycled.\nKitchen, garden, and other  can be recycled into useful material by  into  and regular compost. This process allows natural  to break down the waste into fertile . Much composting is done on a household scale, but municipal green-waste collection programs also exist. These programs can supplement their funding by selling the topsoil produced.\nElectronic recycling is recycling or reuse of  or other electronics. It includes both finding another use for materials (such as donation to ), and having systems dismantled in a manner that allows for the safe extraction of the constituent materials for reuse in other products. The direct disposal of electrical equipment\u2014such as old  and  is banned in many areas, such as the UK, parts of the USA, Japan, Ireland, Germany and the Netherlands, due to the toxic contents of certain components. The recycling process works by mechanically separating the metals, plastics, and  contained in the appliance. When this is done on a large scale at an electronic waste recycling plant, component recovery can be achieved cost-effectively.\nWith high  content in , and the rapid diffusion of new flat-panel display technologies, some of which () use lamps containing , there is growing concern about  from discarded televisions. Related  concerns exist, as well, for disassemblers and  removing  wiring and other materials from CRTs. Further environmental concerns related to television design and use relate to the devices' increasing  requirements.\nComputers that are termed  in North America or  in the UK and Ireland are computer equipment that has assembled from old , using cleaned and checked parts from different computers, for use by disadvantaged people to bridge the . Trashware is different from , which has only cultural and recreational purposes.\nBecause printer cartridges from the original manufacturer are often , demand exists for cheaper . These include ink sold in bulk, , machines in stores that automatically refill cartridges, re-manufactured cartridges, and cartridges made by a  other than the original manufacturer.\nConsumers can refill  themselves with a kit, or they can take the cartridge to a refiller or re-manufacturer where ink is pumped back into the cartridge.  reports that refilled cartridges have higher failure rates, print fewer pages than new cartridges, and demonstrate more on-page problems like streaking, curling, and colour bleed.\nA wide range of metals in commercial and domestic use have well developed recycling markets in most developed countries.  Domestic recycling is commonly available for  and ,  and in particular  and food . In addition, building metals such as ,  and  are readily recyclable through specialised companies. In the UK, these are usually either specialised  dealers or car breakers. Other metals present in smaller quantities in the domestic waste stream such as  and  are also extracted from metal put into the recycling system but are rarely recovered from the general waste stream.\n and  can be recycled by reducing it to  and combining it with pulp from newly harvested . As the recycling process causes the paper fibres to break down, each time paper is recycled its quality decreases. This means that either a higher percentage of new fibres must be added, or the paper down-cycled into lower quality products. Any writing or colouration of the paper must first be removed by , which also removes fillers, clays, and fibre fragments.\nAlmost all paper can be recycled today, but some types are harder to recycle than others. Papers coated with plastic or aluminium foil, and papers that are waxed, pasted, or gummed are usually not recycled because the process is too expensive.\nSometimes recyclers ask for the removal of the  inserts from  because they are a different type of paper. Glossy inserts have a heavy clay coating that some paper mills cannot accept. Most of the clay is removed from the recycled pulp as sludge, which must be disposed of. If the  is 20% by weight clay, then each ton of glossy paper produces more than 200\u00a0kg of sludge and less than 800\u00a0kg of fibre.\nThe price of  has varied greatly over the last 30 or so years.\n\n The German price of \u20ac100/\u00a349 per tonne was typical for the year 2003  and it steadily rose over the years. By the September 2008 saw the American price of $235 per ton, which had fallen to just $120 per ton, and in the January 2009, the UK's fell six weeks from about \u00a370.00 per ton, to only \u00a310.00 per ton. The slump was probably due to the economic down turn in  leading to market for waste paper drying up in . 2010 averaged at $120.32 over the start of the year, but saw a rapid rise global prices in May 2010, with the June 2010 resting $217.11 per ton in the USA as China's paper market began to reopen!\nMexico, America, the , Russia and Japan all recycle paper en masse and there are many state run and private schemes running in those countries. \nIn 2004 the paper recycling rate in Europe was 54.6% or 45.5\u00a0million short tons (41.3\u00a0Mt). The recycling rate in Europe reached 64.5%3 in 2007, which confirms that the industry is on the path to meeting its voluntary target of 66% by 2010.\nPlastic recycling is the process of recovering scrap or waste plastics and reprocessing the material into useful products. Compared to glass or metallic materials, plastic poses unique challenges. Because of the massive number of , they each carry a , and must be sorted before they can be recycled. This can be costly; while metals can be sorted using electromagnets, no such 'easy sorting' capability exists for plastics. In addition to this, while labels do not need to be removed from bottles for recycling, lids are often made from a different kind of non-recyclable plastic.\nTo help in identifying the materials in various plastic items, resin identification code numbers 1-6 have been assigned to six common kinds of recyclable plastic resins, with the number 7 indicating any other kind of plastic, whether recyclable or not.   are available incorporating each of these resin codes.\nTire recycling or rubber recycling is the process of recycling vehicles  that are no longer suitable for use on vehicles. These tyres are among the largest and most problematic sources of , due to the large volume produced and their durability. Those same characteristics which make waste tyres such a problem also make them one of the most re-used waste materials, as the  is very resilient and can be reused in other products.  In the United States, approximately one tyre is discarded per person per year. However, material recovered from , known as \"crumb\" is generally only a cheap \"filler\" material and is rarely used in high volumes.  is also fairly common. Used tires can be added to  for producing road surfaces or to make  used on ,  and new shoe products. They are also often used as the insulation and heat absorbing/releasing material in specially constructed homes known as . It is arguable that  in applications such as  courts could be better described as \"reused\" rubber rather than \"recycled\".\n is a type of  involving breaking up ships for  recycling, with the hulls being discarded in . Most ships have a lifespan of a few decades before there is so much wear that refitting and repair becomes uneconomical. Ship breaking allows materials from the ship, especially steel, to be reused. Equipment on board the vessel can also be reused. Until the late 20th century, ship breaking took place in port cities of  such as the United Kingdom and the United States.  Today, most ship breaking yards are in  in India,  in ,  in Turkey and  near  in Pakistan. Ship breaking is one example that has associated environmental, health, and safety risks for the area where the operation takes place; balancing all these considerations is an  problem.\nIn many countries, there is an active market in re-selling used clothes. In Britain, this dominated by  shops who sell donated clean clothes. Less saleable clothes are put into the re-cycling waste stream.  \n are made of a variety of materials including , , synthetic plastics, ,  and a variety of other materials. The textile's composition will affect its durability and method of recycling.\nTextiles entering the re-cycling stream are sorted and separated by  into good quality clothing and shoes which can be reused or worn. There is a trend of moving these facilities from developed countries to developing countries either for charity or sold at a cheaper price. Many international organisations collect used textiles from developed countries as a donation to those third world countries. This recycling practise is encouraged because it helps to reduce unwanted waste while providing clothing to those in need.\nDamaged textiles are further sorted into grades to make industrial wiping cloths and for use in high quality paper manufacture or material suitable for fibre reclamation and filling products. If textile reprocessors receive wet or soiled clothes, however, these may still be disposed of in a landfill, as the washing and drying facilities may not be present at sorting units.\nFibre reclamation mills sort textiles according to fibre type and colour. Colour sorting eliminates the need to re-dye the recycled textiles. The textiles are shredded into \"shoddy\" fibres and blended with other selected fibres, depending on the intended end use of the recycled yarn. The blended mixture is carded to clean and mix the fibres and spun ready for weaving or knitting. The fibres can also be compressed for mattress production. Textiles sent to the flocking industry are shredded to make  for , , ,  and .\nAccording to Earth911.com, \"Metal hangers, while made of steel, can be difficult to recycle because their hooks can damage recycling equipment and some have a petroleum coating. Some curbside recycling programs do accept them.... Many dry cleaners take back hangers, too....\"\nIn North America, mine  waste can be used on snow-covered roads to improve ; as ; and as , principally for , highway construction, and  production.  and to a lesser degree  have been used in lieu of construction and railway ballast gravel in the UK. , ,  and in some cases ashes have all  been used in places such as the  parts of   and  to make domestic  paths.\n"},

The process involves simply re-melting the metal, which is far less expensive and energy-intensive than creating new aluminium through the  of  (), which must first be mined from  ore and then refined using the .  scrap aluminium requires only 5% of the energy used to make new aluminium from the raw ore. For this reason, approximately 36% of all aluminium produced in the  comes from old recycled scrap. Used beverage containers are the largest component of processed aluminum scrap, and most of it is manufactured back into aluminium cans.\nA common practice since the early 1900s and extensively capitalized during , aluminium recycling is not new. It was, however, a low-profile activity until the late 1960s, when the exploding popularity of aluminium  finally placed recycling into the public consciousness.\nSources for recycled aluminium include , , , , , , , , , and many other products that need a strong lightweight material, or a material with high . As recycling does not transmute the element, aluminium can be recycled indefinitely and still be used to produce any product for which new aluminium could have been used.\nAluminium is an infinitely recyclable material, and it takes up to 95 percent less energy to recycle it than to produce primary aluminum, which also limits emissions, including greenhouse gases. Today, about 75 percent of all aluminum produced in history, nearly a billion tons, is still in use.\nThe recycling of aluminium generally produces significant cost savings over the production of new aluminium, even when the cost of collection, separation and recycling are taken into account. Over the long term, even larger national savings are made when the reduction in the capital costs associated with , mines, and international  of raw aluminium are considered.\nRecycling aluminium uses about 5% of the energy required to create aluminium from ; the amount of energy required to convert  into aluminium can be vividly seen when the process is reversed during the combustion of  or . \nAluminium die extrusion is a specific way of getting reusable material from aluminium scraps but does not require a large energy output of a melting process. In 2003, half of the products manufactured with aluminium were sourced from recycled aluminium material.\nThe benefit with respect to emissions of carbon dioxide depends on the type of energy used.  can be done using electricity from non-fossil-fuel sources, such as nuclear, geothermal, hydroelectric, or solar. Aluminium production is attracted to sources of cheap electricity. Canada, Brazil, Norway, and Venezuela have 61 to 99%  power and are major aluminium producers. The use of recycled aluminium also decreases the need for mining bauxite.\nThe vast amount of aluminium used means that even small percentage losses are large expenses, so the flow of material is well monitored and accounted for financial reasons. Efficient production and recycling benefits the environment as well.\nAluminium beverage cans are usually recycled by the following method:\nThe scrap aluminium is separated into a range of categories such as irony aluminium (engine blocks etc.), clean aluminium (alloy wheels). Scraps are classified according to ISRI (Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries).\nDepending on the specification of the required ingot casting, it will depend on the type of scrap used in the start melt. Generally, the scrap is charged to a  (other methods appear to be either less economical and/or dangerous) and melted down to form a \"bath\". The molten metal is tested using  on a sample taken from the melt to determine what refinements are needed to produce the final casts.\nAfter the refinements have been added, the melt may be tested several times to be able to fine-tune the batch to the specific standard.\nOnce the correct \"recipe\" of metal is available, the furnace is tapped and poured into ingot moulds, usually via a casting machine. The melt is then left to cool, stacked and sold on as cast silicon\u2013aluminium ingot to various industries for re-use. Mainly, cast alloys like ADC12, LM2, AlSi132, LM24 etc. are produced. These secondary alloys ingots are used in die cast companies.\nTilting rotary furnaces are used for recycling of aluminium scrap, which give higher recovery compared to reverberatory furnaces (Skelner Furnace).\n 98.2% of its aluminium can production, equivalent to 14.7 billion beverage cans per year, ranking first in the world, more than Japan's . Brazil has topped the aluminium can recycling charts eight years in a row.\nWhite dross, a residue from primary aluminium production and secondary recycling operations, usually classified as waste, still contains useful quantities of aluminium which can be extracted industrially. The process produces aluminium billets, together with a highly complex waste material. This waste is difficult to manage. It reacts with water, releasing a mixture of gases (including, among others, , , and ) which spontaneously ignites on contact with air; contact with damp air results in the release of copious quantities of ammonia gas. Despite these difficulties, however, the waste has found use as a filler in  and .\n\n"},

There are some notable limitations of recycled cotton, including separation of materials that are cotton/ mix. There may also be limits to durability in using recycled cotton.\n can be  from pre-consumer (post-industrial) and post-consumer cotton waste. Pre-consumer waste comes from any excess material produced during the production of , fabrics and textile products, e.g.  from weaving and fabric remnants from factory cutting rooms.  comes from discarded textile products, e.g. used apparel and home textiles. During the recycling process, the cotton waste is first sorted by type and color and then processed through stripping machines that break the yarns and fabric into smaller pieces before pulling them apart into fiber. The mix is carded several times in order to clean and mix the fibers before they are spun into new yarns.\nThe resulting staple fiber is shorter than the original fiber length, meaning it is more difficult to spin. Recycled cotton is therefore often blended with virgin cotton fibers to improve yarn strengths. Commonly, not more than 30% recycled cotton content is used in the finished yarn or fabric.\nBecause waste cotton is often already dyed, re-dyeing may not be necessary. Cotton is an extremely resource-intense crop in terms of water, pesticides and insecticides. This means that using recycled cotton can lead to significant savings of natural resources and reduce pollution from agriculture. Recycling one tonne of cotton can save 765 cubic metres (202,000 US gal) of water.\nRecycled cotton is often combined with   to make clothing and textiles, creating sustainable, earth-conscious products. Recycled cotton can also be used in industrial settings as polishing and wiper cloths and can even be made into new, high-quality . When reduced to its fibrous state, cotton can be used for applications like seat stuffing or home and automotive insulation. It is also sold as recycled cotton yarn for consumers to create their own items. Additionally, cotton waste can be made into a stronger, more durable paper than traditional wood-pulp based paper, which may contain high concentration of acids. Cotton paper is often used for important documents and also for  since it does not wear off as easily. Cotton waste can also be used to grow mushrooms (particularly the indoor cultivation of  otherwise known as Straw Mushrooms).\nEven though recycling cotton cuts down on the harsh process of creating brand new cotton products, it is a natural fiber and is , so any cotton fibers that cannot be recycled or used further can be composted and will not take up space in landfills.\n"},

When asphalt pavement material is reclaimed for reuse, it is able to replace both virgin  and virgin . Similarly, asphalt  can be recycled for use in new asphalt pavements.\nGlass bottles and jars are gathered by a curbside collection truck and bottle banks, where the glass may be sorted into color categories. The collected glass  is taken to a glass recycling plant where it is monitored for purity and contaminants are removed. The cullet is crushed and added to a raw material mix in a melting furnace. It is then mechanically blown or molded into new jars or bottles. Glass cullet is also used in the construction industry for aggregate and glassphalt.  is a road-laying material which comprises around 30% recycled glass. Glass can be recycled indefinitely as its structure does not deteriorate when reprocessed.\nAluminium is one of the most efficient and widely recycled materials.  is shredded and ground into small pieces or crushed into bales. These pieces or bales are melted in an aluminium smelter to produce molten aluminium. By this stage, the recycled aluminium is indistinguishable from virgin aluminium and further processing is identical for both. This process does not produce any change in the metal, so aluminium can be recycled indefinitely.\nRecycling aluminium saves 95%\u00a0of the energy cost of processing new aluminium. This is because the temperature necessary for melting recycled, nearly pure, aluminium is 600\u00a0\u00b0C, while to extract mined aluminium from its ore requires 900\u00a0\u00b0C. To reach this higher temperature, much more energy is needed, leading to the high environmental benefits of aluminium recycling. Americans throw away enough aluminium every year to rebuild their entire commercial air fleet. Also, the energy saved by recycling one aluminium can is enough to run a television for three hours.\nLike aluminium, copper is 100% recyclable without any loss of quality, regardless of whether it is in a raw state or contained in a manufactured product. In volume, copper is the third most recycled metal after iron and aluminium.\nIron and steel are the world's most recycled materials, and among the easiest materials to reprocess, as they can be separated magnetically from the waste stream. Recycling is via a steelworks: scrap is either remelted in an  (90-100%\u00a0scrap), or used as part of the charge in a Basic Oxygen Furnace (around 25%\u00a0scrap). Any grade of steel can be recycled to top quality new metal, with no 'downgrading' from prime to lower quality materials as steel is recycled repeatedly. 42%\u00a0of crude steel produced is recycled material.\nFor information about recycling other, less common metals, refer to:\nThe vast majority of plastic is non-biodegradable, so recycling is a part of global efforts to reduce plastic in the waste stream. There are many types of plastic and they generally have to be separated by type for successful recycling. The low density of plastics increases transportation costs per unit weight.\nRecycling timber has become popular due to its image as an  product, with consumers commonly believing that by purchasing recycled wood the demand for  will fall and ultimately benefit the environment.  also view recycled timber as an environmentally friendly product, citing it as the most preferable timber source on their website.

It is organised into eight directorates that report to the chief executive.\nThere are two \"policy and process\" directorates. One deals with Flood and Coastal Risk Management and the other with Environment and Business. These are backed up by the Evidence directorate. The fourth directorate is a single Operations \"delivery\" unit, responsible for national services, and  of all the Regional and Area staff.\nThe remaining directorates are central shared service groups for Finance, Legal Services, Resources and Communications.\nIn support of its aims, the Agency acts as an , a  and a  authority.\nThe agency is funded in part from the UK government  (DEFRA). Additional money is raised from the issuing of licences and permits such as abstraction licences, waste handler registrations, navigation rights and rod (fishing) licences and from licensing data for which the Agency is owner.\nFunding for  and improvement and acquisition of flood risk management assets has traditionally come from local authorities via Flood Defence Committees. This was then effectively repaid by  in later years as part of the Formula Spending Share. In 2005 this was simplified by making a direct transfer from Treasury to the Environment Agency in the form of Flood Defence .\nThe Environment Agency's total funding in 2007\u201308 was \u00a31,025 million, an increase of \u00a323 million on 2006\u201307. Of that total, \u00a3629 million (61 per cent) was provided in the form of 'flood defence grant-in-aid' from government (\u00a3578 million for England and \u00a350 million for Wales). In addition, \u00a3347 million (34 per cent) was raised through statutory charging schemes and flood defence levies; and a further \u00a350 million (5 per cent) came from other miscellaneous sources.\nIn 2007\u201308 had an operational budget of \u00a31.025 billion, of which \u00a3628m was grant from the Agency's sponsoring Government Departments.

Its chief executive is Sir James Bevan.\n resigned as chairman on 11 January 2016, with Emma Howard Boyd becoming acting chair. Emma Howard Boyd took up the post of Chair formally on 19 September 2016.\nThe Environment Agency was created by the , and came into existence on 1 April 1996. It had responsibility for the whole of England and Wales but with specifically designated border arrangements with Scotland covering the catchment of the . It took over the roles and responsibilities of the  (NRA),  (HMIP) and the waste regulation authorities in England and Wales including the London Waste Regulation Authority (LWRA). All of the predecessor bodies were disbanded and the local authorities relinquished their  role. At the same time, the Agency took responsibility for issuing flood warnings to the public, a role previously held by the police.\nIn 2010 a new national headquarters for the agency was opened at Horizon House in Deanery Road, . The building, which was designed by Alec French Architects, won the  Environmental Assessment () Award for its environmentally friendly construction and operation which includes the use of sustainable materials, natural ventilation and cooling,  and .\nOn 24 April 2013, Horizon House suffered a fire leading to its closure for several weeks. An investigation into the fire found it was that result of workmen accidentally igniting the environmentally friendly cavity wall insulation on the ground floor and due to the design of the upward airflow the fire spread quickly in the inside of the wall leading to substantial smoke damage throughout. The building was quickly evacuated and the fire under control in under and hour. The resulting internal document proposed additional standards for the handling of materials that offer environmental advantages but may be considered more susceptible to ignition.\nOn 1 April 2013, that part of the  was merged into , a separate body managing the Welsh environment and natural resources.\nThe Environment Agency is the principal flood risk management . It has the power (but not the legal obligation) to manage flood risk from designated  and the sea. These functions in relation to other rivers (defined as ) in England are undertaken by Local Authorities or . The Environment Agency is also responsible for increasing public awareness of flood risk,  and warning and has a general supervisory duty for flood risk management. As of 2008 the Environment Agency also has a strategic overview role for all  and  risk management. The term \"Flood Risk Management\" in place of \"Flood Defence\" recognises that managed flooding is essential to meet the requirements of a sustainable flood strategy. It is often not economically feasible or even desirable to prevent all forms of flooding in all locations, and so the Environment Agency uses its powers to reduce either the  or consequences of flooding.\nThe Environment Agency is responsible for operating, maintaining and replacing an estimated \u00a320 billion worth of flood risk management (FRM) installations. According to a report by consultants in 2001, these are estimated to prevent annual average damage costs of approximately \u00a33.5 billion. The Agency also invests in improving or providing new installations in areas where there remains a high risk of flooding, particularly where, because of the possible consequences, the damage risk is the highest.

The Environment Agency carries out an advisory function in development control \u2013 commenting on planning applications within flood risk areas, providing advice to assist planning authorities in ensuring that any development is carried out in line with the National Planning Policy Framework. The agency provides technical advice on the  that must be submitted with most planning applications in flood risk areas. The Agency also runs public awareness campaigns to inform those at risk who may be unaware that they live in an area that is prone to flooding, as well as providing information about what the flood warning codes and symbols mean and how to respond in the event of a flood. The agency operates , a 24-hour telephone  on flooding.

If prosecuted in the , there is no limit on the amount of the fine and sentences of up to 5\u00a0years imprisonment may be imposed on those responsible for the pollution or on Directors of companies causing pollution.\nThe Agency has an important role in conservation and ecology specifically along rivers and in wetlands. More general responsibility for the countryside and natural environment in England falls to the organisation . The Environment Agency's activities support users of the rivers and wetlands, including anglers and boaters.\nThe Agency states that they take a \"leading role in limiting and preparing for the impacts of climate change.\"\nThe Agency is a regulator for the release of  into the atmosphere from large, complex industrial processes. This will soon include  from some large-scale agricultural activities, but air pollutant releases from many agricultural activities will continue to be unregulated.\nMajor sources of air pollution, such as transport, are subject to various measures at the European, national and local level. Local authorities regulate air pollution from smaller industrial processes. The Agency works with local authorities, the  and others to implement the UK government's air quality strategy in England as mandated in the . The Environment Agency has an Air Quality Modelling and Assessment Unit (AQMAU) that aims to ensure that air quality assessments for permit applications, enforcement and air pollution incident investigations are consistent, of a high standard and based on sound science.\nThe Agency is the regulatory authority for all  activities including the licensing of sites such as ,  and recycling facilities. It also regulates the movement of hazardous wastes such as ,  and harmful chemicals. The Agency issues Environmental Permits to waste management sites and any individuals or companies found to have caused pollution or have infringed their licence conditions can be prosecuted. In serious cases the Environment Agency has the power to revoke the Environmental Permits issued to sites that contravene the conditions of their permits stopping all waste handling activities.\nThe Agency has a duty to maintain and improve the quality of surface waters and ground-waters and, as part of the duty, it monitors the quality of rivers, lakes, the sea and groundwater on a regular basis. Much of this information is required by law under the provisions of a number of  to be reported both to Parliament and to Europe and to be made public. Some of these duties have been in force through predecessor agencies and as a consequence the Agency maintains some long term data sets which in some cases such as the  exceed 30 years of consistent data collection.\nMonitoring is also carried out of many discharges to the aquatic environment including sewage effluents and trade and agricultural discharges.\nThe Agency manages the use and conservation of water through the issue of  licences for activities such as drinking water supply, artificial  and  generation.

Action, in several policy areas, is directed towards business and commerce at all levels, children in education, the general public and Government and local government. This last area is quite distinct from the Agency's statutory role to advise Government.\nIn local government planning processes, the Environment Agency is a statutory consultee on all planning matters from County Strategic plans down to individual planning applications. In reality only those applications judged to pose special risks to the environment are commented on in any detail. For many years the Agency has been offering strong advice against the development of land in  because of the risk of flooding. Whilst in some instances, this advice may not have been appreciated in its entirety, in a large number of cases this advice has been used to reach decisions on planning applications.\nThe Environment Agency is also an advisory board member of the  at .\nUntil the formation of the Environment Agency, the Government took specialist advice on the management of the environment from civil servants employed in appropriate ministries. This led to considerable duplication of effort and frequent disagreements between Government and the regulatory agencies. The Environment Agency now advises Government directly about those issues within its purview.\nThe operational arm of the Environment Agency consists of 14 areas, all of which report to the Director of Operations. As of April 2014, the Environment Agency removed its regional level of administration (formerly Anglian Region, Midlands Region, North West Region, South East Region, South West Region and Yorkshire & North East Region) to be replaced by an \"area once, national once\" model. The 14 area names were also changed to better reflect the areas that they serve. The new area names are:\n- North East Area\n- Cumbria and Lancashire\n- Yorkshire\n- Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire\n- Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire\n- Greater Manchester, Merseyside and Cheshire\n- West Midlands (Staffordshire, Warwickshire, West Midlands, Shropshire, Herefordshire, Worcestershire and Gloucestershire) \n- Wessex\n- Devon and Cornwall\n- East Anglia (Cambridgeshire, Bedfordshire, Essex, Norfolk and Suffolk) \n- Hertfordshire and North London\n- West Thames\n- Solent and South Downs\n- Kent and South London\nSince the establishment of the Environment Agency several major flood events have occurred and the Agency has been the target of criticism. A number of reports have been produced which chart various developments in flood management.\nAt Easter 1998, the equivalent of one months rain fell in the Midlands in 24 hours and flooding caused \u00a3400m damage and five deaths. In the light of criticism, the Agency commissioned a report from a review team under the Chairmanship of Peter Bye, a former chief executive of Suffolk CC. The report concluded that in many respects, the Environment Agency's policies, plans and operational arrangements were sound, and that staff did their best in extreme circumstances, but there were instances of unsatisfactory planning, inadequate warnings for the public, incomplete defences and poor co-ordination with emergency services. Specifically the report highlighted the flood warning system and said the scale of the damage could have been avoided if the agency had issued more advice to those living in the worst affected areas and noted  \"People who do not understand what they can do to protect themselves when they are warned are not protected.\"\nIn the , damage was reduced by flood defences and by timely warnings and evacuations where the defences could not hold back the water. As a result, 280,000 properties were protected from the floods, but over 10,000 properties were still flooded at an estimated cost of \u00a31 billion. Defra commissioned an independent review by the  under George Fleming. The review was to consider methods of estimating and reducing flood risk and look at whether flood risk management could make more use of natural processes. Other terms of reference included the possible  and experience of other countries. The resulting report entitled  specifically criticised a reluctance to use computer models and inadequate representation of the dynamic effects of land use, catchment processes and climatic variability. More broadly, the report noted that sustainable flood risk management could only be achieved by working with the natural response of the river basin and by providing the necessary storage, flow reduction and discharge capacity. It concluded that floods can only be managed, not prevented, and the community must learn to live with rivers.\nOn 15 June 2007 the  produced a report on the performance of the Environment Agency with respect to its administrative targets and information systems. The report highlighted that the Environment Agency had not reached its targets for maintaintaining flood defence systems and producing catchment area plans, and that since 2001 the general conditions of assets had not improved significantly. It concluded the agency could reduce the need for extra funding by improving cost effectiveness.\nOn the basis of the report, and to the background of the Summer 2007 floods, on 27 June 2007 the  under  subjected the Environment Agency management to severe interrogation and concluded that the agency had \"not delivered protection for the British people\". Issuing a strong response, the chief executive rejected the charge that the Environment Agency has massively failed, as alleged in the commons public accounts committee, noting that in the last seven years, defences had been created to protect 100,000 homes in floodplains, numbers receiving flood warning had dramatically increased and greatly improved flood mapping and forecasting had been implemented.\nFollowing the , which left 13 people dead, 44,600 homes flooded and caused \u00a33bn damage,  announced an independent review by .\nThe Environment Agency directors attracted criticism when it emerged that shortly before the floods they had received five-figure \"performance bonuses\", with numerous calls for the bonuses to be donated to flood relief funds. An opposition spokesperson raised a question over the timing of the release of the information\u2014\"just as MPs left for their 11-week summer recess\u2014guaranteeing minimum parliamentary scrutiny\".\nPitt's review, published in full in June 2008 contained 92 recommendations looking at all aspects of the \"biggest civil emergency in British history\". Of these, thirteen were directed at the Environment Agency, the first of which stated that the Environment Agency should take on a national overview of all flood risk (2). It recommended the Environment Agency should further develop its modelling tools and techniques working with its partners on such (4)(5), and also make flood visualisation data more accessible (36)(37). It recommended closer working with the  (6)(34)(35)(65). The Agency should provide a more specific flood warning system for infrastructure operators (33), work with local responders to raise awareness in flood risk areas (61) and work with telecoms companies to roll out telephone flood warning schemes. Other recommendations were that the Environment Agency should continue its existing processes (8)(25).\nThe review also argued that the Government's \u00a3800 million-a-year flood defence budget for 2010 to 2011 was \"about right\" but stated that money should be spent more wisely. Sir Michael Pitt said: \"What we are arguing is that we were not well prepared last summer for the scale of flooding that took place.\"\nAfter the 2007 floods, the present organisation of flood management in England and Wales, with a large number of separate bodies responsible for different components, was called into question. George Fleming, who chaired the committee which produced the  report argued that the Environment Agency had too many roles and faced too great a conflict between its roles as habitat protector and planning regulator and suggested it was time to break it up and create a dedicated Flood Management Agency. On leaving her post as CEO in June 2008 Barbara Young responded to these suggestions, predicting that the Pitt report was unlikely to recommend the break-up of the Environment Agency.\nThe Environment Agency and its then chair  was involved with a row with   and other members of the government, and landowners and residents in . The row focused on the flooding of the  and whether the  should be .\nThe Environment Agency, responsible for main river maintenance, was criticised for failures which led to flooding following a period of heavy rainfall in December 2015 (, ) across northern England and parts of Scotland. In particular, the decision to open a barrier on the  resulted in flooding of supposedly protected houses. This wasn't a decision taken lightly however, there was a strong chance the barrier could have broken down while closed leading to a much greater risk of flooding. Additionally, the Environment Agency was accused of misleading the public by stating that its chairman  was \"at home with his family\" when he was at his wife's family home in Barbados. In the days following the floods, it was reported that Agency staff responsible for protecting the UK from flooding were paid almost \u00a3300,000 in bonuses or received large payoffs in 2015, including the Environment Agency's publicity chief who led the press team who tried to cover-up their Chairman's absence; Pam Gilder quit with a \u00a3112,000 pay-off.\nThe extent of damage caused in such a short period across wide areas has brought into focus the overall performance of UK central government flood defence strategies. Expensive flood defence systems were proven ineffective and in some cases appeared to increase the problem. Professor Dieter Helm, Chair of the UK government's Natural Capital Committee stated in January 2016: \"Flooding crises tend to follow an established pattern. First, there is immediate help and assistance. Then second, there is a \"review\". On occasions, this leads to a third stage of genuine reform, but in most cases \"sticking plasters\" are applied. These are incremental and often sensible, but typically fail to address the core issues and hence provide only a temporary respite. There are very good reasons why \"sticking plasters\" will not work this time. The conventional approach to flood defence, carried out by the Environment Agency (EA), and financed largely by the Treasury, is at best inefficient. Sometimes it is even counterproductive, encouraging the sorts of land use and land management decisions that can actually make flooding worse in the medium term.\"\nThe UK government House of Commons Select Committee for the environment challenged the Chief Executive Officer of the Environment Agency on its performance by stating: \"You [Sir James Bevan, CEO] said \"The capacity of a river doesn't matter!\" You've got to be certain the leopard has changed its spots. And I will keep repeating this. You haven't really given us an answer as to whether you have monitored the situation. I'm fearful. You allowed the River Parrett [Somerset] to silt up, you allowed the Tone to silt up, you allowed the tributaries to silt up, and then it flooded.\" The Committee added: \"The EA don't provide [quotes for work] when doing projects so we can't compare like with like [with other project providers]. There is an argument for transparency on your spending... You say the right words and hold onto your power.\"\nSir Philip Dilley resigned as chairman of the Environment Agency on 11 January 2016. Dilley stated he was stepping down because \"expectations\" of his role have changed to mean he has to be \"available at short notice throughout the year\".\nChairman:\nChief Executive:\n"},

Undertaken at manufacturing facilities, power plants, and large institutions such as hospitals and universities, it significantly increases efficiency, thereby reducing energy costs and  pollution simultaneously.  The process is noted for its potential to mitigate  profitably.  This work is usually done in the form of  (also called ) or .\nElectric Turbo Compounding (ETC) is a technology solution to the challenge of improving the fuel efficiency of gas and diesel engines by recovering waste energy from the exhaust gases.\n recovery is a process that captures excess heat that would normally be discharged at manufacturing facilities and converts it into electricity and steam, or returns energy to the manufacturing process in the form of heated air, water, glycol, or oil.\nA \"waste heat recovery boiler\" contains a series of water-filled tubes placed throughout the area where heat is released. When high-temperature heat meets the boiler, steam is produced, which in turn powers a turbine that creates electricity. This process is similar to that of other fired boilers, but in this case, waste heat replaces a traditional flame. No fossil fuels are used in this process. Metals, glass, pulp and paper, silicon and other production plants are typical locations where waste heat recovery can be effective.\n (CHP), also called , is, according to the , \u201can efficient, clean, and reliable approach to generating electricity and heat energy from a single fuel source. By installing a CHP system designed to meet the thermal and electrical base loads of a facility, CHP can greatly increase the facility's operational efficiency and decrease energy costs. At the same time, CHP reduces the emission of greenhouse gases, which contribute to global climate change.\u201d When electricity is produced on-site with a CHP plant, excess heat is recycled to produce both processed heat and additional power.\nWaste heat recovery from air conditioning is also used as an alternative to wasting heat to the atmosphere from chiller plants. Heat recovered in summer from chiller plants is stored in Thermalbanks in the ground and recycled back to the same building in winter via a heat pump to provide heating without burning fossil fuels. This elegant approach saves energy - and carbon - in both seasons by recycling summer heat for winter use.\n and  are classes of technologies that can enable the recycling of energy that would otherwise be inaccessible due to a temperature that is too low for utilization or a time lag between when the energy is available and when it is needed. While enhancing the temperature of available renewable thermal energy, heat pumps have the additional property of leveraging electrical power (or in some cases mechanical or thermal power) by using it to extract additional energy from a low quality source (such as seawater, lake water, the ground, the air, or waste heat from a process).\nThermal storage technologies allow heat or cold to be stored for periods of time ranging from hours or overnight to , and can involve storage of  (i.e. by changing the temperature of a medium) or  (i.e. through phase changes of a medium, such between water and slush or ice). Short-term thermal storages can be used for peak-shaving in district heating or electrical distribution systems. Kinds of renewable or alternative energy sources that can be enabled include natural energy (e.g. collected via solar-thermal collectors, or dry cooling towers used to collect winter's cold), waste energy (e.g. from HVAC equipment, industrial processes or power plants), or surplus energy (e.g. as seasonally from hydropower projects or intermittently from wind farms). The  (Alberta, Canada) is illustrative.  allows the community to get 97% of its year-round heat from solar collectors on the garage roofs, which most of the heat collected in summer. \nTypes of storages for sensible energy include insulated tanks, borehole clusters in substrates ranging from gravel to bedrock, deep aquifers, or shallow lined pits that are insulated on top. Some types of storage are capable of storing heat or cold  (particularly if very large), and some storage applications require inclusion of a . Latent heat is typically stored in ice tanks or what are called  (PCMs).\nBoth waste heat recovery and CHP constitute \"decentralized\" energy production, which is in contrast to traditional \"centralized\" power generated at large power plants run by regional utilities.  The \u201ccentralized\u201d system has an average efficiency of 34 percent, requiring about three units of fuel to produce one unit of power.  By capturing both heat and power, CHP and waste heat recovery projects have higher efficiencies.\nA 2007 Department of Energy study found the potential for 135,000 megawatts of CHP in the U.S., and a Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory study identified about 64,000 megawatts that could be obtained from industrial waste energy, not counting CHP.  These studies suggest about 200,000 megawatts\u2014or 20% -- of total power capacity that could come from energy recycling in the U.S.  Widespread use of energy recycling could therefore reduce global warming emissions by an estimated 20 percent.  Indeed, as of 2005, about 42 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas pollution came from the production of electricity and 27 percent from the production of heat.\nAdvocates contend that recycled energy costs less and has lower emissions than most other energy options in current use.\nCurrently RecyclingEnergy Int. Corp. takes advantage of recycling energy in  and latent heat pump and CHCP.\nPerhaps the first modern use of energy recycling was done by .  His 1882 Pearl Street Station, the world\u2019s first commercial power plant, was a CHP plant, producing both electricity and thermal energy while using waste heat to warm neighboring buildings. Recycling allowed Edison\u2019s plant to achieve approximately 50 percent efficiency.\nBy the early 1900s, regulations emerged to promote rural electrification through the construction of centralized plants managed by regional utilities.  These regulations not only promoted electrification throughout the countryside, but they also discouraged decentralized power generation, such as CHP.  They even went so far as to make it illegal for non-utilities to sell power.\nBy 1978, Congress recognized that efficiency at central power plants had stagnated and sought to encourage improved efficiency with the  (PURPA), which encouraged utilities to buy power from other energy producers. CHP plants proliferated, soon producing about 8 percent of all energy in the U.S.  However, the bill left implementation and enforcement up to individual states, resulting in little or nothing being done in many parts of the country.\nIn 2008 , chairman of , said that \"\"\nOutside the U.S., energy recycling is more common. Denmark is probably the most active energy recycler, obtaining about 55% of its energy from CHP and waste heat recovery. Other large countries, including Germany, Russia, and India, also obtain a much higher share of their energy from decentralized sources.\n"},

Climate projections indicate that the ozone layer will return to 1980 levels between 2050 and 2070.  Due to its widespread adoption and implementation it has been hailed as an example of exceptional international co-operation, with  quoted as saying that \"perhaps the single most successful international agreement to date has been the Montreal Protocol\". In comparison, effective burden sharing and solution proposals mitigating regional conflicts of interest have been among the success factors for the  challenge, where global regulation based on the  has  failed to do so. In this case of the ozone depletion challenge, there was global regulation already being installed before a scientific consensus was established. Also, overall public opinion was convinced of possible imminent risks.\nThe two ozone treaties have been ratified by 197 parties (196 states and the ), making them the  in United Nations history.\nThese truly universal treaties have also been remarkable in the expedience of the policy-making process at the global scale, where only 14 years lapsed between a basic scientific research discovery (1973) and the international agreement signed (1985 and 1987).\nThe treaty is structured around several groups of  that deplete stratospheric ozone.

The phasing-out of the less damaging  only began in 1996 and will go on until a complete phasing-out is achieved by 2030.\nThere were a few exceptions for \"essential uses\" where no acceptable substitutes were initially found (for example, in the past metered dose inhalers commonly used to treat asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were exempt) or  fire suppression systems used in submarines and aircraft (but not in general industry).\nThe substances in Group I of Annex A are:\nThe provisions of the Protocol include the requirement that the Parties to the Protocol base their future decisions on the current scientific, environmental, technical, and economic information that is assessed through panels drawn from the worldwide expert communities. To provide that input to the decision-making process, advances in understanding on these topics were assessed in 1989, 1991, 1994, 1998 and 2002 in a series of reports entitled , by the Scientific Assessment Panel (SAP).\nIn 1990 a Technology and Economic Assessment Panel was also established as the technology and economics advisory body to the Montreal Protocol Parties. The Technology and Economic Assessment Panel (TEAP) provides, at the request of Parties, technical information related to the alternative technologies that have been investigated and employed to make it possible to virtually eliminate use of Ozone Depleting Substances (such as CFCs and Halons), that harm the ozone layer. The TEAP is also tasked by the Parties every year to assess and evaluate various technical issues including evaluating nominations for essential use exemptions for CFCs and halons, and nominations for critical use exemptions for methyl bromide. TEAP's annual reports are a basis for the Parties\u2019 informed decision-making.\nNumerous reports have been published by various inter-governmental, governmental and non-governmental organizations to catalogue and assess alternatives to the ozone depleting substances, since the substances have been used in various technical sectors, like in refrigeration, air conditioning, flexible and rigid foam, fire protection, aerospace, electronics, agriculture, and laboratory measurements.\nUnder the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, especially Executive Committee (ExCom) 53/37 and ExCom 54/39, Parties to this Protocol agreed to set year 2013 as the time to freeze the consumption and production of HCFCs for developing countries. For developed countries, reduction of HCFC consumption and production began in 2004 and 2010, respectively, with 100% reduction set for 2020.  Developing countries agreed to start reducing its consumption and production of HCFCs by 2015, with 100% reduction set for 2030.\nHydrochlorofluorocarbons, commonly known as HCFCs, are a group of man-made compounds containing hydrogen, chlorine, fluorine and carbon. They are not found anywhere in nature. HCFC production began to take off after countries agreed to phase out the use of CFCs in the 1980s, which were found to be destroying the ozone layer. Like CFCs, HCFCs are used for refrigeration, aerosol propellants, foam manufacture and air conditioning. Unlike the CFCs, however, most HCFCs are broken down in the lowest part of the atmosphere and pose a much smaller risk to the ozone layer. Nevertheless, HCFCs are very potent , despite their very low atmospheric concentrations, measured in parts per trillion (million million).\nThe HCFCs are transitional CFCs replacements, used as , solvents, blowing agents for plastic foam manufacture, and fire extinguishers. In terms of  (ODP), in comparison to CFCs that have ODP 0.6 \u2013 1.0, these HCFCs have lower ODPs (0.01 \u2013 0.5). In terms of  (GWP), in comparison to CFCs that have GWP 4,680 \u2013 10,720, HCFCs have lower GWPs (76 \u2013 2,270).\nOn January 1, 2019 the  to the Montreal Protocol came into force. Under the Kigali Amendment countries promised to reduce the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) by more than 80% over the next 30 years. By December 27, 2018, 65 countries had ratified the Amendment.\nProduced mostly in developed countries,  (HFCs) replaced CFCs and HCFCs. HFCs pose no harm to the ozone layer because, unlike CFCs and HCFCs, they do not contain chlorine. They are, however, greenhouse gases, with a high global warming potential (GWP), comparable to that of CFCs and HCFCs. In 2009, a study calculated that a fast phasedown of high-GWP HFCs could potentially prevent the equivalent of up to 8.8 Gt CO2-eq  in emissions by 2050. A proposed phasedown of HFCs was hence projected to avoid up to 0.5C of warming by 2100 under the high-HFC growth scenario, and up to 0.35C under the low-HFC growth scenario. Recognizing the opportunity presented for fast and effective phasing down of HFCs through the Montreal Protocol, starting in 2009 the  proposed an amendment to phase down high-GWP HFCs, with the U.S., Canada, and Mexico following with a similar proposal in 2010.\nAfter seven years of negotiations, in October 2016 at the 28th Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol in , the Parties to the Montreal Protocol adopted the Kigali Amendment whereby the Parties agreed to phase down HFCs under the Montreal Protocol. The amendment to the legally-binding Montreal Protocol will ensure that industrialised countries bring down their HFC production and consumption by at least 85 per cent compared to their annual average values in the period 2011\u20132013. A group of developing countries including China, Brazil and South Africa are mandated to reduce their HFC use by 85 per cent of their average value in 2020-22 by the year 2045. India and some other developing countries \u2014 Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, and some oil economies like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait \u2014 will cut down their HFCs by 85 per cent of their values in 2024-26 by the year 2047.\nOn 17 November 2017, ahead of the 29th Meeting of the Parties of the Montreal Protocol, Sweden became the 20th Party to ratify the Kigali Amendment, pushing the Amendment over its ratification threshold ensuring that the Amendment would enter into force 1 January 2019.\nIn 1973, the chemists  and , who were then at the , began studying the impacts of CFCs in the Earth's atmosphere. They discovered that CFC molecules were stable enough to remain in the atmosphere until they got up into the middle of the  where they would finally (after an average of 50\u2013100 years for two common CFCs) be broken down by  releasing a  atom. Rowland and Molina then proposed that these chlorine atoms might be expected to cause the breakdown of large amounts of ozone (O) in the stratosphere. Their argument was based upon an analogy to contemporary work by  and Harold Johnston, which had shown that nitric oxide (NO) could catalyze the destruction of ozone. (Several other scientists, including , Richard Stolarski, Michael McElroy, and Steven Wofsy had independently proposed that chlorine could catalyze ozone loss, but none had realized that CFCs were a potentially large source of chlorine.) Crutzen, Molina and Rowland were awarded the 1995  for their work on this problem.\nThe environmental consequence of this discovery was that, since stratospheric ozone absorbs most of the ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation reaching the surface of the planet, depletion of the ozone layer by CFCs would lead to an increase in UV-B radiation at the surface, resulting in an increase in skin cancer and other impacts such as damage to crops and to marine phytoplankton.\nBut the Rowland-Molina hypothesis was strongly disputed by representatives of the aerosol and halocarbon industries. The chair of the board of  was quoted as saying that ozone depletion theory is \"a science fiction tale...a load of rubbish...utter nonsense\". , the president of Precision Valve Corporation (and inventor of the first practical aerosol spray can valve), wrote to the Chancellor of UC Irvine to complain about Rowland's public statements (Roan, p.\u00a056.)\nAfter publishing their pivotal paper in June 1974, Rowland and Molina testified at a\nhearing before the U.S. House of Representatives in December 1974. As a result, significant funding was made available to study various aspects of the problem and to confirm the initial findings. In 1976, the U.S.  (NAS) released a report that confirmed the scientific credibility of the ozone depletion hypothesis. NAS continued to publish assessments of related science for the next decade.\nThen, in 1985,  scientists ,  and  published results of abnormally low ozone concentrations above  near the . They speculated that this was connected to increased levels of CFCs in the atmosphere. It took several other attempts to establish the Antarctic losses as real and significant, especially after NASA had retrieved matching data from its satellite recordings. The impact of these studies, the metaphor 'ozone hole', and the colourful visual representation in a time lapse animation proved shocking enough for negotiators in Montreal, Canada to take the issue seriously.\nAlso in 1985, 20 nations, including most of the major CFC producers, signed the , which established a framework for negotiating international regulations on ozone-depleting substances. After the discovery of the ozone hole \nby SAGE 2 it only took 18 months to reach a binding agreement in Montreal, Canada.\nBut the CFC industry did not give up that easily. As late as 1986, the Alliance for Responsible CFC Policy (an association representing the CFC industry founded by ) was still arguing that the science was too uncertain to justify any action. In 1987, DuPont testified before the US Congress that \"We believe there is no imminent crisis that demands unilateral regulation.\" And even in March 1988, Du Pont Chair Richard E. Heckert would write in a letter to the United States Senate, \"we will not produce a product unless it can be made, used, handled and disposed of safely and consistent with appropriate safety, health and environmental quality criteria. At the moment, scientific evidence does not point to the need for dramatic CFC emission reductions. There is no available measure of the contribution of CFCs to any observed ozone change...\"\nThe main objective of the  is to assist developing country parties to the Montreal Protocol whose annual per capita consumption and production of ozone depleting substances (ODS) is less than 0.3\u00a0kg to comply with the control measures of the Protocol. Currently, 147 of the 196 Parties to the Montreal Protocol meet these criteria (they are referred to as Article 5 countries).\nIt embodies the principle agreed at the  in 1992 that countries have a common but differentiated responsibility to protect and manage the global commons.\nThe Fund is managed by an Executive Committee with an equal representation of seven industrialized and seven Article 5 countries, which are elected annually by a Meeting of the Parties. The Committee reports annually to the Meeting of the Parties on its operations. The work of the Multilateral Fund on the ground in developing countries is carried out by four Implementing Agencies, which have contractual agreements with the Executive Committee:\nUp to 20 percent of the contributions of contributing parties can also be delivered through their bilateral agencies in the form of eligible projects and activities.\nThe fund is replenished on a three-year basis by the donors. Pledges amount to US$3.1 billion over the period 1991 to 2005. Funds are used, for example, to finance the conversion of existing manufacturing processes, train personnel, pay royalties and patent rights on new technologies, and establish national ozone offices.\nAs of 23 June 2015, all countries in the United Nations, the , ,  as well as the  have ratified the original Montreal Protocol (see external link below), with  being the last country to ratify the agreement, bringing the total to 197. These countries have also ratified the London, Copenhagen, Montreal, and Beijing amendments.\nSince the Montreal Protocol came into effect, the atmospheric concentrations of the most important chlorofluorocarbons and related chlorinated hydrocarbons have either leveled off or decreased. Halon concentrations have continued to increase, as the halons presently stored in fire extinguishers are released, but their rate of increase has slowed and their abundances are expected to begin to decline by about 2020. Also, the concentration of the HCFCs increased drastically at least partly because of many uses (e.g. used as solvents or refrigerating agents) CFCs were substituted with HCFCs. While there have been reports of attempts by individuals to circumvent the ban, e.g. by smuggling CFCs from undeveloped to developed nations, the overall level of compliance has been high. Statistical analysis from 2010 show a clear positive signal from the Montreal Protocol to the stratospheric ozone. In consequence, the Montreal Protocol has often been called the most successful international environmental agreement to date. In a 2001 report, NASA found the ozone thinning over Antarctica had remained the same thickness for the previous three years, however in 2003 the ozone hole grew to its second largest size. The most recent (2006) scientific evaluation of the effects of the Montreal Protocol states, \"The Montreal Protocol is working: There is clear evidence of a decrease in the atmospheric burden of ozone-depleting substances and some early signs of stratospheric ozone recovery.\" However, a more recent study seems to point to a relative increase in CFCs due to an unknown source.\nReported in 1997, significant production of CFCs occurred in Russia for sale on the black market to the EU throughout the 90s. Related US production and consumption was enabled by fraudulent reporting due to poor enforcement mechanisms. Similar illegal markets for CFCs were detected in Taiwan, Korea, and Hong Kong.\nThe Montreal Protocol is also expected to have effects on human health. A 2015 report by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that the protection of the ozone layer under the treaty will prevent over 280 million cases of skin cancer, 1.5 million skin cancer deaths, and 45 million cataracts in the United States.\nHowever, the hydrochlorofluorocarbons, or HCFCs, and hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, are now thought to contribute to . On a molecule-for-molecule basis, these compounds are up to 10,000 times more potent greenhouse gases than carbon dioxide. The Montreal Protocol currently calls for a complete phase-out of HCFCs by 2030, but does not place any restriction on HFCs. Since the CFCs themselves are equally powerful greenhouse gases, the mere substitution of HFCs for CFCs does not significantly increase the rate of anthropogenic climate change, but over time a steady increase in their use could increase the danger that human activity will change the climate.\nPolicy experts have advocated for increased efforts to link ozone protection efforts to climate protection efforts. Policy decisions in one arena affect the costs and effectiveness of environmental improvements in the other.\nIn 2018, scientists monitoring the atmosphere following the 2010 phaseout date have reported evidence of continuing industrial production of CFC-11, likely in eastern Asia, with detrimental global effects on the ozone layer.  A monitoring study detected fresh atmospheric releases of carbon tetrachloride from China's  province, beginning sometime after 2012, and accounting for a large part of emissions exceeding global estimates under the Montreal Protocol.\nThe year 2012 marked the 25th anniversary of the signing of the Montreal Protocol. Accordingly, the Montreal Protocol community organized a range of celebrations at the national, regional and international levels to publicize its considerable success to date and to consider the work ahead for the future.\nAmong its accomplishments are: The Montreal Protocol was the first international treaty to address a global environmental regulatory challenge; the first to embrace the \"precautionary principle\" in its design for science-based policymaking; the first treaty where independent experts on atmospheric science, environmental impacts, chemical technology, and economics, reported directly to Parties, without edit or censorship, functioning under norms of professionalism, peer review, and respect; the first to provide for national differences in responsibility and financial capacity to respond by establishing a multilateral fund for technology transfer; the first MEA with stringent reporting, trade, and binding chemical phase-out obligations for both developed and developing countries; and, the first treaty with a financial mechanism managed democratically by an Executive Board with equal representation by developed and developing countries.\nWithin 25 years of signing, parties to the MP celebrate significant milestones. Significantly, the world has phased-out 98% of the Ozone-Depleting Substances (ODS) contained in nearly 100 hazardous chemicals worldwide; every country is in compliance with stringent obligations; and, the MP has achieved the status of the first global regime with universal ratification; even the newest member state, South Sudan, ratified in 2013. UNEP received accolades for achieving global consensus that \"demonstrates the world\u2019s commitment to ozone protection, and more broadly, to global environmental protection\".\n\u00a0This article incorporates\u00a0 from the  document: \n"},

Its main role is to protect and improve Scotland's environment.  SEPA does this by helping business and industry to understand their environmental responsibilities, enabling customers to comply with legislation and good practice and to realise the economic benefits of good environmental practice. One of the ways SEPA does this is through the  environmental guidance service.  It protects communities by regulating activities that can cause harmful pollution and by monitoring the quality of Scotland's air, land and water.  The regulations it implements also cover the storage, transport and disposal of radioactive materials.\nSEPA is an  (Executive NDPB, often known as a ) of the . SEPA was established in 1996 by the  and is responsible for the protection of the  in Scotland. SEPA is a member of .\nSEPA\u2019s  is to be an environmental regulator and an effective and influential authority on the environment.\nSEPA provides a system of  for  that aims to improve the environment and help deliver the \u2019s overall environmental objectives.\nSo that it can effectively achieve its mission and aims, SEPA has created a Corporate Plan which lists its priorities and goals.\nSEPA employs around 1,300 staff who are involved in protecting Scotland's environment and human health. SEPA\u2019s staff are employed in a wide range of specialist areas which include: , , environmental regulation, , , , planning, , business support and management functions.\nThe agency operates through three directorates:\nThe previously named Environmental Protection and Improvement (EPI) Directorate is now known as Operations after an internal reorganisation in April 2010. The directorate includes environmental policy, radioactive substances policy and regulation, SEPA\u2019s advisory work, river basin management planning, national planning, strategic environmental assessment and Organisational Development (encompassing Human Resources, Health and Safety and Learning and Development).\nThe Environmental and Organisational Strategy Directorate and Environmental Science Directorate were merged in a reorganisation that took place in April 2010. The directorate is now known as Science and Strategy Directorate and includes , , Marine, , Environmental Quality, Radioactive Substances, Science, Organisational Planning and Improvement, Environmental Strategy.  is also part of this directorate, because of its strategic role within the organisation.\nThe Finance and Corporate Services directorate undertakes the financial planning and reporting for the organisation as well as its procurement, facilities management, information systems and management and resilience activities.\nThe Agency Board legally constitutes SEPA and board members are appointed by Scottish Ministers. SEPA\u2019s Chairman and a Deputy Chairman are appointed by Scottish Ministers and the Agency Board appoints a Chief Executive.\nSEPA used to have Regional Boards (North, South-west and South-east) that undertook local engagement with customers, partners and stakeholders. However, these were phased out by 2010 and SEPA now adopts a different approach to engage with its stakeholders at a local level.\nSEPA is Scotland\u2019s national flood forecasting, flood warning and strategic flood risk management authority.\nSEPA operates Scotland's flood warning service. This is a 24-hour, 7-day-a-week, information service which includes direct warnings by phone and online flood warnings and flooding updates through its dedicated telephone number 0345 988 1188.\nAs the name suggests, the  service is designed to give the public early warning of likely flooding in specific areas. The service also gives advice on what to do before, during and after a flood.\nIn Wales, Floodline is operated by Natural Resources Wales, and in England by the \nIn March 2011 SEPA enhanced its provision with a direct warnings extension to its Floodline service. This sends flood warning information for a chosen geographical area direct to customers who have registered a mobile or landline telephone number.\nAlso, that month the  (SFFS) was formed, a partnership between SEPA and the  with \u00a3750,000 of funding from the . Its role is to provide flooding forecasts to Category 1 & 2 responders.\nIn order to protect Scotland's air quality, SEPA regulates and monitors industrial activities and processes in Scotland that may lead to local airborne pollution. In order to do this effectively, SEPA works closely with local authorities and other partners to manage and improve air quality locally.\"\nThere are many things which can negatively affect good air quality such as, vehicle and transport emissions, energy production, some industrial processes, waste and agriculture. The  that are produced by these activities can significantly damage air quality which can lead to health problems, depletion of the  and changes to other natural habitats.\nThe overall picture in Scotland is one of good air quality which has been getting better over the last 30 years or so, particularly in urban areas. But the picture is not perfect. There are some localised problems in Scottish towns, mainly caused by traffic emissions. ... Scotland\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions are contributing to global climate changes which are likely to have significant long term environmental impacts.\nAlasdair D. Paton, SEPA Chief Executive, 1999.\nSEPA and the Scottish Government work in partnership with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs () to ensure the objectives that are listed in the Air Quality Strategy for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are achieved.\nThe SAQ database and website were commissioned by the Scottish Government. Launched in April 2007, SAQD was set up to provide a single source of air quality information for Scotland that would improve research quality to support and evaluate Scotland\u2019s air quality policies whilst also providing the public with more easily understood and accessible local air quality information.\nSEPA's position on climate change recognises that it is the greatest threat to our physical and socio-economic future. The organisation has produced a climate change plan which contains details about how SEPA will reduce its own carbon emissions. This five year climate change plan introduces SEPA's specific role in climate change mitigation and what they will do over the next five years to further integrate climate change across the organisation.\nSEPA\u2019s Climate Change Plan was subject to a  (SEA) as part of its preparation.  This was required under the Environmental Assessment (Scotland) Act 2005. The SEA helped SEPA to understand the environmental effects of the plan and allowed for improvements to be made throughout the preparation process. The environmental report explains, in detail, the findings of the SEA. As the plan has now been formally adopted, SEPA is required to explain how it has taken account of the SEA process in a \"SEA Statement\".\nSEPA,  (SNH),  (FLS) and  are all government funded organisations with responsibilities for different aspects of Scotland\u2019s environment and heritage; in 2009 a joint statement on climate change was prepared as part of a joint approach in Scotland.\n\"The Scientific evidence is now overwhelming: climate change presents very serious global risks and it demands an urgent global response\".\nIn Scotland, the effects of climate change can be seen in raised  changes, increased rainfall and less snow cover (than the last Ice Age). These changes have a significant impact on the growing, breeding and migration seasons, as well as species abundance and diversity.\nSEPA aims to protect and enhance the quality of Scotland\u2019s land through provision of guidance on good land use practice and a variety of regulatory measures.\nSEPA is identified as a key agency under the  and help deliver the 's commitment in providing a more effective and efficient planning system. SEPA also provide formal environmental advice in relation to development plans and on various development proposals across Scotland.\nSEPA attempts to enable good development whilst also and protecting Scotland's environment through the planning system and takes a consultative approach where they can add most value. The agency tends to favour early engagement with planning authorities to ensure they can support development plan proposals and aid the implementation of a genuinely plan-led land use planning system.\nThere exists a guidance note \"How and when to consult SEPA\" that provides further information on planning consultation with SEPA.\nRadioactive substances are used widely in industry, medicine and research in Scotland. Uses can range greatly from the diagnosis and treatment of diseases to its use in energy generation and nuclear weapons. However, if radioactive substances are not stored or used properly, they can potentially cause significant human health problems and damage to the environment.\nAs SEPA has a responsibility for protecting Scotland's environment and human health, it also has responsibility for regulating the storage, and use of, radioactive substances and the accumulation and disposal of radioactive wastes in Scotland, including functions under the . The State of Scotland's Environment 2006 Report showed a downward trend in levels of man-made radioactivity in the environment over the last decade.\nOne of the best ways to minimise the negative effects of waste are through  and prevention. However, waste can also be put to good use through reuse, recycling, composting and .\nAnother one of SEPA's statutory duties is to protect the environment and human health in Scotland from the effects of  and disposal. SEPA reports on waste data and is also involved in enforcing European compliance schemes. They also support the  and other organisations in delivering Scotland's National Waste Plan.\nScotland\u2019s water environments provide rich sources of drinking water, provide natural habitats, are a focus for leisure and recreation activities and are vital resources for many of Scotland's industries. SEPA helps protect and improve Scotland\u2019s water environment through regulation, monitoring and planning.\nAs mentioned above, SEPA is the flood warning authority for Scotland and they work with other organisations to manage flood risk. SEPA's  monitor these water levels so that they can warn the public and businesses of the likelihood of a flood.\nSEPA provides annual reports on the quality of Scotland\u2019s bathing waters. Complying with the European Community (EC) Bathing Water Directive, they also work closely with other organisations to reduce the risk of urban and rural pollution in Scotland's coastal and inland bathing waters.\nSEPA regulates other water activities such as discharges to groundwater, discharges to surface water, , removal of  and replacement of weirs.\nSEPA has a duty to monitor and report on the state of Scotland's environment. SEPA then uses that scientific understanding to better regulate the activities that may negatively affect environmental quality. SEPA publish a wide range of environmental information and advise Ministers, partner bodies, regulated industry and the public on environmental issues.\nSEPA employ experts in many fields of science, including , , , , , hydromorphology, , and . These scientists analyse samples collected from across Scotland's air, land and water environments for changes and degradation of the environment or threat to human health. SEPA tests individual chemical parameters and the levels of plants and animals in marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats. They also conduct analyses of solid waste arisings and audit check analyses of gaseous emissions to the atmosphere.\nIn 2009, SEPA was maintaining and operating a significant network of gauging stations and rain gauges to provide national flood warning and forecasting services for Scotland. SEPA holds over 30 years of hydrometric data for Scotland's rivers. These data are invaluable in characterising the long-term pressures on Scotland's environment, particularly in relation to the assessment and management of the consequences of .\nSEPA's testing, analysis and interpretation of samples covers a wide range of environments throughout Scotland, including contaminated land, fresh and saline waters, soils and sediments, sewage and industrial effluents, , fauna and biota, and .\nSEPA operates a formal quality assurance system for its monitoring and assessment functions. Their quality assurance system is compliant with international standards , , and , and is monitored and externally audited by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service ()  and .\nSEPA is an organisation which was established to protect and enhance Scotland\u2019s environment and protect human health. To do this, it is important that SEPA has a sound science and knowledge base. This information helps them to carry out their powers and duties and to inform the development of effective policy making.\nSEPA's mandate for research and development activity is required by founding legislation.\nOn 11 December 2008, SEPA launched their Research strategy 2008\u20132012 which defines their aims, needs and interests in research and development.\n"},

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_minimization", "title": "WasteminimisationWikipedia", "body": "\n is a set of processes and practices intended to reduce the amount of  produced.  By reducing or eliminating the generation of harmful and persistent wastes, waste minimisation supports efforts to promote a more  society. Waste minimisation involves redesigning products and processes and/or changing societal patterns of  and production.\nThe most environmentally resourceful, , and  way to manage waste often is to not have to address the problem in the first place. Managers see waste minimisation as a primary focus for most  strategies. Proper waste treatment and disposal can require a significant amount of time and resources; therefore, the benefits of waste minimisation can be considerable if carried out in an effective, safe and sustainable manner.\nTraditional waste management focuses on processing waste after it is created, concentrating on , ,  and  conversion. Waste minimisation involves efforts to avoid creating the waste during manufacturing.  To effectively implement waste minimisation the manager requires knowledge of the production process,  (the tracking of materials from their extraction to their return to earth) and details of the composition of the waste.\nThe main sources of waste . In the , most waste comes from the construction and  of buildings, followed by  and quarrying, industry and commerce. Household waste constitutes a relatively small proportion of all waste.  Industrial waste is often tied to requirements in the .  For example, a company handling a product may insist that it should be shipped using particular packing because it fits downstream needs.\nWaste minimisation can  and often turns out to have positive economic benefits.  Waste minimisation can improve:\nIn , using more efficient manufacturing processes and better materials generally reduces the production of waste. The application of waste minimisation techniques has led to the development of innovative and commercially successful replacement products.\nWaste minimisation efforts often require investment, which is usually compensated by the savings. However, waste reduction in one part of the production process may create waste production in another part.\nWaste minimisation and resource maximisation for  can most easily be done at the design stage. Reducing the number of  used in a product or making the product easier to take apart can make it easier to be repaired or recycled at the end of its useful life.\nIn some cases, it may be best not to minimise the volume of  used to make a product, but instead reduce the volume or  of the waste created at the end of a product's life, or the environmental impact of the product's use.  (See section ).\nIn this strategy, products and  are optimally designed to meet their intended use.  This applies especially to , which should only be as durable as necessary to serve their intended purpose. On the other hand, it could be more wasteful if food, which has consumed resources and energy in its production, is damaged and spoiled because of extreme measures to reduce the use of , ,  and  in its packaging.\nImproving , such as extending a 's useful life to 15 years instead of 12, can reduce waste and usually much improves resource optimisation.\nBut in some cases it has a negative .  If a product is too durable, its replacement with more efficient technology is likely to be delayed. Therefore, extending an older machine's useful life may place a heavier burden on the environment than scrapping it, recycling its metal and buying a new model.  Similarly, older vehicles consume more fuel and produce more emissions than their modern counterparts.\nMost proponents of waste minimisation consider that the way forward may be to view any manufactured product at the end of its useful life as a resource for recycling and reuse rather than waste.\nMaking refillable glass  strong enough to withstand several journeys between the  and the  requires making them thicker and so heavier, which increases the resources required to transport them. Since transport has a large environmental impact, careful evaluation is required of the number of return journeys bottles make.  If a refillable bottle is thrown away after being refilled only several times, the resources wasted may be greater than if the bottle had been designed for a single journey..\nMany choices involve trade-offs of environmental impact, and often there is insufficient information to make informed decisions.\nVarious aspects of business practices affect waste, such as the use of  in restaurants.\n are a visible form of re-use, and some stores offer a \"bag credit\" for re-usable shopping bags, although at least  reversed its policy, claiming \"it was just a temporary bonus\".  In contrast, one study suggests that a bag tax is a more effective incentive than a similar discount.  (Of note, the before/after study compared a circumstance in which some stores offered a discount vs. a circumstance in which all stores applying the tax.)  While there is a minor inconvenience involved, this may remedy itself, as reusable bags are generally more convenient for carrying groceries.\nThis section details some waste minimisation techniques for .\nAppropriate amounts and sizes can be chosen when purchasing goods; buying large containers of paint for a small decorating job or buying larger amounts of food than can be consumed create unnecessary waste. Also, if a pack or  is to be thrown away, any remaining contents must be removed before the container can be recycled.\nHome , the practice of turning kitchen and garden waste into compost can be considered waste minimisation.\nThe resources that households use can be reduced considerably by  thoughtfully (e.g. turning off lights and equipment when it is not needed) and by reducing the number of car journeys made. Individuals can reduce the amount of waste they create by buying fewer products and by buying products which last longer. Mending broken or worn items of clothing or equipment also contributes to minimising household waste. Individuals can minimise their water usage, and walk or cycle to their destination rather than using their car to save fuel and cut down emissions.\nIn a domestic situation, the potential for minimisation is often dictated by .  Some people may view it as wasteful to purchase new products solely to follow  when the older products are still usable.  Adults working full-time have little free time, and so may have to purchase more  that require little preparation, or prefer disposable nappies if there is a baby in the family.\nThe amount of waste an individual produces is a small portion of all waste produced by society, and personal waste reduction can only make a small impact on overall waste volumes.  Yet, influence on policy can be exerted in other areas. Increased consumer awareness of the impact and power of certain purchasing decisions allows industry and individuals to change the total .  Consumers can influence manufacturers and distributors by avoiding buying products that do not have , which is currently not mandatory, or choosing products that minimise the use of packaging. In the ,  combines both  and  packaging , in a  packaging  classification system to minimise waste. Where reuse schemes are available, consumers can be proactive and use them.\n establishments are massive producers of waste. The major sources of healthcare waste are:  hospitals, laboratories and research centres, mortuary and autopsy centres, animal research and testing laboratories, blood banks and collection services, and nursing homes for the elderly.\nWaste minimisation can offer many opportunities to these establishments to use fewer resources, be less wasteful and generate less hazardous waste.  Good management and control practices among health-care facilities can have a significant effect on the reduction of waste generated each day.\nThere are many examples of more efficient practices that can encourage waste minimization in healthcare establishments and research facilities\n\n\n\n"},
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol", "title": "KyotoProtocolWikipedia", "body": "\nThe  is an international  which extends the 1992  (UNFCCC) that commits state parties to reduce  emissions, based on the  that (part one)  is occurring and (part two) it is extremely likely that human-made  have predominantly caused it. The Kyoto Protocol was adopted in , , on 11 December 1997 and entered into force on 16 February 2005. There are currently 192 parties ( withdrew from the protocol, effective December 2012) to the Protocol.\nThe Kyoto Protocol implemented the objective of the UNFCCC to reduce the onset of global warming by reducing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere to \"a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system\" (Article 2). The Kyoto Protocol applies to the six greenhouse gases listed in Annex A: , , , Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), Perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and .\nThe Protocol is based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities: it acknowledges that individual countries have different capabilities in combating climate change, owing to , and therefore puts the obligation to reduce current emissions on developed countries on the basis that they are historically responsible for the current levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\nThe Protocol's first commitment period started in 2008 and ended in 2012. All 36 countries that fully participated in the first commitment period complied with the Protocol. However, nine countries had to resort to the flexibility mechanisms by funding emission reductions in other countries because their national emissions were slightly greater than their targets. The  helped reduce the emissions. The greatest emission reductions were seen in the former  countries because the  reduced their emissions in the early 1990s. Even though the 36 developed countries reduced their emissions, the global emissions increased by 32% from 1990 to 2010.\nA second commitment period was agreed in 2012, known as the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol, in which 37 countries have binding targets: , the  (and its 28 ), , , , , , , and . Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine have stated that they may withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol or not put into legal force the Amendment with second round targets. Japan, , and  have participated in Kyoto's first-round but have not taken on new targets in the second commitment period. Other developed countries without second-round targets are Canada (which withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol in 2012) and the  (which has not ratified). As of February 2020, 137 states have accepted the Doha Amendment, while entry into force requires the acceptances of 144 states. Of the 37 parties with binding commitments, 34 have ratified.\nNegotiations were held in the framework of the yearly UNFCCC Climate Change Conferences on measures to be taken after the second commitment period ends in 2020. This resulted in the 2015 adoption of the , which is a separate instrument under the UNFCCC rather than an amendment of the Kyoto Protocol.\nThe view that human activities are likely responsible for most of the observed increase in global mean temperature (\"global warming\") since the mid-20th century is an accurate reflection of current scientific thinking. Human-induced warming of the climate is expected to continue throughout the 21st century and beyond.\nThe  (IPCC, 2007) have produced a range of projections of what the future increase in global mean temperature might be. The IPCC's projections are , meaning that they assume no future efforts are made to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The IPCC projections cover the time period from the beginning of the 21st century to the end of the 21st century. The \"likely\" range (as assessed to have a greater than 66% probability of being correct, based on the IPCC's expert judgment) is a projected increase in global mean temperature over the 21st century of between 1.1 and 6.4\u00a0\u00b0C.\nThe range in temperature projections partly reflects different projections of future greenhouse gas emissions. Different projections contain different assumptions of future social and economic development (, , ), which in turn affects projections of future greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The range also reflects uncertainty in the response of the climate system to past and future GHG emissions (measured by the ).\n \u2013 The UN Conference on the Environment and Development is held in Rio de Janeiro. It results in the Framework Convention on Climate Change  among other agreements.\n \u2013 Parties to the UNFCCC meet in Berlin (the 1st Conference of Parties (COP) to the UNFCCC) to outline specific targets on emissions.\n \u2013 In December the parties conclude the Kyoto Protocol in Kyoto, Japan, in which they agree to the broad outlines of emissions targets.\n \u2013 Russia and Canada ratify the Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC bringing the treaty into effect on 16 February 2005.\n \u2013 Canada became the first signatory to announce its withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol.\n \u2013 On 31 December 2012, the first commitment period under the Protocol expired.\nMost countries are Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Article 2 of the Convention states its ultimate objective, which is to stabilize the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere \"at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic (human) interference with the climate system.\"\nThe ,  and  can provide information on decisions relating to this objective including the possible magnitude and rate of future climate changes. However, the IPCC has also concluded that the decision of what constitutes \"dangerous\" interference requires value judgements, which will vary between different regions of the world. Factors that might affect this decision include the local consequences of climate change impacts, the ability of a particular region to  (adaptive capacity), and the ability of a region to  (mitigative capacity).\nThe main goal of the Kyoto Protocol is to control emissions of the main anthropogenic (human-emitted) greenhouse gases (GHGs) in ways that reflect underlying national differences in GHG emissions, wealth, and capacity to make the reductions. The treaty follows the main principles agreed in the original 1992 UN Framework Convention. According to the treaty, in 2012, Annex I Parties who have ratified the treaty must have fulfilled their obligations of greenhouse gas emissions limitations established for the Kyoto Protocol's first commitment period (2008\u20132012). These emissions limitation commitments are listed in Annex B of the Protocol.\nThe Kyoto Protocol's first round commitments are the first detailed step taken within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Protocol establishes a structure of rolling emission reduction commitment periods. It set a timetable starting in 2006 for negotiations to establish emission reduction commitments for a second commitment period. The first period emission reduction commitments expired on 31 December 2012.\nThe ultimate objective of the UNFCCC is the \"stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would stop dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.\" Even if Annex I Parties succeed in meeting their first-round commitments, much greater emission reductions will be required in future to stabilize atmospheric GHG concentrations.\nFor each of the different anthropogenic GHGs, different levels of emissions reductions would be required to meet the objective of stabilizing atmospheric concentrations (see ).  () is the most important anthropogenic GHG. Stabilizing the concentration of  in the atmosphere would ultimately require the effective elimination of anthropogenic  emissions.\nSome of the principal concepts of the Kyoto Protocol are:\nUnder the Kyoto Protocol, 37  and the  (the -15, made up of 15 states at the time of the Kyoto negotiations) commit themselves to binding targets for GHG emissions. The targets apply to the four greenhouse gases  (),  (),  (),  (), and two groups of gases,  (HFCs) and  (PFCs). The six GHG are translated into  in determining reductions in emissions. These reduction targets are in addition to the industrial gases, chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, which are dealt with under the 1987 .\nUnder the Protocol, only the Annex I Parties have committed themselves to national or joint reduction targets (formally called \"quantified emission limitation and reduction objectives\" (QELRO) \u2013 Article 4.1). Parties to the Kyoto Protocol not listed in Annex I of the Convention (the non-Annex I Parties) are mostly low-income developing countries, and may participate in the Kyoto Protocol through the Clean Development Mechanism (explained below).\nThe emissions limitations of Annex I Parties varies between different Parties. Some Parties have emissions limitations reduce below the base year level, some have limitations at the base year level (no permitted increase above the base year level), while others have limitations above the base year level.\nEmission limits do not include emissions by international aviation and shipping. Although Belarus and Turkey are listed in the Convention's Annex I, they do not have emissions targets as they were not Annex I Parties when the Protocol was adopted. Kazakhstan does not have a target, but has declared that it wishes to become an Annex I Party to the Convention.\n \u2013 108% (2.1% of 1990 emissions) \n \u2013  87% \n \u2013 95% (subject to acceptance by other parties)\n \u2013 92.5% \n \u2013 92% (0.6%) \n \u2013 94% (3.33%) (withdrew) \n \u2013 95% () \n \u2013 92% (1.24%) \n \u2013 79% \n \u2013 92% (0.28%)\n \u2013 100% \n \u2013 100% \n \u2013 79% \n \u2013 125% \n \u2013 94% (0.52%) \n \u2013 110% (0.02%) \n \u2013 113% \n \u2013 93.5% \n \u2013 94% (8.55%) \n \u2013 92% (0.17%)\n \u2013 92% (0.0015%) \n \u2013 92% \n \u2013 72% \n \u2013 94% \n \u2013 100% (0.19%) \n \u2013 101% (0.26%) \n \u2013 94% (3.02%) \n \u2013 92% \n \u2013 92% (1.24%)\n \u2013 100% (17.4%) \n \u2013 92% (0.42%) \n \u2013 92% \n \u2013 115% \n \u2013 104% \n \u2013 92% (0.32%) \n \u2013 100% \n \u2013 87.5% \n \u2013 93% (36.1%) (non-party)\nFor most state parties, 1990 is the base year for the national GHG inventory and the calculation of the assigned amount. However, five state parties have an alternative base year:\nAnnex I Parties can use a range of sophisticated \"flexibility\" mechanisms (see below) to meet their targets. Annex I Parties can achieve their targets by allocating reduced annual allowances to major operators within their borders, or by allowing these operators to exceed their allocations by offsetting any excess through a mechanism that is agreed by all the parties to the UNFCCC, such as by buying  from other operators which have excess emissions credits.\nThe Protocol defines three \"\" that can be used by Annex I Parties in meeting their emission limitation commitments. The flexibility mechanisms are International Emissions Trading (IET), the  (CDM), and  (JI). IET allows Annex I Parties to \"trade\" their emissions (, AAUs, or \"allowances\" for short).\nThe economic basis for providing this flexibility is that the  cost of reducing (or abating) emissions differs among countries. \"Marginal cost\" is the cost of abating the last tonne of -eq for an Annex I/non-Annex I Party. At the time of the original Kyoto targets, studies suggested that the flexibility mechanisms could reduce the overall () cost of meeting the targets. Studies also showed that national losses in Annex I  (GDP) could be reduced by the use of the flexibility mechanisms.\nThe CDM and JI are called \"project-based mechanisms,\" in that they generate emission reductions from projects. The difference between IET and the project-based mechanisms is that IET is based on the setting of a quantitative restriction of emissions, while the CDM and JI are based on the idea of \"production\" of emission reductions. The CDM is designed to encourage production of emission reductions in non-Annex I Parties, while JI encourages production of emission reductions in Annex I Parties.\nThe production of emission reductions generated by the CDM and JI can be used by Annex I Parties in meeting their emission limitation commitments. The emission reductions produced by the CDM and JI are both measured against a hypothetical  of emissions that would have occurred in the absence of a particular emission reduction project. The emission reductions produced by the CDM are called  (CERs); reductions produced by JI are called  (ERUs). The reductions are called \"\" because they are emission reductions credited against a hypothetical baseline of emissions. \nOnly emission reduction projects that do not involve using nuclear energy are eligible for accreditation under the CDM, in order to prevent nuclear technology exports from becoming the default route for obtaining credits under the CDM.\nEach Annex I country is required to submit an annual report of inventories of all anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions from sources and removals from sinks under UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol. These countries nominate a person (called a \"designated national authority\") to create and manage its . Virtually all of the non-Annex I countries have also established a designated national authority to manage their Kyoto obligations, specifically the \"CDM process\". This determines which GHG projects they wish to propose for accreditation by the CDM Executive Board.\nA number of emissions trading schemes (ETS) have been, or are planned to be, implemented.\nThe design of the  (EU ETS) implicitly allows for trade of national Kyoto obligations to occur between participating countries (Carbon Trust, 2009, p.\u00a024). Carbon Trust (2009, pp.\u00a024\u201325) found that other than the trading that occurs as part of the EU ETS, no intergovernmental emissions trading had taken place.\nOne of the environmental problems with IET is the large surplus of allowances that are available. Russia, Ukraine, and the new EU-12 member states (the Kyoto Parties Annex I Economies-in-Transition, abbreviated \"IET\": Belarus, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Ukraine) have a surplus of allowances, while many  countries have a deficit. Some of the EITs with a surplus regard it as potential compensation for the trauma of their economic restructuring. When the Kyoto treaty was negotiated, it was recognized that emissions targets for the EITs might lead to them having an excess number of allowances. This excess of allowances were viewed by the EITs as \"headroom\" to grow their economies. The surplus has, however, also been referred to by some as \"hot air,\" a term which Russia (a country with an estimated surplus of 3.1 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent allowances) views as \"quite offensive.\"\nOECD countries with a deficit could meet their Kyoto commitments by buying allowances from transition countries with a surplus. Unless other commitments were made to reduce the total surplus in allowances, such trade would not actually result in emissions being reduced (see also the section below on the ).\nA Green Investment Scheme (GIS) refers to a plan for achieving environmental benefits from trading surplus allowances (AAUs) under the Kyoto Protocol. The Green Investment Scheme (GIS), a mechanism in the framework of International Emissions Trading (IET), is designed to achieve greater flexibility in reaching the targets of the Kyoto Protocol while preserving environmental integrity of IET. However, using the GIS is not required under the Kyoto Protocol, and there is no official definition of the term.\nUnder the GIS a Party to the Protocol expecting that the development of its economy will not exhaust its Kyoto quota, can sell the excess of its Kyoto quota units (AAUs) to another Party. The proceeds from the AAU sales should be \"greened\", i.e. channeled to the development and implementation of the projects either acquiring the greenhouse gases emission reductions (hard greening) or building up the necessary framework for this process (soft greening).\nLatvia was one of the front-runners of GISs. World Bank (2011) reported that Latvia has stopped offering AAU sales because of low AAU prices. In 2010, Estonia was the preferred source for AAU buyers, followed by the Czech Republic and Poland.\nJapan's national policy to meet their Kyoto target includes the purchase of AAUs sold under GISs. In 2010, Japan and Japanese firms were the main buyers of AAUs. In terms of the international carbon market, trade in AAUs are a small proportion of overall market value. In 2010, 97% of trade in the international carbon market was driven by the  (EU ETS). However, firms regulated under the EU ETS are unable to use AAUs in meeting their emissions caps.\nBetween 2001, which was the first year  (CDM) projects could be registered, and 2012, the end of the first Kyoto commitment period, the CDM is expected to produce some 1.5\u00a0billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (COe) in emission reductions. Most of these reductions are through , , and fuel switching (World Bank, 2010, p.\u00a0262). By 2012, the largest potential for production of CERs are estimated in  (52% of total CERs) and India (16%). CERs produced in Latin America and the Caribbean make up 15% of the potential total, with Brazil as the largest producer in the region (7%).\nThe formal crediting period for  (JI) was aligned with the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, and did not start until January 2008 (Carbon Trust, 2009, p.\u00a020). In November 2008, only 22 JI projects had been officially approved and registered. The total projected emission savings from JI by 2012 are about one tenth that of the CDM. Russia accounts for about two-thirds of these savings, with the remainder divided up roughly equally between the Ukraine and the EU's New Member States. Emission savings include cuts in methane, HFC, and NO emissions.\nAs noted , the first-round Kyoto emissions limitation commitments are not sufficient to stabilize the atmospheric concentration of GHGs. Stabilization of atmospheric GHG concentrations will require further emissions reductions after the end of the first-round Kyoto commitment period in 2012.\nAnalysts have developed  of future changes in GHG emissions that lead to a stabilization in the atmospheric concentrations of GHGs. Climate models suggest that lower stabilization levels are associated with lower magnitudes of future global warming, while higher stabilization levels are associated with higher magnitudes of future global warming (see figure opposite).\nTo achieve stabilization, global GHG emissions must peak, then decline. The lower the desired stabilization level, the sooner this peak and decline must occur (see figure opposite). For a given stabilization level, larger emissions reductions in the near term allow for less stringent emissions reductions later. On the other hand, less stringent near term emissions reductions would, for a given stabilization level, require more stringent emissions reductions later on.\nThe first period Kyoto emissions limitations can be viewed as a first-step towards achieving atmospheric stabilization of GHGs. In this sense, the first period Kyoto commitments may affect what future atmospheric stabilization level can be achieved.\nAt the  held in 2010, Parties to the UNFCCC agreed that future global warming should be limited  relative to the pre-industrial temperature level. One of the stabilization levels discussed in relation to this temperature target is to hold atmospheric concentrations of GHGs at 450  (ppm) - eq. Stabilization at 450\u00a0ppm could be associated with a 26 to 78% risk of exceeding the 2\u00a0\u00b0C target.\nScenarios assessed by Gupta  (2007) suggest that Annex I emissions would need to be 25% to 40% below 1990 levels by 2020, and 80% to 95% below 1990 levels by 2050. The only Annex I Parties to have made voluntary pledges in line with this are Japan (25% below 1990 levels by 2020) and Norway (30\u201340% below 1990 levels by 2020).\nGupta  (2007) also looked at what 450\u00a0ppm scenarios projected for non-Annex I Parties. Projections indicated that by 2020, non-Annex I emissions in several regions (, the , , and  ) would need to be substantially reduced below . \"Business-as-usual\" are projected non-Annex I emissions in the absence of any new policies to control emissions. Projections indicated that by 2050, emissions in all non-Annex I regions would need to be substantially reduced below \"business-as-usual\".\nThe agreement is a protocol to the  (UNFCCC) adopted at the  in  in 1992, which did not set any legally binding limitations on emissions or enforcement mechanisms. Only Parties to the UNFCCC can become Parties to the Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol was adopted at the third session of the Conference of Parties to the UNFCCC (COP 3) in 1997 in Kyoto, Japan.\nNational emission targets specified in the Kyoto Protocol exclude international aviation and shipping. Kyoto Parties can use , land use change, and  (LULUCF) in meeting their targets. LULUCF activities are also called \"sink\" activities. Changes in sinks and land use can have an effect on the climate, and indeed the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Special Report on  estimates that since 1750 a third of global warming has been caused by land use change. Particular criteria apply to the definition of forestry under the Kyoto Protocol.\n,  management,  land management, and  are all eligible LULUCF activities under the Protocol. Annex I Parties use of forest management in meeting their targets is capped.\nArticle 4.2 of the UNFCCC commits industrialized countries to \"[take] the lead\" in reducing emissions. The initial aim was for industrialized countries to stabilize their emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000. The failure of key industrialized countries to move in this direction was a principal reason why Kyoto moved to binding commitments.\nAt the first UNFCCC Conference of the Parties in Berlin, the  was able to push for a mandate (the \"Berlin mandate\") where it was recognized that:\nDuring negotiations, the G-77 represented 133 developing countries. China was not a member of the group but an associate. It has since become a member.\nThe Berlin mandate was recognized in the Kyoto Protocol in that developing countries were not subject to emission reduction commitments in the first Kyoto commitment period. However, the large potential for growth in developing country emissions made negotiations on this issue tense. In the final agreement, the Clean Development Mechanism was designed to limit emissions in developing countries, but in such a way that developing countries do not bear the costs for limiting emissions. The general assumption was that developing countries would face quantitative commitments in later commitment periods, and at the same time, developed countries would meet their first round commitments.\n contains a list of the emissions cuts that were proposed by UNFCCC Parties during negotiations. The G77 and China were in favour of strong uniform emission cuts across the developed world. The US originally proposed for the second round of negotiations on Kyoto commitments to follow the negotiations of the first. In the end, negotiations on the second period were set to open no later than 2005. Countries over-achieving in their first period commitments can \"bank\" their unused allowances for use in the subsequent period.\nThe EU initially argued for only three GHGs to be included \u2013 , , and  \u2013 with other gases such as HFCs regulated separately. The EU also wanted to have a \"bubble\" commitment, whereby it could make a collective commitment that allowed some EU members to increase their emissions, while others cut theirs.\nThe most vulnerable nations \u2013 the  (AOSIS) \u2013 pushed for deep uniform cuts by developed nations, with the goal of having emissions reduced to the greatest possible extent. Countries that had supported differentiation of targets had different ideas as to how it should be calculated, and many different indicators were proposed. Two examples include differentiation of targets based on  (GDP), and differentiation based on  (energy use per unit of economic output).\nThe final targets negotiated in the Protocol are the result of last minute political compromises. The targets closely match those decided by Argentinian Raul Estrada, the  who chaired the negotiations. The numbers given to each Party by Chairman Estrada were based on targets already pledged by Parties, information received on latest negotiating positions, and the goal of achieving the strongest possible environmental outcome. The final targets are weaker than those proposed by some Parties, e.g., the  and the G-77 and China, but stronger than the targets proposed by others, e.g., Canada and the United States.\nThe Protocol also reaffirms the principle that developed countries have to pay billions of dollars, and supply technology to other countries for climate-related studies and projects. The principle was originally agreed in . One such project is \"\", that has been established by the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change to finance concrete adaptation projects and programmes in developing countries that are Parties to the Kyoto Protocol.\nThe protocol left several issues open to be decided later by the sixth Conference of Parties  of the UNFCCC, which attempted to resolve these issues at its meeting in  in late 2000, but it was unable to reach an agreement due to disputes between the European Union (who favoured a tougher implementation) and the United States, Canada, Japan and Australia (who wanted the agreement to be less demanding and more flexible).\nIn 2001, a continuation of the previous meeting (COP6bis) was held in  where the required decisions were adopted. After some concessions, the supporters of the protocol (led by the ) managed to get the agreement of Japan and  by allowing more use of .\n was held from 29 October 2001 through 9 November 2001 in  to establish the final details of the protocol.\nThe first Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (MOP1) was held in  from 28 November to 9 December 2005, along with the 11th conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP11). See .\nDuring COP13 in Bali, 36 developed  countries (plus the EU as a party in the ) agreed to a 10% emissions increase for ; but, since the EU's member states each have individual obligations, much larger increases (up to 27%) are allowed for some of the less developed EU countries (see below ). Reduction limitations expired in 2013.\nThe protocol defines a mechanism of \"compliance\" as a \"monitoring compliance with the commitments and penalties for non-compliance.\" According to Grubb (2003), the explicit consequences of non-compliance of the treaty are weak compared to domestic law. Yet, the compliance section of the treaty was highly contested in the Marrakesh Accords.\nIf the enforcement branch determines that an Annex I country is not in compliance with its emissions limitation, then that country is required to make up the difference during the second commitment period plus an additional 30%. In addition, that country will be suspended from making transfers under an emissions trading program.\nThe Protocol was adopted by  of UNFCCC on 11 December 1997 in , . It was opened on 16 March 1998 for signature during one year by parties to , when it was signed Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, the Maldives, Samoa, St. Lucia and Switzerland. At the end of the signature period, 82 countries and the  had signed.  (which is required to become a party to the Protocol) started on 17 September with ratification of Fiji. Countries that did not sign acceded to the convention, which has the same legal effect.\nArticle 25 of the Protocol specifies that the Protocol enters into force \"on the ninetieth day after the date on which not less than 55 Parties to the Convention, incorporating Parties included in  which accounted in total for at least 55% of the total carbon dioxide emissions for 1990 of the  countries, have deposited their instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession.\"\nThe EU and its Member States ratified the Protocol in May 2002. Of the two conditions, the \"55 parties\" clause was reached on 23 May 2002 when  ratified the Protocol. The ratification by  on 18 November 2004 satisfied the \"55%\" clause and brought the treaty into force, effective 16 February 2005, after the required lapse of 90 days.\nAs of May 2013,  and one regional economic organization (the ) have ratified the agreement, representing over 61.6% of the 1990 emissions from  countries.

To become binding in the US, however, the treaty had to be ratified by the , which had already passed the 1997 non-binding , expressing disapproval of any international agreement that did not require developing countries to make emission reductions and \"would seriously harm the economy of the United States\". The resolution passed 95\u20130. Therefore, even though the  signed the treaty, it was never submitted to the Senate for ratification.\n\nWhen  was elected US president in 2000, he was asked by   what his administration's position was on climate change. Bush replied that he took climate change \"very seriously\", but that he opposed the Kyoto treaty because \"it exempts 80% of the world, including major population centers such as China and India, from compliance, and would cause serious harm to the US economy.\" The  for Climate Change Research reported in 2001:This policy reversal received a massive wave of criticism that was quickly picked up by the international media. Environmental groups blasted the White House, while Europeans and Japanese alike expressed deep concern and regret. [...] Almost all world leaders (e.g. China, Japan, South Africa, Pacific Islands, etc.) expressed their disappointment at Bush's decision.In response to this criticism, Bush stated: \"I was responding to reality, and reality is the nation has got a real problem when it comes to energy.\" The Tyndall Centre called this \"an overstatement used to cover up the big benefactors of this policy reversal, i.e., the US oil and coal industry, which has a powerful lobby with the administration and conservative  congressmen.\"\nAs of 2016, the US is the only signatory that has not ratified the Protocol. The US accounted for 36% of emissions in 1990. As such, for the treaty to go into legal effect without US ratification, it would require a coalition including the EU, Russia, Japan, and small parties. A deal, without the US Administration, was reached in the Bonn climate talks (COP-6.5), held in 2001.\nIn 2011, Canada, Japan and Russia stated that they would not take on further Kyoto targets. The Canadian government announced its withdrawal\u2014possible at any time three years after ratification\u2014from the Kyoto Protocol on 12 December 2011, effective 15 December 2012. Canada was committed to cutting its greenhouse emissions to 6% below 1990 levels by 2012, but in 2009 emissions were 17% higher than in 1990. The  government prioritized oil sands development in Alberta, and deprioritized the reduction of greenhouse emissions. Environment minister  cited Canada's liability to \"enormous financial penalties\" under the treaty unless it withdrew. He also suggested that the recently signed  may provide an alternative way forward. The Harper government claimed it would find a \"Made in Canada\" solution. Canada's decision received a generally negative response from representatives of other ratifying countries.\nAndorra, , , the United States and, following their withdrawal on 15 December 2012, Canada are the only UNFCCC Parties that are not party to the Protocol. Furthermore, the Protocol is not applied to UNFCCC observer the . Although the  approved the protocol for the whole Kingdom, it did not deposit an instrument of ratification for Aruba, Cura\u00e7ao, Sint Maarten or the .\nTotal aggregate GHG emissions excluding emissions/removals from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF, i.e., carbon storage in forests and soils) for all Annex I Parties (see list below) including the United States taken together decreased from 19.0 to 17.8 thousand  (Tg, which is equal to 10\u00a0kg)  equivalent, a decline of 6.0% during the 1990\u20132008 period. Several factors have contributed to this decline. The first is due to the economic restructuring in the Annex I Economies in Transition (the EITs \u2013 see  for the list of EITs). Over the period 1990\u20131999, emissions fell by 40% in the EITs following the collapse of  in the former  and  countries. This led to a massive contraction of their heavy industry-based economies, with associated reductions in their fossil fuel consumption and emissions.\nEmissions growth in Annex I Parties have also been limited due to policies and measures (PaMs). In particular, PaMs were strengthened after 2000, helping to enhance energy efficiency and develop renewable energy sources. Energy use also decreased during the economic crisis in 2007\u20132008.\nCollectively the group of industrialized countries committed to a Kyoto target, i.e., the Annex I countries excluding the US, had a target of reducing their GHG emissions by 4.2% on average for the period 2008\u20132012 relative to the base year, which in most cases is 1990.\nAs noted in the preceding section, between 1990\u20131999, there was a large reduction in the emissions of the EITs. The reduction in the EITs is largely responsible for the total (aggregate) reduction (excluding LULUCF) in emissions of the Annex I countries, excluding the US. Emissions of the Annex II countries (Annex I minus the EIT countries) have experienced a limited increase in emissions from 1990\u20132006, followed by stabilization and a more marked decrease from 2007 onwards. The emissions reductions in the early nineties by the 12 EIT countries who have since joined the EU, assist the present EU-27 in meeting its collective Kyoto target.\nIn December 2011, Canada's environment minister, , formally announced that  would withdraw from the Kyoto accord a day after the end of the  (see the section on the ).\nBelarus, Malta, and Turkey are Annex I Parties but did not have first-round Kyoto targets. The US had a Kyoto target of a 7% reduction relative to the 1990 level, but has not ratified the treaty. If the US had ratified the Kyoto Protocol, the average percentage reduction in total GHG emissions for the Annex I group would have been a 5.2% reduction relative to the base year.\n38 developed countries committed to limiting their greenhouse gas emissions. Because the United States did not ratify and Canada withdrew, the emission limits remained in force for 36 countries. All of them complied with the Protocol. However, nine countries (Austria, Denmark, Iceland, Japan, Lichtenstein, Luxembourg, Norway, Spain and Switzerland) had to resort to the flexibility mechanisms because their national emissions were slightly greater than their targets.\nIn total, the 36 countries that fully participated in the Protocol were committed to reducing their aggregate emissions by 4% from the 1990 base year. Their average annual emissions in 2008\u20132012 were 24.2% below the 1990 level. Hence, they surpassed their aggregate commitment by a large margin. If the United States and Canada are included, the emissions decreased by 11.8%. The large reductions were mainly thanks to the , which reduced the emissions of the  by tens of percents in the early 1990s. In addition, the  significantly reduced emissions during the first Kyoto commitment period.\nThe 36 countries that were committed to emission reductions only accounted for 24% of the global greenhouse gas emissions in 2010. Even though these countries significantly reduced their emissions during the Kyoto commitment period, other countries increased their emissions so much that the global emissions increased by 32% from 1990 to 2010.\nUNFCCC (2005) compiled and synthesized information reported to it by non-Annex I Parties. Most non-Annex I Parties belonged in the low-income group, with very few classified as middle-income. Most Parties included information on policies relating to . Sustainable development priorities mentioned by non-Annex I Parties included poverty alleviation and access to basic education and health care. Many non-Annex I Parties are making efforts to amend and update their  to include global concerns such as climate change.\nA few Parties, e.g., South Africa and , stated their concern over how efforts to reduce emissions by Annex I Parties could adversely affect their economies. The economies of these countries are highly dependent on income generated from the production, processing, and export of .\n\nGHG emissions, excluding land use change and forestry (LUCF), reported by 122 non-Annex I Parties for the year 1994 or the closest year reported, totalled 11.7\u00a0billion tonnes (billion\u00a0=\u00a01,000,000,000) of CO-eq. CO was the largest proportion of emissions (63%), followed by  (26%) and  (NO) (11%).\nThe  was the largest source of emissions for 70 Parties, whereas for 45 Parties the agriculture sector was the largest. Per capita emissions (in tonnes of CO-eq, excluding LUCF) averaged 2.8\u00a0tonnes for the 122 non-Annex I Parties.\nParties reported a high level of uncertainty in LUCF emissions, but in aggregate, there appeared to only be a small difference of 1.7% with and without LUCF. With LUCF, emissions were 11.9\u00a0billion\u00a0tonnes, without LUCF, total aggregate emissions were 11.7\u00a0billion\u00a0tonnes.\n\nIn several large developing countries and fast growing economies (China, India, Thailand, Indonesia, Egypt, and Iran) GHG emissions have increased rapidly (PBL, 2009). For example, emissions in China have risen strongly over the 1990\u20132005 period, often by more than 10% year. Emissions per-capita in non-Annex I countries are still, for the most part, much lower than in industrialized countries. Non-Annex I countries do not have quantitative emission reduction commitments, but they are committed to mitigation actions. China, for example, has had a national policy programme to reduce emissions growth, which included the closure of old, less efficient coal-fired power plants.\nBarker  (2007, p.\u00a079) assessed the literature on cost estimates for the Kyoto Protocol. Due to non-US participation in the Kyoto treaty, costs estimates were found to be much lower than those estimated in the previous . Without the U.S. participation, and with full use of the Kyoto flexible mechanisms, costs were estimated at less than 0.05% of Annex B GDP. This compared to earlier estimates of 0.1\u20131.1%. Without use of the flexible mechanisms, costs without the U.S. participation were estimated at less than 0.1%. This compared to earlier estimates of 0.2\u20132%. These cost estimates were viewed as being based on much evidence and high agreement in the literature.\nGupta  (2007) assessed the literature on climate change policy. They found that no authoritative assessments of the UNFCCC or its Protocol asserted that these agreements had, or will, succeed in solving the climate problem. In these assessments, it was assumed that the UNFCCC or its Protocol would not be changed. The Framework Convention and its Protocol include provisions for future policy actions to be taken.\nGupta  (2007) described the Kyoto first-round commitments as \"modest,\" stating that they acted as a constraint on the treaty's effectiveness. It was suggested that subsequent Kyoto commitments could be made more effective with measures aimed at achieving deeper cuts in emissions, as well as having policies applied to a larger share of global emissions. In 2008, countries with a Kyoto cap made up less than one-third of annual global carbon dioxide emissions from fuel .\nWorld Bank (2010) commented on how the Kyoto Protocol had only had a slight effect on curbing global emissions growth. The treaty was negotiated in 1997, but in 2006, energy-related carbon dioxide emissions had grown by 24%. World Bank (2010) also stated that the treaty had provided only limited financial support to developing countries to assist them in reducing their emissions and adapting to climate change.\nSome of the  has been based on the idea of climate justice (Liverman, 2008, p.\u00a014).\n\nThis has particularly centered on the balance between the low emissions and high vulnerability of the developing world to climate change, compared to high emissions in the developed world. Another criticism of the Kyoto Protocol and other international conventions, is the right of indigenous peoples right to participate. Quoted here from The Declaration of the , it says \"Despite the recognition of our role in preventing global warming, when it comes time to sign international conventions like the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, once again, our right to participate in national and international discussions that directly affect or Peoples and territories is denied.\" Additionally, later in the declaration, it reads \"We denounce the fact that neither the [United Nations] nor the Kyoto Protocol recognizes the existence or the contributions of Indigenous Peoples. Furthermore, the debates under these instruments have not considered the suggestions and proposals of the Indigenous Peoples nor have the appropriate mechanisms to guarantee our participation in all the debates that directly concern the Indigenous Peoples has been established.\"Some environmentalists have supported the Kyoto Protocol because it is \"the only game in town,\" and possibly because they expect that future emission reduction commitments may demand more stringent emission reductions (Aldy ., 2003, p.\u00a09). In 2001, seventeen national science academies stated that ratification of the Protocol represented a \"small but essential first step towards stabilising atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases.\" Some environmentalists and scientists have criticized the existing commitments for being too weak (Grubb, 2000, p.\u00a05).\nThe United States (under former President ) and Australia (initially, under former Prime Minister ) did not ratify the Kyoto treaty. According to Stern (2006), their decision was based on the lack of quantitative emission commitments for emerging economies (see also the  section). Australia, under former Prime Minister , has since ratified the treaty, which took effect in March 2008.\nAnother area which has been commented on is the role of the Kyoto  \u2013 , , and the  (CDM). The flexibility mechanisms have attracted both positive and negative comments.\nAs mentioned earlier, a number of Annex I Parties have implemented emissions trading schemes (ETSs) as part of efforts to meet their Kyoto commitments. General commentaries on emissions trading are contained in  and . Individual articles on the ETSs contain commentaries on these schemes (see  for a list of ETSs).\nOne of the arguments made in favour of the flexibility mechanisms is that they can reduce the costs incurred by Annex I Parties in meeting their Kyoto commitments. Criticisms of flexibility have, for example, included the ineffectiveness of emissions trading in promoting investment in non-fossil energy sources, and adverse impacts of CDM projects on local communities in developing countries.\nAs the Kyoto Protocol seeks to reduce environmental pollutants while at the same time altering the freedoms of some citizens.\nAs discussed by , one can achieve both economic and political freedom through capitalism; nonetheless, it is never guaranteed that one is going to have equality of wealth of those on top of the \"food chain\" of this capitalistic world. All these alterations come to what the leaders of the citizens choose to impose in means of improving ones lifestyle. In the case of the Kyoto Protocol, it seeks to impose regulations that will reduce production of pollutants towards the  environment. Furthermore, seeking to compromise the freedoms of both private and public citizens. In one side it imposes bigger regulations towards companies and reducing their profits as they need to fulfil such regulations with, which are oftentimes more expensive, alternatives for production. On the other hand, it seeks to reduce the emissions that cause the rapid environmental change called .\nThe conditions of the Kyoto Protocol consist of mandatory targets on greenhouse gas emissions for the world's leading economies. As provided by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, \"These targets range from \u22128 per cent to +10 per cent of the countries' individual 1990 emissions levels with a view to reducing their overall emissions of such gases by at least 5 per cent below existing 1990 levels in the commitment period 2008 to 2012.\"\nThese goals are challenged, however, by climate change deniers, who condemn strong scientific evidence of the human impact on climate change. One prominent scholar opines that these climate change deniers \"arguably\" breach Rousseau's notion of the social contract, which is an implicit agreement among the members of a society to coordinate efforts in the name of overall social benefit. The climate change denial movement hinders efforts at coming to agreements as a collective global society on climate change.\nThe official meeting of all states party to the Kyoto Protocol is the . It is held every year as part of the United Nations Climate Change conference, which also serves as the formal meeting of UNFCCC. The first Meetings of Parties of the Kyoto Protocol (CMP) was held in 2005 in conjunction with the eleventh Conferences of parties to UNFCCC (COP). Also parties to the Convention that are not parties to the Protocol can participate in Protocol-related meetings as observers. The first conference was held in 1995 in Berlin, while the 2013 conference was held in . Later COPs were held in Lima, Peru in 2014 and in Paris, France in 2015. COP 21 aims to hold the increase in the global average rise in temperature below 2 degree. COP 22 Marakash, Morocco and COP 23 in Bonn, Germany.\nIn the non-binding \"\" agreed on 16 February 2007, heads of governments from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States, Brazil, , ,  and  agreed in principle on the outline of a successor to the Kyoto Protocol. They envisaged a global cap-and-trade system that would apply to both industrialized nations and , and initially hoped that it would be in place by 2009.\nThe United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen in December 2009 was one of the annual series of UN meetings that followed the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio. In 1997 the talks led to the Kyoto Protocol, and the conference in Copenhagen was considered to be the opportunity to agree a successor to Kyoto that would bring about meaningful carbon cuts.\nThe  include voluntary pledges made by 76 developed and developing countries to control their emissions of greenhouse gases. In 2010, these 76 countries were collectively responsible for 85% of annual global emissions.\nBy May 2012, the US, Japan, Russia, and Canada had indicated they would not sign up to a second Kyoto commitment period. In November 2012, Australia confirmed it would participate in a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol and New Zealand confirmed that it would not.\nNew Zealand's climate minister Tim Groser said the 15-year-old Kyoto Protocol was outdated, and that New Zealand was \"ahead of the curve\" in looking for a replacement that would include developing nations. Non-profit environmental organisations such as the  criticised New Zealand's decision to pull out.\nOn 8 December 2012, at the end of the , an agreement was reached to extend the Protocol to 2020 and to set a date of 2015 for the development of a successor document, to be implemented from 2020 (see lede for more information). The outcome of the Doha talks has received a mixed response, with small island states critical of the overall package. The Kyoto second commitment period applies to about 11% of annual global emissions of greenhouse gases. Other results of the conference include a timetable for a global agreement to be adopted by 2015 which includes all countries. At the Doha meeting of the parties to the UNFCCC on 8 December 2012, the European Union chief climate negotiator, Artur Runge-Metzger, pledged to extend the treaty, binding on the 27 European Member States, up to the year 2020 pending an internal ratification procedure.\nBan Ki Moon, Secretary General of the United Nations, called on world leaders to come to an agreement on halting global warming during the 69th Session of the UN General Assembly on 23 September 2014 in New York. The next climate summit was held , out of which emerged the , the successor to the Kyoto Protocol.\n"},

While some , such as  (Sr) and  (Tc), are only found on  as a result of human activity, and some, like  (K), are only present due to natural processes, a few isotopes,   (H), result from both natural processes and human activities. The concentration and location of some natural isotopes, particularly  (U), can be affected by human activity.\nRadioactivity is , and has been since the formation of the earth. Natural radioactivity detected in soil is predominantly due to the following four natural radioisotopes: K, Ra, U, and Th.  In one kilogram of soil, the potassium-40 amounts to an average 370\u00a0 of radiation, with a typical range of 100\u2013700\u00a0Bq; the others each contribute some 25\u00a0Bq, with typical ranges of 10\u201350\u00a0Bq (7\u201350\u00a0Bq for the Th). Some soils may vary greatly from these norms.\nA recent report on the  river in  suggests that many of the river silts contain about 100\u00a0Bq\u00a0kg of natural radioisotopes (Ra, Th, and U). According to the  the normal concentration of uranium in soil ranges between 300\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0kg and 11.7\u00a0mg\u00a0kg. It is well known that some plants, called , are able to absorb and concentrate metals within their tissues;  was first isolated from  in , which suggests that seaweed is an iodine hyperaccumulator.\nSynthetic radioisotopes also can be detected in silt. Busby quotes a report on the plutonium activity in Welsh intertidal sediments by Garland  (1989), which suggests that the closer a site is to , the higher is the concentration of plutonium in the silt. Some relationship between distance and activity can be seen in their data, when fitted to an exponential curve, but the scatter of the points is large (R = 0.3683).\nThe additional radioactivity in the biosphere caused by human activity due to the releases of man-made radioactivity and of Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials (NORM) can be divided into several classes.\nJust because a radioisotope lands on the surface of the soil, does not mean it will enter the  food chain.  After release into the environment, radioactive materials can reach humans in a range of different routes, and the chemistry of the element usually dictates the most likely route.\nJi\u0159\u00ed H\u00e1la claims in his textbook \"Radioactivity, Ionizing Radiation and Nuclear Energy\"  that  only pass a minority of the , ,  and  they ingest to the humans who consume  and .  Using milk as an example, if the cow has a daily intake of 1000 Bq of the preceding isotopes then the milk will have the following activities.\nJi\u0159\u00ed H\u00e1la's  states that soils vary greatly in their ability to bind radioisotopes, the  particles and  can alter the distribution of the isotopes between the soil water and the soil.  The distribution coefficient K is the ratio of the soil's radioactivity (Bq g) to that of the soil water (Bq ml).  If the radioactivity is tightly bonded to by the minerals in the soil then less radioactivity can be absorbed by crops and  growing in the soil.\nOne dramatic source of man-made radioactivity is a  test. The glassy  formed by the first atom bomb contains  formed by  and .  In addition some natural radioisotopes are present.  A recent paper reports the levels of long-lived radioisotopes in the trinitite. The trinitite was formed from  and  which were melted by the heat. Two samples of trinitite were used, the first (left-hand-side bars in the graph) was taken from between 40 and 65 meters of ground zero while the other sample was taken from further away from the  point.\nThe  (half life 13.54 year) and Eu (half life 8.59 year) were mainly formed by the neutron activation of the  in the soil, it is clear that the level of radioactivity for these isotopes is highest where the neutron dose to the  was larger.  Some of the  (half life 5.27 year) is generated by activation of the  in the soil, but some was also generated by the activation of the cobalt in the  (100\u00a0foot) tower.  This Co from the tower would have been scattered over the site reducing the difference in the soil levels.\nThe  (half life 10.5 year) and  (half life 432.6 year) are due to the neutron activation of barium and plutonium inside the bomb.  The  was present in the form of the nitrate in the chemical explosives used while the plutonium was the  fuel used.\nThe Cs level is higher in the sample that was further away from the ground zero point \u2013 this is thought to be because the precursors to the Cs (I and Xe) and, to a lesser degree, the caesium itself are volatile. The natural radioisotopes in the glass are about the same in both locations.\nThe action of  on stable  can form , for instance the neutron bombardment (neutron activation) of -14 forms -14. This radioisotope can be released from the ; this is the radioisotope responsible for the majority of the dose experienced by the population as a result of the activities of the  industry.\nNuclear bomb tests have increased the  of carbon, whereas the use of fossil fuels has decreased it. See the article on  for further details.\nDischarges from nuclear plants within the  introduce fission products to the environment. The releases from  plants tend to be medium to long-lived radioisotopes; this is because the  is allowed to cool for several years before being dissolved in the .  The releases from  accidents and bomb detonations will contain a greater amount of the short-lived radioisotopes (when the amounts are expressed in activity )).\nAn example of a short-lived fission product is , this can also be formed as an activation product by the  activation of .\nIn both bomb fallout and a release from a power reactor accident, the short-lived isotopes cause the dose rate on day one to be much higher than that which will be experienced at the same site many days later.  This holds true even if no attempts at decontamination are made.  In the graphs below, the total  rate and the share of the dose due to each main isotope released by the Chernobyl accident are shown.\nAn example of a medium lived is Cs, which has a half-life of 30 years. Caesium is released in bomb fallout and from the .  A paper has been written on the radioactivity in  found in the , these were found by  to contain Ce, Ce, Ru, Ru, Cs, Zr and Nb.  In addition, a  activation product (Zn) was found, this is thought to be due to the  of  fuel cladding in cooling ponds. The concentration of all these isotopes in the Irish Sea attributable to nuclear facilities such as Sellafield has significantly decreased in recent decades.\nAn important part of the  release was the caesium-137, this isotope is responsible for much of the long term (at least one year after the fire) external exposure which has occurred at the site.  The caesium isotopes in the fallout have had an effect on farming. \nA large amount of caesium was released during the  where a radioactive source (made for medical use) was stolen and then smashed open during an attempt to convert it into scrap metal.  The accident could have been stopped at several stages; first, the last legal owners of the source failed to make arrangements for the source to be stored in a safe and secure place; and second, the scrap metal workers who took it did not recognise the markings which indicated that it was a radioactive object.\nSoudek  reported in 2006 details of the uptake of Sr and Cs into  grown under  conditions.  The caesium was found in the leaf veins, in the stem and in the  leaves.  It was found that 12% of the caesium entered the plant, and 20% of the strontium.  This paper also reports details of the effect of ,  and  ions on the uptake of the radioisotopes.\nCaesium binds tightly to  minerals such as  and ; hence it remains in the upper layers of soil where it can be accessed by plants with shallow roots (such as grass).  Hence  and  can carry a considerable amount of Cs which can be transferred to humans through the .  One of the best countermeasures in dairy farming against Cs is to mix up the soil by deeply  the soil.  This has the effect of putting the Cs out of reach of the shallow  of the grass, hence the level of radioactivity in the grass will be lowered.  Also, after a nuclear war or serious accident, the removal of top few cm of  and its burial in a shallow trench will reduce the long term gamma dose to  due to Cs as the gamma  will be attenuated by their passage through the .  The more remote the trench is from humans and the deeper the trench is the better the degree of protection which will be afforded to the human population.\nIn  farming, an important countermeasure against Cs is to feed to animals a little . This    compound acts as an .  The cyanide is so tightly bonded to the iron that it is safe for a human to eat several grams of prussian blue per day.  The prussian blue reduces the  (not to be confused with the ) of the caesium).  The physical or nuclear half-life of Cs is about 30 years, which is a constant and can not be changed; however, the biological half-life will change according to the nature and habits of the organism for which it is expressed.  in humans normally has a biological half-life of between one and four months.  An added advantage of the prussian blue is that the caesium which is stripped from the animal in the  is in a form which is not available to plants.  Hence, it prevents the caesium from being recycled.  The form of prussian blue required for the treatment of humans or animals is a special grade.  Attempts to use the  grade used in  have not been successful.\nExamples of longed lived isotopes include -129 and Tc-99, which have nuclear half-lives of 15 million and 200,000 years, respectively.\nIn popular culture, plutonium is credited with being the ultimate threat to  which is wrong; while ingesting plutonium is not likely to be good for one's health, other radioisotopes such as  are more toxic to humans.  Regardless, the introduction of the  elements such as  into the  should be avoided wherever possible.  Currently, the activities of the  industry have been subject to great debate as one of the fears of those opposed to the industry is that large amounts of plutonium will be either mismanaged or released into the environment.\nIn the past, one of the largest releases of plutonium into the environment has been  testing.\n (or ) are rare  created when a high-energy  interacts with the  of an  .  These isotopes are produced within earth materials such as  or , in  , and in extraterrestrial items such as .  By measuring cosmogenic isotopes,  are able to gain insight into a range of  and  processes.  There are both  and  cosmogenic isotopes.  Some of these radioisotopes are , -14 and -32.\nHere is a list of radioisotopes formed by the action of  on the atmosphere; the list also contains the production mode of the isotope. .\nThe level of -7 in the air is related to the  cycle, as radiation from the sun forms this  in the atmosphere.  The rate at which it is transferred from the air to the ground is controlled in part by the weather.\nBecause cosmogenic isotopes have long  (anywhere from thousands to millions of years), scientists find them useful for geologic .  Cosmogenic isotopes are produced at or near the surface of the Earth, and thus are commonly applied to problems of measuring ages and rates of  and  events and processes.\nSpecific applications of cosmogenic isotopes include:\nTo measure cosmogenic isotopes produced within solid earth materials, such as rock, samples are generally first put through a process of mechanical separation. The sample is crushed and desirable material, such as a particular mineral ( in the case of Be-10), is separated from non-desirable material by using a density separation in a heavy liquid medium such as  (LST). The sample is then dissolved, a common isotope carrier added (Be-9 carrier in the case of Be-10), and the aqueous solution is purified down to an oxide or other pure solid.\nFinally, the ratio of the rare cosmogenic isotope to the common isotope is measured using  . The original concentration of cosmogenic isotope in the sample is then calculated using the measured isotopic ratio, the mass of the sample, and the mass of carrier added to the sample.\n and  are in the environment because they are decay products of  and .\nThe radon (Rn) released into the air decays to Pb and other radioisotopes, and the levels of  can be measured. The rate of deposition of this radioisotope is dependent on the weather.  Below is a graph of the deposition rate observed in .\n- dating is usually performed on the mineral  (ZrSiO), though other materials can be used.  Zircon incorporates uranium  into its crystalline structure as substitutes for , but strongly rejects lead. It has a high blocking temperature, is resistant to mechanical weathering and is chemically inert.  Zircon also forms multiple crystal layers during metamorphic events, which each may record an isotopic age of the event. These can be dated by a SHRIMP  microprobe.\nOne of the advantages of this method is that any sample provides two clocks, one based on uranium-235's decay to lead-207 with a  of about 703 million years, and one based on uranium-238's decay to lead-206 with a half-life of about 4.5 billion years, providing a built-in crosscheck that allows accurate determination of the age of the sample even if some of the lead has been lost.\n"},

Its action is largely influenced by  and , , complexation of radioactive particles with the material and . These are measures that can be performed on the source of contamination () or in controlled and limited facilities in order to follow the  more accurately and combine it with other systems ().\nThe presence of radioactive waste in the environment may cause long-term effects due to the  and  of the radionuclides, leading their impact to grow with time. These particles exist in various  and are found as , , or as  or  complexes, according to their origin and ways of liberation. Most commonly they are found in oxidized form, which makes them more soluble in water and thus more mobile. Unlike organic contaminants, however, they cannot be destroyed and must be converted into a stable form or extracted from the environment.\nThe sources of radioactivity are not exclusive of human activity. The  does not come from human sources: it covers up to \u00be of the total radioactivity in the world and has its origins in the interaction of terrestrial elements with high energy  () or in the existing materials on  since its formation (). In this regard, there are differences in the levels of radioactivity throughout the .  and mountains like the  are among the areas with the highest level of natural radioactivity due to their composition of  and .\nThe most frequent radionuclides in soils are naturally  (Ra),  (Rn),  (Th),  (U) and  (K). Potassium-40 (up to 88% of total activity),  (C), ,  and  (Rb) are found in  waters. Moreover, in  abound radius radioisotopes such as radium-226 and  (Ra). They are also habitual in  radionuclides of uranium, thorium and potassium (the latter common to ).\nAt the same time,  (caused by humans) are due to  resulting from  and  tests, discharges from , accidents deriving from the reprocessing of commercial , waste storage from these processes and to a lesser extent, . Some polluted sites by these radionuclides are the  facilities (like ), the  and   and the affected area of  due to the .\nIn ocean waters, the presence of  (H),  (Cs),  (Sr),  (Pu) and  (Pu) has significantly increased due to anthropogenic causes. In soils,  (Tc), carbon-14, strontium-90,  (Co),  (I),  (I),  (Am),  (Np) and various forms of radioactive plutonium and uranium are the most common radionuclides.\nThe classification of radioactive waste established by the  (IAEA) distinguishes six levels according to , ,  released and  of the radionuclides:\nRadioactive contamination is a potential danger for living organisms and results in external hazards, concerning radiation sources outside the body, and internal dangers, as a result of the incorporation of radionuclides inside the body (often by  of particles or  of ).\nIn humans, single doses from 0.25  produce first anomalies in the amount of . This effect is accentuated if the  is between 0.5 and 2 Sv, in whose first damage,  and  are suffered. The strip ranging between 2 and 5 Sv is considered the most serious and include ,  and risk of ; values exceeding 5 Sv involve immediate death. If radiation, likewise, is received in small doses over long periods of time, the consequences can be equally severe. It is difficult to quantify the health effects for doses below 10 , but it has been shown that there is a direct relationship between prolonged exposure and  risk (although there is not a very clear dose-response relationship to establish clear limits of exposure).\nThe information available on the effect of natural background radiation with respect anthropogenic pollution on  is scarce and refers to very few species. It is very difficult to estimate from the available data the total doses that can accumulate during specific stages of the  ( or reproductive age), in changes in  or depending on  such as . The phenomena of radioactive ,  and , however, are especially known to sea level. They are caused by the recruitment and retention of radioisotopes by , ,  and , which then amounted to the rest of the  at low concentration factors.\n literature and  establish a safe limit of absorbed dose of 0.001 / for  and 0.01 Gy/d for  and , although this limit should be reconsidered for long-lived species with low reproductive capacity.\nRadiation tests in  that determine the effects of high radiation on animals and plants are:\nThe effects of radioactivity on  are given, as in , by  and production of . These compounds mutate  and produce , inducing newly  and subsequent .\nIts action on viruses, on the other hand, results in damaged  and viral inactivation. They have a  ranging between 1000 and 10,000 Gy (range occupying most biological organisms) which decreases with increasing .\nThe biochemical transformation of radionuclides into stable isotopes by  significantly differs from the metabolism of  coming from carbon sources. They are highly energetic radioactive forms which can be converted indirectly by the process of microbial .\nRadioisotopes can be transformed directly through changes in  by acting as  or by acting as  to . They can also be transformed indirectly by  and  produced by microorganisms that cause changes in  or . Other processes include  and complexation of , or  that bind to radioactive elements. Human intervention, on the other hand, can improve these processes through  and , or by injection of microorganisms or  into the treatment area.\nAccording to the radioactive element and the specific site conditions, bacteria can enzymatically immobilize radionuclides directly or indirectly. Their  is exploited by some microbial species to carry out reductions that alter the  and hence, mobility,  and . This waste treatment technique called bioreduction or enzymatic biotransformation is very attractive because it can be done in mild conditions for the environment, does not produce hazardous secondary waste and has potential as a solution for waste of various kinds.\nDirect enzymatic reduction is the change of radionuclides of a higher oxidation state to a lower one made by  and . The radioisotope interact with binding sites of metabolically active cells and is used as  in the  where compounds such as  act as  under .\nThe  plays a very important role in these bioreductions. In the reduction of  (VI) to insoluble uranium (IV), made by , ,  and , the activity of periplasmic  is required. The reduction of  (VII) to technetium (IV) made by , , ,  and , on the other hand, requires the presence of the complex , also placed in this cell compartment.\nOther radioactive  such as , ,  and  are enzymatically reduced by ,  and several species of , and directly form an insoluble  phase.\nThe phenomenon of indirect enzymatic reduction is carried out by  and  on  reactions of  and breakdown products. There is a coupling of the  of  \u2014produced by the excretion of these \u2014 with the reduction of  or other  and radionuclides, which forms insoluble compounds that can precipitate as  and . In the case of sulfate-reducing bacteria hydrogen sulfide is produced, promoting increased solubility of polluting radionuclides and their  (as liquid waste that can then be recovered).\nThere are several species of reducing microorganisms that produce indirect  and specific , such as . These sequestering agents are crucial in the complexation of radionuclides and increasing their solubility and bioavailability. , for example, grows in the presence of radioisotopes such as plutonium, thorium, uranium or americium and produces organic acids and siderophores that allow the dissolution and mobilization of radionuclides through the soil. It seems that siderophores on bacterial surface could also facilitate the entry of these elements within the cell as well.  also secretes chelating agents out that meet uranium and thorium when grown in a medium with these elements. In general, it has also been found that  siderophores are extremely effective in solubilizing actinide oxides of plutonium.\n is a chelator which binds to certain  and radioactive actinides. Stable complexes such as ,  (ligands with more than one atom bound) and polynuclear complexes (with several radioactive atoms) can be formed with citrate and radionuclides, which receive a microbial action. Anaerobically,  and species of the genera  and  are able to reduce bidentate complexes of  (VI) to uranyl-citrate (IV) and make them precipitate, despite not being able to degrade metabolically complexed citrate at the end of the process. In denitrifying and aerobic conditions, however, it has been determined that it is not possible to reduce or degrade these uranium complexes. Bioreduction do not get a head when they are citrate complex mixed metal complexes or when they are tridentate, monomeric or polynuclear complexes, since they become  and persistent in the environment. From this knowledge exists a system that combines the degradation of radionuclide-citrate complex with subsequent  of remaining reduced uranyl-citrate (previously not biodegradated but sensitive to ), which allows for stable precipitates of uranium and also of thorium, strontium or cobalt from contaminated lands.\nThe set of strategies that comprise biosorption, bioaccumulation and biomineralization are closely related to each other, because one way or another have a direct contact between the cell and radionuclide. These mechanisms are evaluated accurately using advanced analysis technologies such as ,  and ,  and .\nBiosorption and bioaccumulation are two metabolic actions that are based on the ability to concentrate radionuclides over a thousand times the concentration of the environment. They consist of complexation of radioactive waste with , organic compounds and  so that they become insoluble and less exposed to radiotoxicity. They are particularly useful in  for  purposes and , although most properties of these biosolids are unknown.\nBiosorption method is based on passive sequestration of positively charged radioisotopes by  (LPS) on the  (negatively charged), either live or dead bacteria. Its efficiency is directly related to the increase in temperature and can last for hours, being a much faster method than direct bioreduction. It occurs through the formation of  and capsules, and with a preference for binding to the  and  groups (although it also occurs with ,  or  groups).  and other bacteria like  have significant biosorption capabilities;  does it through  of uranium with phosphates of their LPS.\nQuantitative analyzes determine that, in the case of uranium, biosorption may vary within a range between 45 and 615  per gram of cell . However, it is a technique that requires a high amount of biomass to affect bioremediation; it presents problems of  and other cations that compete for binding to the bacterial surface.\nBioaccumulation refers to uptake of radionuclides into the cell, where they are retained by complexations with negatively charged intracellular components, precipitation or  formations. Unlike biosorption, this is an : it depends on an energy-dependent transport system.  Some metals or radionuclides can be absorbed by bacteria accidentally because of its resemblance to  for . Several radioisotopes of , for example, are recognized as analogs of  and incorporated within . , however, has no known function and is believed that its entry into the cell interior may be due to its toxicity (it is able to increase ).\nFurthermore, biomineralization \u2014also known as bioprecipitation\u2014 is the  of radionuclides through the generation of microbial ligands, resulting in the formation of stable . These minerals have a very important role in the retention of radioactive contaminants. A very localized and produced enzymatically ligand concentration is involved and provides a  for the onset of biomineral precipitation. This is particularly relevant in precipitations of  activity-derivate biominerals, which cleavage molecules such as  on . In  and  genera, this cleavage liberates inorganic phosphates (HPO) that precipitates with uranyl ion (UO) and cause deposition of  around the cell wall.  also form  that promote precipitation of chernikovite (rich in uranium) and additionally, remove up to 85% of  and 97% of  by  of this mineral. In general, biomineralization is a process in which the cells do not have limitations of saturation and can accumulate up to several times its own weight as precipitated radionuclides.\nInvestigations of terrestrial and marine bacterial isolates belonging to the genera , , , , ,  and  have also demonstrated the removal of uranium radioisotopes as phosphate biominerals in both  and  growth conditions.\nAside from bioreduction, biosorption, bioaccumulation and biomineralization, which are bacterial strategies for natural attenuation of radioactive contamination, there are also human methods that increase the efficiency or speed of microbial processes. This accelerated natural attenuation involves an intervention in the contaminated area to improve conversion rates of radioactive waste, which tend to be slow. There are two variants: biostimulation and bioaugmentation.\nBiostimulation is the addition of nutrients with ,  or  to stimulate activity and growth of natural  communities. It can range from simple  or infiltration (called passive biostimulation) to more aggressive injections to the ground, and is widely used at  sites.  is used as nutrient to biostimulate the reduction of , because it serves as very energetically favorable  for . However, many of these microorganisms (,  or ) exhibit  to  that limit their ability to bioremediate radionuclides. In these particular cases, a carbon source such as  is added to the medium to promote the reduction of nitrate at first, and then of . Ethanol is also used in soil injection systems with  : it raises the  and promotes the growth of  and radionuclide-reducing bacteria, that produce  and achieve almost 90% decrease in the concentration of radioactive uranium.\nA number of  techniques have been used to monitor the effects of in situ biostimulation trials including measurement of: , , ,  and also  (RTM), which measures  and  parameters to estimate chemical reactions of the microbial community.\nBioaugmentaton, on the other hand, is the deliberated addition to the environment of microorganisms with desired traits to accelerate bacterial metabolic conversion of radioactive waste. They are often added when necessary species for bioremediation do not exist in the treatment place. This technique has shown in field trials over the years that it does not offer better results than biostimulation; neither it is clear that introduced species can be distributed effectively through the complex geological structures of most  environments or that can compete long term with the indigenous microbiota.\nOmics, especially genomics and proteomics, allow identifying and evaluating ,  and  involved in radionuclide bioremediation, apart from the structural and functional interactions that exist between them and other metabolites.  of various microorganisms has uncovered, for example, that  possess more than 100   for  involved in bioremediation radionuclide, or that  gene is significantly overexpressed in  and  when grown in medium with radioactive .\nFrom this information, different genetic engineering and  techniques are being developed to generate specific bacteria for bioremediation. Some  expressed in microbial species are ,  and other  by  to outer-membrane-anchored proteins. Some of these genetically modified strains are derived from , one of the most radiation-resistant organisms.  is capable to resist  and  from radiation, and reduces ,  and  naturally as well. Besides, through insertion of genes from other species it has been achieved that it can also precipitates  and degrades  by using  as an energy source to grow and stabilize other priority radionuclides.\n of bacterial proteins related to bioremediation of radionuclides is also a field research.  enzyme, for example, naturally catalyzes the reduction of  with a very wide range of . Following , however, it has also been able to participate in  reduction.\nThe use of plants to remove contaminants from the environment or to render them less harmful is called phytoremediation. In the case of radionuclides, it is a viable technology when decontamination times are long and waste are scattered at low concentrations.\nSome plant species are able to transform the state of radioisotopes (without suffering toxicity) concentrating them in different parts of their structure, making them rush through the roots, making them volatile or stabilizing them on the ground. As in bacteria, plant  procedures and biostimulation \u2014called \u2014 have improved and accelerate these processes, particularly with regard to . The use of , for example, is quite widespread and significantly increases radionuclide uptake by the .\nIn phytoextraction (also phytoaccumulation, phytosequesteration or phytoabsorption) plants carry radioactive waste from the  to the  and become concentrated in the  of shoots. It is a technique that removes radionuclides without destroying the soil structure, with minimal impact on  and valid for large areas with a low level of radioactivity. Its efficiency is evaluated through  (BC) or total removal of radionuclides per , and is proven to attract , , , , , ,  and various radioisotopes of  and . By contrast, it requires large biomass production in short periods of time.\nSpecies like  or  are able to concentrate cesium-137, the most abundant radionuclide in the . In this region of ,  could remove up to 22% of average levels of cesium activity in a single growing season. In the same way,  and mustard greens can concentrate 100 times more  than other species.\nRhizofiltration is the adsorption and precipitation of radionuclides in plant roots or absorption thereof if soluble in effluents. It has great efficiency in the treatment of  and , particularly by  and , such as  and  genera, respectively. It is the most efficient strategy for bioremediation technologies in , but must have a continuous and rigorous control of  to make it an optimal process.\nFrom this process, some strategies have been designed based on sequences of  with a slow  of water to clean polluted water with radionuclides. The results of these facilities, for flows of 1000 liters of effluent are about 95% retention of radiation in the first pond (by plants and ), and over 99% in three-base systems.\nThe most promising plants for rhizofiltration are . They are able to remove up to 95% of  of contaminated water in 24 hours, and experiments in  have demonstrated that they can concentrate on 55\u00a0kg of plant  all the cesium and strontium radioactivity from an area of 75 m (stabilized material suitable for transfer to a nuclear waste repository).\nPhytovolatilization involves the capture and subsequent  of radionuclides into the . It does not remove contaminants but releases them in volatile form (less harmful). Despite not having too many applications for radioactive waste, it is very useful for the treatment of , because it exploits plants' ability to transpire enormous amounts of water.\nThe treatment applied to tritium (shielded by air produces almost no external radiation exposure, but its incorporation in water presents a health hazard when absorbed into the body) uses polluted effluents to  . It becomes a system with a low operation cost and low maintenance, with savings of about 30% in comparison to conventional methods of  and covering with .\nPhytostabilization is an specially valid strategy for radioactive contamination based on the immobilization of radionuclides in the soil by the action of the roots. This can occur by adsorption, absorption and precipitation within root zone, and ensures that radioactive waste can not be dispersed because  or . It is useful in controlling tailings from strip and open pit uranium mines, and guarantees to retrieve the . However, it has significant drawbacks such as large doses of  needed to reforest the area, apart from radioactive source (which implies long-term maintenance) remaining at the same place.\nSeveral fungi species have radioactive resistance values equal to or greater than more radioresistant bacteria; they perform mycoremediation processes. It was reported that some fungi had the ability of growing into, feeding, generating  and decomposing pieces of  from destroyed  at the , which is contaminated with high concentrations of ,  and  radionuclides. They were called .\nSince then, it has been shown that some species of , ,  and  are able to use  as energy through the electronic properties of . In their feeding they bioaccumulate radioisotopes, creating problems on  walls of . Other fungi like  can bioremediate  and .\nCurrent research on bioremediation techniques is fairly advanced and molecular mechanisms that govern them are well known. There are, however, many doubts about the effectiveness and possible adversities of these processes in combination with the addition of . In soils, the role of  on radioactive waste is poorly described and sequestration patterns of radionuclides are not known with certainty.\nLongevity effects of some bacterial processes, such as maintenance of uranium in insoluble form because of bioreductions or biomineralizations, are unknown. There are not clear details about the  from some radionuclides with these bacterial species either.\nAnother important aspect is the change of  or laboratory scale processes to their real application , in which soil heterogeneity and environmental conditions generate reproduction deficiencies of optimal biochemical status of the used species, a fact that decreases the efficiency. This implies finding what are the best conditions in which to carry out an efficient bioremediation with anions, metals, organic compounds or other chelating radionuclides that can compete with the uptake of interest radioactive waste. Nevertheless, in many cases research is focused on the extraction of soil and water and its  biological treatment to avoid these problems.\nFinally, the potential of  is limited by  in terms of  and  issues. Their release require support on the action zone and comparability with indigenous species. Multidisciplinary research is focused on defining more precisely necessary  and  to establish new  systems, which may avoid possible side effects on the environment by the intrusion of  or .\n"},

The use of depleted uranium (DU) in  is controversial because of questions about potential long-term health effects.\n is a naturally occurring element found in low levels within all rock, soil, and water. This is the highest-numbered element to be found naturally in significant quantities on earth. According to the  the normal concentration of uranium in soil is 300\u00a0\u03bcg/kg to 11.7\u00a0mg/kg.\nIt is considered to be more plentiful than , , , , , , or  and is about as abundant as ,  or . It is found in many minerals including  (most common uranium ore), , , , and . Significant concentrations of uranium occur in some substances such as  rock deposits, and minerals such as , and  sands in uranium-rich  (it is recovered commercially from these sources).\n contains about 3.3  of uranium by weight, approximately (3.3\u00a0\u00b5g/kg) or, 3.3\u00a0micrograms per  of seawater. as uranium(VI) forms soluble  complexes. The extraction of uranium from seawater has been considered as a means of obtaining the element.\nThe radiation hazards of uranium mining and milling were not appreciated in the early years, resulting in workers exposed to high levels of radiation. Conventional uranium ore treatment mills create radioactive waste in the form of , which contain uranium, radium, and polonium. Consequently, uranium mining results in \"the unavoidable radioactive contamination of the environment by solid, liquid and gaseous wastes\". Inhalation of  gas caused sharp increases in lung cancers among underground uranium miners employed in the 1940s and 1950s.\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, uranium mill tailings were released with impunity into water sources, and the radium leached from these tailings contaminated thousands of miles of the Colorado River system. Between 1966 and 1971, thousands of homes and commercial buildings in the Colorado Plateau region were \"found to contain anomalously high concentrations of radon, after being built on uranium tailings taken from piles under the authority of the Atomic Energy Commission\".\nDepleted uranium (DU) is useful because of its very high  of 19.1\u00a0/cm (68.4% denser than lead). Civilian uses include counterweights in aircraft, radiation shielding in medical  and industrial  equipment, and containers used to transport radioactive materials. Military uses include defensive armor plating and  .\nUranium metal can disperse into the air and water,  study says in part:\nStudies of depleted uranium aerosol exposure suggest that uranium combustion product particles would quickly settle out of the air, and thus could not affect populations more than a few kilometres from target areas.\nThe U.S. has admitted that there have been over 100 \"friendly fire\" incidents in which members of the U.S. military have been struck by DU munitions, and that an unknown number have been exposed to DU via inhalation of combustion products from burning DU munitions.\nIt has been reported that the corrosion of uranium in a silica rich aqueous solution forms both  and .\nIn pure water,  {(UO)O(OH).12(HO)} is formed  in the first week and then after four months  {(UO)O\u00b74(HO)} was formed.\nUranium  reacts with  to form  gas, this reaction forms  and 2% to 9% . It is important to note that the rate of corrosion due to water is far greater than that caused by oxygen at temperatures around 100\u00a0\u00b0C (212\u00a0\u00b0F). At pH values below 2 the corrosion rate at 100\u00a0\u00b0C goes down greatly, while as pH values go from 7 upwards the corrosion rate declines. Gamma irradiation has little effect on the corrosion rate.\nOxygen gas inhibits the corrosion of uranium by water.\n.\nSpent  fuel is very insoluble in water, it is likely to release uranium (and ) even more slowly than borosilicate glass when in contact with water.\nNote that while the vast majority of the uranium is removed by  , a small amount of uranium is left in the  from the first cycle of the PUREX process. In addition because of the decay of the transplutonium  and the residual  in the waste the concentration of uranium will increase on the waste. This will occur on a time scale of hundreds and thousands of years.\nSoluble uranium salts are , though less so than those of other heavy metals such as  or .

The federal government eventually regulated the standard amount of  in mines, setting the level at 0.3  on January 1, 1969.\nOut of 69 69 present and former uranium milling sites in 12 states, 24 have been abandoned, and are the responsibility of the .  Accidental releases from uranium mills include the 1979  in New Mexico, called the largest accident of nuclear-related waste in US history, and the 1986  in Oklahoma.\nIn 1990,  passed the  (RECA), granting  for those affected by mining, with  passed in 2000 to address criticisms with the original act.\nThe use of depleted uranium (DU) in  is controversial because of questions about potential long-term health effects. Normal functioning of the , , , , and numerous other systems can be affected by uranium exposure, because uranium is a . The aerosol produced during impact and combustion of depleted uranium munitions can potentially contaminate wide areas around the impact sites leading to possible inhalation by human beings. During a three-week period of conflict in 2003 in , 1,000 to 2,000 tonnes of DU munitions were used.\nThe actual acute and chronic toxicity of DU is also a point of medical controversy.  Multiple studies using cultured cells and laboratory rodents suggest the possibility of , , , and  effects from chronic exposure.\nA 2005  review concluded: \"In aggregate the human epidemiological evidence is consistent with increased risk of birth defects in offspring of persons exposed to DU.\" The , the directing and coordinating authority for health within the United Nations which is responsible for setting health research norms and standards, providing technical support to countries and monitoring and assessing health trends, states that no risk of reproductive, developmental, or carcinogenic effects have been reported in humans due to DU exposure. This report has been criticized by Dr. Keith Baverstock for not including possible long-term effects of DU on human body.\nMost scientific studies have found no link between uranium and birth defects, but some claim statistical correlations between soldiers exposed to DU, and those who were not, concerning reproductive abnormalities.\nOne study concluded that epidemiological evidence is consistent with an increased risk of birth defects in the offspring of persons exposed to DU. Environmental groups and others have expressed concern about the health effects of depleted uranium, and there is some debate over the matter. Some people have raised concerns about the use of this material, particularly in munitions, because of its mutagenicity, teratogenicity in mice, and neurotoxicity, and its suspected carcinogenic potential. Additional concerns address unexploded DU munitions leeching into groundwater over time.\nSeveral sources have attributed the increase in the rate of birth defects in the children of  veterans and in Iraqis to depleted uranium inhalation exposure, A 2001 study of 15,000 February 1991 U.S. Gulf War combat veterans and 15,000 control veterans found that the Gulf War veterans were 1.8 (fathers) to 2.8 (mothers) times more likely to have children with birth defects.\nIn a study of UK troops, \"Overall, the risk of any malformation among pregnancies reported by men was 50% higher in Gulf War Veterans (GWV) compared with Non-GWVs\". The conclusion of the study stated \nIt has been reported that uranium has caused  defects, and other health problems in ,  and other animals.

One method of doing this is to use a mineral () while a second method is to add a food substance such as  to the soil. This will enable bacteria to reduce the uranium (VI) to uranium (IV) which is much less soluble. In -like soils the uranium will tend to bind to the , this tends to fix the uranium in the soil.\n"},

These were the first two cities in the world to produce plutonium for use in  .\nIn the 2013 book  on a history of these two blighted cities,  (Oxford),  explores the health of affected citizens in both the United States and Russia, and the \u201cslow-motion disasters\u201d that still threaten the environments where the plants are located. According to Brown, the plants at Hanford and Mayak, over a period of four decades, \u201cboth released more than 200 million curies of radioactive isotopes into the surrounding environment -- twice the amount expelled in the  in each instance\u201d.\nMost of this  over the years at Hanford and Mayak were part of normal operations, but unforeseen accidents did occur and plant management kept this secret, as the pollution continued unabated. Even today, as pollution threats to health and the environment persist, the government keeps knowledge about the associated risks from the public.\nAbout 3.5 tons of plutonium have been released into the environment by atomic bomb tests. While this might sound like a large amount it has only resulted in a very small dose to the majority of the humans on the earth. Overall the health effects of  are far greater than the effects of the actinides released by a nuclear bomb detonation. The plutonium from the fuel of the bomb is converted into a high-fired  that is carried high into the air. It slowly falls to earth as global  and is not soluble, and as a result it is difficult for this plutonium to be incorporated into an organism if ingested. Much of this plutonium is absorbed into sediments of lakes, rivers and oceans. However, about 66% of the plutonium from a bomb explosion is formed by the neutron capture of uranium-238; this plutonium is not converted by the bomb into a high fired oxide as it is formed more slowly. This formed plutonium is more soluble and more harmful as fallout.\nSome plutonium can be deposited close to the point of detonation. The glassy  formed by the  has been examined to determine what actinides and other radioisotopes it contained. A 2006 paper reports the levels of long lived radioisotopes in the trinitite. Eu and Eu was mainly formed by the neutron activation of the  in the soil, and the level of radioactivity for these isotopes is highest where the neutron dose to the  was larger. Some of the Co was generated by activation of the  in the soil, but some was also generated by the activation of the cobalt in the  (100\u00a0foot) tower on which the bomb stood. This Co from the tower would have been scattered over the site reducing the difference in the soil levels. Ba and Am were created by the neutron activation of barium and plutonium inside the bomb. The  was present in the form of the nitrate in the chemical explosives used while the plutonium was the  fuel used.\nAs the Pu/Pu ratio only changed slightly during the Trinity detonation, it has been commented that this isotope ratio for the majority of atomic bombs (in Japan the Pu/Pu ratio in soil is normally in the range 0.17 to 0.19) is very different than from the bomb dropped upon .\nPlutonium has also been released into the environment in . In these experiments,  have been subjected to simulated accidents or detonated with an abnormal initiation of their chemical explosives. An abnormal implosion will result in a compression of the , which is less uniform and smaller than the designed compression in the device. In these experiments where no or very little  occurs, plutonium metal has been scattered around the test sites. While some of these tests have been done underground, other such tests were conducted in open air. A paper on the  left on an island by the  nuclear bombs tests of the 20th century has been printed by the  and a section of this report deals with plutonium contamination resulting from such tests.\nOther related trials were conducted at  where both normal bomb detonations and \"safety trials\" have been conducted. While the activity from the fission products has decayed away almost totally (as of 2006) the plutonium remains active.\nPlutonium can also be introduced into the environment via the reentry of artificial satellites containing . There have been several such incidents, the most prominent being the  mission. The  carried on the  re-entered the atmosphere over the South Pacific. Many atomic batteries have been of the  (RTG) type. The Plutonium-238 used in RTGs has a  of 88 years, as opposed to the plutonium-239 used in  and , which has a  of 24,100 years. In April 1964 a  failed to achieve orbit and disintegrated, dispersing roughly 1 kilogram (2.2\u00a0lb) of  over all continents. Most plutonium fell in the southern hemisphere. Estimated 6300 or 2100 man-Sv of radiation was released  and led to NASA's development of solar photovoltaic energy technology.\nChain reactions do not occur inside RTGs, so a  is impossible. In fact, some RTGs are designed so that fission does not occur at all; rather, forms of  which cannot trigger other radioactive decays are used instead. As a result, the fuel in an RTG is consumed much more slowly and much less power is produced. RTGs are still a potential source of : if the container holding the fuel leaks, the radioactive material will contaminate the environment. The main concern is that if an accident were to occur during launch or a subsequent passage of a spacecraft close to Earth, harmful material could be released into the atmosphere. However, this event is extremely unlikely with current RTG cask designs.\nIn order to minimise the risk of the radioactive material being released, the fuel is typically stored in individual modular units with their own heat shielding. They are surrounded by a layer of  metal and encased in high-strength  blocks. These two materials are corrosion and heat-resistant. Surrounding the graphite blocks is an aeroshell, designed to protect the entire assembly against the heat of reentering the Earth's atmosphere. The plutonium fuel is also stored in a ceramic form that is heat-resistant, minimising the risk of vaporization and aerosolization. The ceramic is also highly .\nThe US Department of Energy has conducted seawater tests and determined that the graphite casing, which was designed to withstand reentry, is stable and no release of plutonium should occur. Subsequent investigations have found no increase in the natural background radiation in the area.  The Apollo 13 accident represents an extreme scenario due to the high re-entry velocities  of the craft returning from cislunar space.  This accident has served to validate the design of later-generation RTGs as highly safe.\nPlutonium has been released into the environment in aqueous solution from  and  plants. The chemistry of this plutonium is different from that of the metal oxides formed from  detonations.\nOne example of a site where plutonium entered the soil is  where in the recent past  ( spectroscopy) has been used to determine the chemical nature of the plutonium in the . The XANES was used to determine the  of the plutonium, while  was used to investigate the structure of the plutonium compound present in the soil and .\nBecause plutonium oxide is very involatile, most of the plutonium in the reactor was not released during the fire. However that which was released can be measured. V.I. Yoschenko  reported that grass and forest fires can make the ,  and  become mobile in the air again.\nThe ongoing crisis at this site includes Spent Fuel Pools on the upper floors, exposed to the elements with complex MOX and plutonium products. The Japanese Government Taskforce has asked for submissions to the International Research Institute for Nuclear Decommissioning in regards to the ongoing Contaminated Water Issues.\nThere have been 18 incidences of theft or loss of  (HEU) and  confirmed by the IAEA.\nOne case exists of a  man who attempted to poison his ex-wife with plutonium stolen from WAK (Wiederaufbereitungsanlage ), a small scale reprocessing plant where he worked. He did not steal a large amount of plutonium, just rags used for wiping surfaces and a small amount of liquid waste. The man was sent to  for his crime. At least two other people were contaminated by the plutonium. Two flats in  were also contaminated. These were later cleaned at a cost of two million .\nPlutonium like other actinides readily forms a dioxide plutonyl core (PuO).  In the environment, this plutonyl core readily complexes with carbonate as well as other oxygen  (OH, NO, NO, and SO) to form charged complexes which can be readily mobile with low affinities to soil.\nPuO formed from neutralizing highly acidic nitric acid solutions tends to form polymeric PuO which is resistant to complexation.  Plutonium also readily shifts valences between the +3, +4, +5 and +6 states.  It is common for some fraction of plutonium in solution to exist in all of these states in equilibrium.\nPlutonium is known to bind to soil particles very strongly (see above for an X-ray spectroscopic study of plutonium in soil and ). While  has very different chemistry to the actinides, it is well known that both caesium and many of the actinides bind strongly to the  in soil. Hence it has been possible to use Cs labeled soil to study the migration of Pu and Cs in soils. It has been shown that  transport processes control the migration of Cs (and will control the migration of Pu) in the soil at the  according to R.D. Whicker and S.A. Ibrahim.\nMary Neu (at  in the USA) has done some work which suggests that  can accumulate plutonium because the  transport systems used by the bacteria also function as plutonium transport systems.\nPlutonium ingested by or injected into humans is transported in the  based (III) transport system and then is stored in the  in the iron store (), after an exposure to plutonium it is important to rapidly inject the subject with a  agent such as  complex of .  This antidote is useful for a single exposure such as that which would occur if a  worker were to cut his or her hand with a plutonium-contaminated object. The calcium complex has faster metal binding kinetics than the  complex but if the calcium complex is used for a long time it tends to remove important minerals from the person. The zinc complex is less able to cause these effects.\nPlutonium that is inhaled by humans lodges in the lungs and is slowly translocated to the .

Soil commonly contains an average of around 6 parts per million (ppm) of thorium. Thorium occurs in several , the most common being the rare earth-thorium-phosphate mineral, , which contains up to about 12% thorium oxide. There are substantial deposits in several countries.

The manufacture of products containing americium (such as smoke detectors) as well as nuclear reactors and explosions may also release the americium into the environment.\nIn 1999, a  transporting 900 smoke detectors in  had been reported to have caught fire; it is claimed that this led to a release of americium into the environment.

Note that exposure to  at the same time as  and radon daughters will increase the harmful effect of the radon. In  radon has been found to be more  in  than in non-smokers.\nRadon concentration in the open air varies between 1 and 100 Bq per cubic metre. Radon can be found in some  and . The towns of , , and ,  boast radium-rich springs which emit radon, as does .\nRadon exhausts naturally from the ground, particularly in certain regions, especially but not only regions with  soils. Not all granitic regions are prone to high emissions of radon, for instance while the rock which  is on is very radium rich the rock lacks the cracks required for the radon to migrate. In other nearby areas of Scotland (to the north of Aberdeen) and in / the radon is very much able to leave the rock.\nRadon is a decay product of  which in turn is a decay product of uranium. It is possible to acquire maps of average radon levels in houses to assist in the planning of radon mitigation measures for homes.\nNote that while high uranium in the / under a house does not always lead to a high radon level in air, a positive correlation between the uranium content of the soil and the radon level in air can be seen.\nRadon is related to  as it blights many homes. (See \"Radon in Houses\" below.)\nThe radon (Rn) released into the air decays to  and other radioisotopes and the levels of Pb can be measured. It is important to note that the rate of deposition of this radioisotope is very dependent on the season. Here is a graph of the deposition rate observed in .\nWell water can be very rich in radon; the use of this water inside a house is an additional route allowing radon to enter the house. The radon can enter the air and then be a source of exposure to the humans, or the water can be consumed by humans which is a different exposure route.\nRainwater can be intensely radioactive due to high levels of radon and its decay progenies Bi and Pb; the concentrations of these  can be high enough to seriously disrupt radiation monitoring at nuclear power plants. The highest levels of radon in rainwater occurs during thunderstorms, and it is hypothesized that radon is concentrated in thunderstorms on account of the atom's positive electrical charge. Estimates of the age of rain drops have been obtained from measuring the isotopic abundance of radon's short-lived decay progeny in rainwater.\nThe water, oil and gas from a well often contains . The radon decays to form solid radioisotopes which form coatings on the inside of pipework. In an oil processing plant the area of the plant where  is processed is often one of the more contaminated areas of the plant as radon has a similar boiling point to propane.\nBecause uranium minerals emit  gas, and their harmful and highly radioactive , uranium mining is considerably more dangerous than other (already dangerous) , requiring adequate ventilation systems if the mines are not . During the 1950s, a significant number of American uranium miners were  Indians, as many uranium deposits were discovered on Navajo . A statistically significant subset of these miners later developed , a type of cancer usually not associated with smoking, after exposure to uranium ore and , a natural decay product of uranium. The radon, which is produced by the uranium, and not the uranium itself has been shown to be the cancer causing agent. Some survivors and their descendants received compensation under the  in 1990.\nCurrently the level of radon in the air of mines is normally controlled by . In a working mine, the radon level can be controlled by , sealing off old workings and controlling the water in the mine. The level in a mine can go up when a mine is abandoned, it can reach a level which is able to cause the  to become  (a mild ). The radon levels in some of the mines can reach 400 to 700 kBq m.\nA common unit of exposure of lung tissue to  is the  (), this is where the human  have been exposed for 170 hours (a typical month worth of work for a miner) to air which has 3.7 kBq of Rn (in equilibrium with its decay products). This is air which has the alpha dose rate of 1  (). It is estimated that the average person () is subject to 0.2 WLM per year, which works out at about 15 to 20 WLM in a lifetime. According to the NRC 1 WLM is a 5 to 10 mSv lung dose (0.5 to 1.0 ), while the  (OECD) consider that 1 WLM is equal to a lung dose of 5.5 mSv, the  (ICRP) consider 1 WLM to be a 5 mSv lung dose for professional workers (and 4 mSv lung dose for the general public). Lastly the  (UNSCEAR) consider that the exposure of the lungs to 1 Bq of Rn (in equilibrium with its decay products) for one year will cause a dose of 61 \u03bcSv.\nIn humans a relationship between  and radon has been shown to exist (beyond all reasonable doubt) for exposures of 100 WLM and above. By using the data from several studies it has been possible to show that an increased risk can be caused by a dose as low as 15 to 20 WLM. Sadly these studies have been difficult as the random errors in the data are very large. It is likely that the miners are also subject to other effects which can harm their lungs while at work (for example dust and  fumes).\nThe fact that radon is present in indoor air has been known since at least the 1950s and research into its effects on human health started in the early 1970s. The danger of radon exposure in  received more widespread public awareness after 1984, as a result of a case of , an employee at the  in .

Nearly one in 15 homes in the U.S. has a high level of indoor radon according to their statistics. The U.S. Surgeon General and EPA recommend all homes be tested for radon. Since 1985, millions of homes have been tested for radon in the U.S.\nBy adding a crawl space under the ground floor, which is subject to forced ventilation the radon level in the house can be lowered.\n"},

Several companies mimic hypoxia using normobaric .\n is a phenomenon that occurs in aquatic environments as  (; molecular oxygen dissolved in the water) becomes reduced in concentration to a point where it becomes detrimental to aquatic organisms living in the system. Dissolved oxygen is typically expressed as a percentage of the oxygen that would dissolve in the water at the prevailing temperature and salinity (both of which affect the solubility of oxygen in water; see  and ). An aquatic system lacking dissolved oxygen (0% saturation) is termed anaerobic, , or ; a system with low concentration\u2014in the range between 1 and 30% saturation\u2014is called  or . Most fish cannot live below 30% saturation. Hypoxia leads to impaired reproduction of remaining fish via . A \"healthy\" aquatic environment should seldom experience less than 80%. The  zone is found at the boundary of anoxic and hypoxic zones.\nHypoxia can occur throughout the water column and also at high altitudes as well as near sediments on the bottom. It usually extends throughout 20-50% of the water column, but depending on the water depth and location of pycnoclines (rapid changes in water density with depth). It can occur in 10-80% of the water column. For example, in a 10-meter water column, it can reach up to 2 meters below the surface. In a 20-meter water column, it can extend up to 8 meters below the surface.\nOxygen depletion can result from a number of natural factors, but is most often a concern as a consequence of  and  in which  enter a river, lake, or ocean, and  blooms are encouraged. While phytoplankton, through , will raise DO saturation during daylight hours, the dense population of a  reduces DO saturation during the night by . When phytoplankton cells die, they sink towards the bottom and are decomposed by , a process that further reduces DO in the water column. If oxygen depletion progresses to hypoxia,  can occur and invertebrates like  and  on the bottom may be killed as well.\nHypoxia may also occur in the absence of pollutants. In estuaries, for example, because freshwater flowing from a river into the sea is less dense than salt water, stratification in the water column can result. Vertical mixing between the water bodies is therefore reduced, restricting the supply of oxygen from the surface waters to the more saline bottom waters. The oxygen concentration in the bottom layer may then become low enough for hypoxia to occur. Areas particularly prone to this include shallow waters of semi-enclosed water bodies such as the  or the , where land run-off is substantial. In these areas a so-called \"\" can be created. Low dissolved oxygen conditions are often seasonal, as is the case in  and areas of , in Washington State. The  has identified 375 hypoxic coastal zones around the world, concentrated in coastal areas in Western Europe, the Eastern and Southern coasts of the US, and East Asia, particularly in Japan.\n Hypoxia may also be the explanation for periodic phenomena such as the , where aquatic life suddenly rushes to the shallows, perhaps trying to escape oxygen-depleted water. Recent widespread shellfish kills near the coasts of Oregon and Washington are also blamed on cyclic  ecology.\nScientists have determined that high concentrations of minerals dumped into bodies of water causes significant growth of phytoplankton blooms. As these blooms are broken down by bacteria, such as , oxygen is depleted by the enzymes of these organisms.\nPhytoplankton are mostly made up of lignin and cellulose, which are broken down by enzymes present in organisms such as , known as white-rot The breakdown of cellulose does not deplete oxygen concentration in water, but the breakdown of lignin does. This breakdown of lignin includes an oxidative mechanism, and requires the presence of dissolved oxygen to take place by enzymes like ligninperoxidase. Other fungi such as brown-rot, soft-rot, and blue stain fungi also are necessary in lignin transformation. As this oxidation takes place, CO is formed in its place\nLigninperoxidase (LiP) serves as the most import enzyme because it is best at breaking down lignin in these organisms. LiP disrupts C-C bonds and C-O bonds within Lignin's three-dimensional structure, causing it to break down. LiP consists of ten alpha helices, two Ca structural ions, as well as a heme group called a tetrapyrrol ring. Oxygen serves an important role in the catalytic cycle of LiP to form a double bond on the Fe ion in the tetrapyrrol ring. Without the presence of diatomic oxygen in the water, this breakdown cannot take place because Ferrin-LiP will not be reduced into Oxyferroheme. Oxygen gas is used to reduce Ferrin-LiP into Oxyferroheme-LiP. Oxyferroheme and veratric alcohol combine to create oxygen radical and Ferri-LiP, which can now be used to degrade lignin. Oxygen radicals cannot be used in the environment, and are harmful in high presence in the environment.\nOnce Ferri-LiP is present in the ligninperoxidase, it can be used to break down lignin molecules by removing one phenylpropane group at a time through either the LRET mechanism or the mediator mechanism. The LRET mechanism (long range electron transfer mechanism) transfers an electron from the tetrapyrrol ring onto a molecule of phenylpropane in a lignin. This electron moves onto a C-C or C-O bond to break one phenylpropane molecule from the lignin, breaking it down by removing one phenylpropane at a time.\nIn the mediator mechanism, LiP enzyme is activated by the addition of hydrogen peroxide to make LiP radical, and a mediator such as veratric alcohol is added and activated creating veratric alcohol radical. Veratric alcohol radical transfers one electron to activate the phenylpropane on lignin, and the electron dismantles a C-C or C-O bond to release one phenylpropane from the lignin. As the size of a lignin molecule increases, the more difficult it is to break these C-C or C-O bonds. Three types of phenyl propane rings include coniferyl alcohol, sinapyl alcohol, and-coumaryl alcohol.\nLiP has a very low MolDock score, meaning there is little energy required to form this enzyme and stabilize it to carry out reactions. LiP has a MolDock score of -156.03 kcal/mol. This is energetically favorable due to its negative free energy requirements, and therefore this reaction catalyzed by LiP is likely to take place spontaneously. Breakdown of propanol and phenols occur naturally in the environment because they are both water-soluble.\nThe breakdown of phytoplankton in the environment depends on the presence of oxygen, and once oxygen is no longer in the bodies of water, ligninperoxidases cannot continue to break down the lignin. When oxygen is not present in the water, the breakdown of phytoplankton changes from 10.7 days to a total of 160 days for this to take place.\nThe rate of phytoplankton breakdown can be represented using this equation:\n\nIn this equation, G(t) is the amount of particulate organic carbon (POC) overall at a given time, t. G(0) is the concentration of POC before breakdown takes place. k is a rate constant in year-1, and t is time in years. For most POC of phytoplankton, the k is around 12.8 years-1, or about 28 days for nearly 96% of carbon to be broken down in these systems. Whereas for anoxic systems, POC breakdown takes 125 days, over four times longer. It takes approximately 1\u00a0mg of Oxygen to break down 1\u00a0mg of POC in the environment, and therefore, hypoxia takes place quickly as oxygen is used up quickly to digest POC. About 9% of POC in phytoplankton can be broken down in a single day at 18\u00a0\u00b0C, therefore it takes about eleven days to completely break down a full phytoplankton.\nAfter POC is broken down, this particulate matter can be turned into other dissolved organic carbon, such as carbon dioxide, bicarbonate ions, and carbonate. As much as 30% of phytoplankton can be broken down into dissolved organic carbon. When this particulate organic carbon interacts with 350\u00a0nm ultraviolet light, dissolved organic carbon is formed, removing even more oxygen from the environment in the forms of carbon dioxide, bicarbonate ions, and carbonate. Dissolved inorganic carbon is made at a rate of 2.3-6.5\u00a0mg/(m^3)day.\nAs phytoplankton breakdown, free phosphorus and nitrogen become available in the environment, which also fosters hypoxic conditions. As the breakdown of these phytoplankton takes place, the more phosphorus turns into phosphates, and nitrogens turn into nitrates. This depletes the oxygen even more so in the environment, further creating hypoxic zones in higher quantities. As more minerals such as phosphorus and nitrogen are displaced into these aquatic systems, the growth of phytoplankton greatly increases, and after their death, hypoxic zones are formed.\nTo combat hypoxia, it is essential to reduce the amount of land-derived nutrients reaching rivers in runoff. This can be done by improving sewage treatment and by reducing the amount of fertilizers leaching into the rivers. Alternately, this can be done by restoring natural environments along a river; marshes are particularly effective in reducing the amount of phosphorus and nitrogen (nutrients) in water. Other natural habitat-based solutions include restoration of shellfish populations, such as oysters.  reefs remove  from the water column and filter out suspended solids, subsequently reducing the likelihood or extent of  or anoxic conditions. Foundational work toward the idea of improving marine water quality through shellfish cultivation was conducted by Odd Lindahl et al., using mussels in Sweden. More involved than single-species shellfish cultivation,  mimics natural marine ecosystems, relying on  to improve marine water quality.\nTechnological solutions are also possible, such as that used in the redeveloped  area of the  in England, where years of runoff from sewers and roads had accumulated in the slow running waters. In 2001 a compressed air injection system was introduced, which raised the oxygen levels in the water by up to 300%. The resulting improvement in water quality led to an increase in the number of invertebrate species, such as freshwater , to more than 30.  and growth rates of fish species such as  and  also increased to such an extent that they are now amongst the highest in England.\nIn a very short time the  can drop to zero when offshore blowing winds drive surface water out and anoxic depth water rises up. At the same time a decline in temperature and a rise in salinity is observed (from the longterm ecological observatory in the  at Kiel Fjord, Germany). New approaches of long-term monitoring of oxygen regime in the ocean observe online the  of  and , which changes drastically under reduced  () and already at very low levels of .\n"},

Environmental monitoring is used in the preparation of , as well as in many circumstances in which human activities carry a risk of harmful effects on the .\nAll monitoring strategies and programs have reasons and justifications which are often designed to establish the current status of an environment or to establish trends in environmental parameters. In all cases, the results of monitoring will be reviewed, analyzed , and published. The design of a monitoring program must therefore have regard to the final use of the data before monitoring starts.\n are atmospheric substances\u2014both naturally occurring and \u2014which may potentially have a negative impact on the environment and  health. With the evolution of new chemicals and industrial processes has come the introduction or elevation of pollutants in the atmosphere, as well as environmental research and regulations, increasing the demand for air quality monitoring.\nAir quality monitoring is challenging to enact as it requires the effective integration of multiple environmental data sources, which often originate from different environmental networks and institutions. These challenges require specialized observation equipment and tools to establish air pollutant concentrations, including sensor networks,  (GIS) models, and the Sensor Observation Service (SOS), a web service for querying real-time sensor data.  that combine topographic, emissions, and meteorological data to predict air pollutant concentrations are often helpful in interpreting air monitoring data. Additionally, consideration of  data in the area between sources and the monitor often provides insights on the source of the air contaminants recorded by an air pollution monitor.\nAir quality monitors are operated by citizens, regulatory agencies, and researchers to investigate air quality and the effects of air pollution. Interpretation of ambient air monitoring data often involves a consideration of the spatial and temporal representativeness of the data gathered, and the health effects associated with exposure to the monitored levels. If the interpretation reveals concentrations of multiple chemical compounds, a unique \"chemical fingerprint\" of a particular air pollution source may emerge from analysis of the data.\nPassive or \"diffusive\" air sampling depends on meteorological conditions such as wind to diffuse air pollutants to a  medium. Passive samplers have the advantage of typically being small, quiet, and easy to deploy, and they are particularly useful in air quality studies that determine key areas for future continuous monitoring. \nAir pollution can also be assessed by  with organisms that  air pollutants, such as , mosses, fungi, and other biomass. One of the benefits of this type of sampling is how quantitative information can be obtained via measurements of accumulated compounds, representative of the environment from which they came. However, careful considerations must be made in choosing the particular organism, how it's dispersed, and relevance to the pollutant.\nOther sampling methods include the use of a , needle trap devices, and  techniques.\nSoil monitoring involves the collection and/or analysis of  and its associated , , and physical status to determine or guarantee its fitness for use. Soil faces many threats, including , ,  loss,  ,  issues, , , and . Soil monitoring helps characterize these threats and other potential risks to the soil, surrounding environments, animal health, and human health.\nAssessing these threats and other risks to soil can be challenging due to a variety of factors, including soil's  and complexity, scarcity of  data, lack of understanding of a contaminant's fate, and variability in levels of soil screening. This requires a risk assessment approach and analysis techniques that prioritize environmental protection, risk reduction, and, if necessary, remediation methods. Soil monitoring plays a significant role in that risk assessment, not only aiding in the identification of at-risk and affected areas but also in the establishment of base background values of soil.\nSoil monitoring has historically focused on more classical conditions and contaminants, including toxic elements (e.g., , , and ) and  (POPs). Historically, testing for these and other aspects of soil, however, has had its own set of challenges, as sampling in most cases is of a  in nature, requiring multiple samples over time. Additionally, procedural and analytical errors may be introduced due to variability among references and methods, particularly over time. However, as analytical techniques evolve and new knowledge about ecological processes and contaminant effects disseminate, the focus of monitoring will likely broaden over time and the quality of monitoring will continue to improve. \nThe two primary types of soil sampling are grab sampling and composite sampling. Grab sampling involves the collection of an individual sample at a specific time and place, while composite sampling involves the collection of a homogenized mixture of multiple individual samples at either a specific place over different times or multiple locations at a specific time. Soil sampling may occur both at shallow ground levels or deep in the ground, with collection methods varying by level collected from. Scoops, augers, core barrel, and solid-tube samplers, and other tools are used at shallow ground levels, whereas split-tube, solid-tube, or hydraulic methods may be used in deep ground.\nSoil contamination monitoring helps researchers identify patterns and trends in contaminant deposition, movement, and effect. Human-based pressures such as tourism, industrial activity, urban sprawl, construction work, and inadequate agriculture/forestry practices can contribute to and make worse  and lead to the soil becoming unfit for its intended use. Both inorganic and organic pollutants may make their way to the soil, having a wide variety of detrimental effects. Soil contamination monitoring is therefore important to identify risk areas, set baselines, and identify contaminated zones for remediation. Monitoring efforts may range from local farms to nationwide efforts, such as those made by China in the late 2000s, providing details such as the nature of contaminants, their quantity, effects, concentration patterns, and remediation feasibility. Monitoring and analytical equipment will ideally will have high response times, high levels of resolution and automation, and a certain degree of self-sufficiency. Chemical techniques may be used to measure toxic elements and POPs using  and , geophysical techniques may assess physical properties of large terrains, and biological techniques may use specific organisms to gauge not only contaminant level but also byproducts of contaminant biodegradation. These techniques and others are increasingly becoming more efficient, and  instrumentation is becoming more precise, resulting in more meaningful monitoring outcomes.\nSoil erosion monitoring helps researchers identify patterns and trends in soil and sediment movement. Monitoring programs have varied over the years, from long-term academic research on university plots to reconnaissance-based surveys of biogeoclimatic areas. In most methods, however, the general focus is on identifying and measuring all the dominant erosion processes in a given area. Additionally, soil erosion monitoring may attempt to quantify the effects of erosion on crop productivity, though challenging \"because of the many complexities in the relationship between soils and plants and their management under a variable climate.\"\nSoil salinity monitoring helps researchers identify patterns and trends in soil salt content. Both the natural process of  and the human-induced processes of inappropriate soil and water management can lead to salinity problems in soil, with up to one billion hectares of land affected globally (as of 2013). Salinity monitoring at the local level may look closely at the root zone to gauge salinity impact and develop management options, whereas at the regional and national level salinity monitoring may help with identifying areas at-risk and aiding policymakers in tackling the issue before it spreads. The monitoring process itself may be performed using technologies such as  and  (GIS) to identify salinity via greenness, brightness, and whiteness at the surface level. Direct analysis of soil up close, including the use of  techniques, may also be used to monitor soil salinity.\n monitoring is of little use without a clear and unambiguous definition of the reasons for the monitoring and the objectives that it will satisfy. Almost all monitoring (except perhaps ) is in some part invasive of the environment under study and extensive and poorly planned monitoring carries a risk of damage to the environment. This may be a critical consideration in wilderness areas or when monitoring very rare organisms or those that are averse to human presence. Some monitoring techniques, such as   to estimate populations, can be very damaging, at least to the local population and can also degrade public trust in scientists carrying out the monitoring.\nAlmost all mainstream environmentalism monitoring projects form part of an overall monitoring strategy or research field, and these field and strategies are themselves derived from the high levels objectives or aspirations of an organisation. Unless individual monitoring projects fit into a wider strategic framework, the results are unlikely to be published and the environmental understanding produced by the monitoring will be lost.\n\nThe range of chemical parameters that have the potential to affect any ecosystem is very large and in all monitoring programmes it is necessary to target a suite of parameters based on local knowledge and past practice for an initial review. The list can be expanded or reduced based on developing knowledge and the outcome of the initial surveys.\nFreshwater environments have been extensively studied for many years and there is a robust understanding of the interactions between chemistry and the environment across much of the world. However, as new materials are developed and new pressures come to bear, revisions to monitoring programmes will be required. In the last 20 years , synthetic  analogues, ,  and many others have required changes to monitoring strategies.\nIn ecological monitoring, the monitoring strategy and effort is directed at the plants and animals in the environment under review and is specific to each individual study.\nHowever, in more generalised environmental monitoring, many animals act as robust indicators of the quality of the environment that they are experiencing or have experienced in the recent past. One of the most familiar examples is the monitoring of numbers of  fish such as  or  in river systems and lakes to detect slow trends in adverse environmental effects. The steep decline in salmonid fish populations was one of the early indications of the problem that later became known as .\nIn recent years much more attention has been given to a more holistic approach in which the ecosystem health is assessed and used as the monitoring tool itself. It is this approach that underpins the monitoring protocols of the  in the .\n involves the measurement of  or  contamination for reasons related to the assessment or control of exposure to  or radioactive substances, and the interpretation of the results. The \u2018measurement\u2019 of dose often means the measurement of a dose equivalent quantity as a proxy (i.e. substitute) for a dose quantity that cannot be measured directly. Also, sampling may be involved as a preliminary step to measurement of the content of radionuclides in environmental media. The methodological and technical details of the design and operation of monitoring programmes and systems for different radionuclides, environmental media and types of facility are given in  Safety Guide RS\u2013G-1.8 and in IAEA Safety Report No. 64.\nRadiation monitoring is often carried out using networks of fixed and deployable sensors such as the US 's  and the  network in Japan. Airborne surveys are also made by organizations like the .\n and  are the most commonly monitored groups of microbiological organisms and even these are only of great relevance where water in the aquatic environment is subsequently used as  or where water contact recreation such as  or  is practised.\nAlthough  are the primary focus of attention, the principal monitoring effort is almost always directed at much more common indicator species such as , supplemented by overall  counts. The rationale behind this monitoring strategy is that most human pathogens originate from other humans via the  stream. Many  plants have no  final stage and therefore discharge an  which, although having a clean appearance, still contains many millions of bacteria per litre, the majority of which are relatively harmless coliform bacteria. Counting the number of harmless (or less harmful) sewage bacteria allows a judgement to be made about the probability of significant numbers of pathogenic bacteria or viruses being present. Where  or coliform levels exceed pre-set trigger values, more intensive monitoring including  for pathogenic species is then initiated.\nMonitoring strategies can produce misleading answers when relaying on counts of species or presence or absence of particular organisms if there is no regard to population size. Understanding the populations dynamics of an organism being monitored is critical.\nAs an example if presence or absence of a particular organism within a 10\u00a0km square is the measure adopted by a monitoring strategy, then a reduction of population from 10,000 per square to 10 per square will go unnoticed despite the very significant impact experienced by the organism.\nAll scientifically reliable environmental monitoring is performed in line with a published programme. The programme may include the overall objectives of the organisation, references to the specific strategies that helps deliver the objective and details of specific projects or tasks within those strategies the key feature of any programme is the listing of what is being monitored and how that monitoring is to take place and the time-scale over which it should all happen. Typically, and often as an appendix, a monitoring programme will provide a table of locations, dates and sampling methods that are proposed and which, if undertaken in full, will deliver the published monitoring programme.\nThere are a number of commercial  packages which can assist with the implementation of the programme, monitor its progress and flag up inconsistencies or omissions but none of these can provide the key building block which is the programme itself.\nGiven the multiple types and increasing volumes and importance of monitoring data, commercial  Environmental Data Management Systems (EDMS) or E-MDMS are increasingly in common use by regulated industries. They provide a means of managing all monitoring data in a single central place.  Quality validation, compliance checking, verifying all data has been received, and sending alerts are generally automated. Typical interrogation functionality enables comparison of data sets both temporarily and spatially. They will also generate regulatory and other reports.\nOne formal certification scheme exists specifically for  management software. This is provided by the  in the U.K. under its  (MCERTS).\nThere are a wide range of  methods which depend on the type of environment, the material being sampled and the subsequent analysis of the sample.\nAt its simplest a sample can be filling a clean bottle with river water and submitting it for conventional chemical analysis. At the more complex end, sample data may be produced by complex electronic sensing devices taking sub-samples over fixed or variable time periods.\nIn judgmental sampling, the selection of sampling units (i.e., the number and location and/or timing of collecting samples) is based on knowledge of the feature or condition under investigation and on professional judgment. Judgmental sampling is distinguished from probability-based sampling in that inferences are based on professional judgment, not statistical scientific theory. Therefore, conclusions about the target population are limited and depend entirely on the validity and accuracy of professional judgment; probabilistic statements about parameters are not possible. As described in subsequent chapters, expert judgment may also be used in conjunction with other sampling designs to produce effective sampling for defensible decisions.\nIn simple random sampling, particular sampling units (for example, locations and/or times) are selected using random numbers, and all possible selections of a given number of units are equally likely. For example, a simple random sample of a set of drums can be taken by numbering all the drums and randomly selecting numbers from that list or by sampling an area by using pairs of random coordinates. This method is easy to understand, and the equations for determining sample size are relatively straightforward. An example is shown in Figure 2-2. This figure illustrates a possible simple random sample for a square area of soil. Simple random sampling is most useful when the population of interest is relatively homogeneous; i.e., no major patterns of contamination or \u201chot spots\u201d are expected. The main advantages of this design are:\nIn some cases, implementation of a simple random sample can be more difficult than some other types of designs (for example, grid samples) because of the difficulty of precisely identifying random geographic locations. Additionally, simple random sampling can be more costly than other plans if difficulties in obtaining samples due to location causes an expenditure of extra effort.\nIn , the target population is separated into non-overlapping strata, or subpopulations that are known or thought to be more homogeneous (relative to the environmental medium or the contaminant), so that there tends to be less variation among sampling units in the same stratum than among sampling units in different strata. Strata may be chosen on the basis of spatial or temporal proximity of the units, or on the basis of preexisting information or professional judgment about the site or process. Advantages of this sampling design are that it has potential for achieving greater precision in estimates of the mean and variance, and that it allows computation of reliable estimates for population subgroups of special interest. Greater precision can be obtained if the measurement of interest is strongly correlated with the variable used to make the strata.\nIn systematic and grid sampling, samples are taken at regularly spaced intervals over space or time. An initial location or time is chosen at random, and then the remaining sampling locations are defined so that all locations are at regular intervals over an area (grid) or time (systematic). Examples Systematic Grid Sampling - Square Grid Systematic Grid Sampling - Triangular Grids of systematic grids include square, rectangular, triangular, or radial grids.\nCressie, 1993. In random systematic sampling, an initial sampling location (or time) is chosen at random and the remaining sampling sites are specified so that they are located according to a regular pattern. Random systematic sampling is used to search for hot spots and to infer means, percentiles, or other parameters and is also useful for estimating spatial patterns or trends over time. This design provides a practical and easy method for designating sample locations and ensures uniform coverage of a site, unit, or process.\nRanked set sampling is an innovative design that can be highly useful and cost efficient in obtaining better estimates of mean concentration levels in soil and other environmental media by explicitly incorporating the professional judgment of a field investigator or a field screening measurement method to pick specific sampling locations in the field. Ranked set sampling uses a two-phase sampling design that identifies sets of field locations, utilizes inexpensive measurements to rank locations within each set, and then selects one location from each set for sampling. In ranked set sampling, m sets (each of size r) of field locations are identified using simple random sampling. The locations are ranked independently within each set using professional judgment or inexpensive, fast, or surrogate measurements. One sampling unit from each set is then selected (based on the observed ranks) for subsequent measurement using a more accurate and reliable (hence, more expensive) method for the contaminant of interest. Relative to simple random sampling, this design results in more representative samples and so leads to more precise estimates of the population parameters. Ranked set sampling is useful when the cost of locating and ranking locations in the field is low compared to laboratory measurements. It is also appropriate when an inexpensive auxiliary variable (based on expert knowledge or measurement) is available to rank population units with respect to the variable of interest. To use this design effectively, it is important that the ranking method and analytical method are strongly correlated.\nIn adaptive , samples are taken using simple random sampling, and additional samples are taken at locations where measurements exceed some threshold value. Several additional rounds of sampling and analysis may be needed. Adaptive cluster sampling tracks the selection probabilities for later phases of sampling so that an unbiased estimate of the population mean can be calculated despite oversampling of certain areas. An example application of adaptive cluster sampling is delineating the borders of a plume of contamination. Adaptive sampling is useful for estimating or searching for rare characteristics in a population and is appropriate for inexpensive, rapid measurements. It enables delineating the boundaries of hot spots, while also using all data collected with appropriate weighting to give unbiased estimates of the population mean.\nGrab samples are samples  taken of a homogeneous material, usually , in a single vessel. Filling a clean  with  water is a very common example. Grab samples provide a good snap-shot view of the quality of the sampled environment at the point of sampling and at the time of sampling. Without additional monitoring, the results cannot be extrapolated to other times or to other parts of the river,  or ground-water.\nIn order to enable grab samples or rivers to be treated as representative, repeat transverse and longitudinal  surveys taken at different times of day and times of year are required to establish that the grab-sample location is as representative as is reasonably possible. For large rivers such surveys should also have regard to the depth of the sample and how to best manage the sampling locations at times of flood and drought.\nIn lakes grab samples are relatively simple to take using depth samplers which can be lowered to a pre-determined depth and then closed trapping a fixed volume of water from the required depth. In all but the shallowest lakes, there are major changes in the chemical composition of lake water at different depths, especially during the summer months when many lakes stratify into a warm, well oxygenated  upper layer () and a cool de-oxygenated lower layer ).\nIn the open seas marine environment grab samples can establish a wide range of base-line parameters such as salinity and a range of cation and anion concentrations. However, where changing conditions are an issue such as near river or sewage discharges, close to the effects of volcanism or close to areas of freshwater input from melting ice, a grab sample can only give a very partial answer when taken on its own.\nThere is a wide range of specialized sampling equipment available that can be programmed to take samples at fixed or variable time intervals or in response to an external trigger. For example, a sampler can be programmed to start taking samples of a river at 8-minute intervals when the rainfall intensity rises above 1\u00a0mm / hour. The trigger in this case may be a remote rain gauge communicating with the sampler by using  or  technology. Samplers can also take individual discrete samples at each sampling occasion or bulk up samples into composite so that in the course of one day, such a sampler might produce 12 composite samples each composed of 6 sub-samples taken at 20-minute intervals.\nContinuous or quasi-continuous monitoring involves having an automated analytical facility close to the environment being monitored so that results can, if required, be viewed in real time. Such systems are often established to protect important water supplies such as in the  but may also be part of an overall monitoring strategy on large strategic rivers where early warning of potential problems is essential. Such systems routinely provide data on parameters such as , , ,  and colour but it is also possible to operate  with  technologies (GLC/MS) to examine a wide range of potential  pollutants. In all examples of automated bank-side analysis there is a requirement for water to be pumped from the river into the monitoring station. Choosing a location for the pump inlet is equally as critical as deciding on the location for a river grab sample. The design of the pump and pipework also requires careful design to avoid artefacts being introduced through the action of pumping the water. Dissolved oxygen concentration is difficult to sustain through a pumped system and GLC/MS facilities can detect micro-organic contaminants from the pipework and .\nThe use of passive samplers greatly reduces the cost and the need of infrastructure on the sampling location. Passive samplers are semi-disposable and can be produced at a relatively low cost, thus they can be employed in great numbers, allowing for a better cover and more data being collected. Due to being small the passive sampler can also be hidden, and thereby lower the risk of vandalism. Examples of passive sampling devices are the  (DGT) sampler, ,  (POCIS),  (SPMDs),  (SLMDs), and an .\nAlthough on-site data collection using electronic measuring equipment is common-place, many monitoring programmes also use remote surveillance and remote access to data in real time. This requires the on-site monitoring equipment to be connected to a base station via either a telemetry network, land-line, cell phone network or other telemetry system such as Meteor burst. The advantage of remote surveillance is that many data feeds can come into a single base station for storing and analysis. It also enable trigger levels or alert levels to be set for individual monitoring sites and/or parameters so that immediate action can be initiated if a trigger level is exceeded. The use of remote surveillance also allows  for the installation of very discrete monitoring equipment which can often be buried, camouflaged or tethered at depth in a lake or river with only a short whip  protruding. Use of such equipment tends to reduce  and theft when monitoring in locations easily accessible by the public.\nEnvironmental remote sensing  uses  or  to monitor the environment using multi-channel sensors.\nThere are two kinds of remote sensing. Passive sensors detect natural radiation that is emitted or reflected by the object or surrounding area being observed. Reflected sunlight is the most common source of radiation measured by passive sensors and in environmental remote sensing, the sensors used are tuned to specific wavelengths from far  through visible light frequencies to the far . The volumes of data that can be collected are very large and require dedicated computational support. The output of data analysis from remote sensing are false colour images which differentiate  small differences in the radiation characteristics of the environment being monitored. With a skilful operator choosing specific channels it is possible to amplify differences which are imperceptible to the human eye. In particular it is possible to discriminate subtle changes in  and  concentrations in plants and show areas of an environment with slightly different nutrient regimes.\nActive remote sensing emits energy and uses a passive sensor to detect and measure the radiation that is reflected or backscattered from the target.  is often used to acquire information about the topography of an area, especially when the area is large and manual surveying would be prohibitively expensive or difficult.\nRemote sensing makes it possible to collect data on dangerous or inaccessible areas. Remote sensing applications include monitoring  in areas such as the , the effects of  on  and Arctic and Antarctic regions, and  of coastal and ocean depths.\nOrbital platforms collect and transmit data from different parts of the , which in conjunction with larger scale aerial or ground-based sensing and analysis, provides information to monitor trends such as  and other natural long and short term phenomena. Other uses include different areas of the  such as ,  and conservation.\nThe use of living organisms as monitoring tools has many advantages. Organisms living in the environment under study are constantly exposed to the  physical, biological and chemical influences of that environment. Organisms that have a tendency to  chemical species can often accumulate significant quantities of material from very low concentrations in the environment.  have been used by many investigators to monitor  concentrations because of their tendency to selectively adsorb heavy metals.\nSimilarly,  have been used to study  organic chemicals, as these are adsorbed into the fatty deposits within the eel.\nEcological sampling requires careful planning to be representative and as noninvasive as possible. For grasslands and other low growing habitats the use of a  \u2013 a 1-metre square frame \u2013 is often used with the numbers and types of organisms growing within each quadrat area counted\nSediments and  require specialist sampling tools to ensure that the material recovered is representative. Such samplers are frequently designed to recover a specified volume of material and may also be designed to recover the sediment or soil living biota as well such as the  grab sampler.\nThe interpretation of environmental data produced from a well designed monitoring programme is a large and complex topic addressed by many publications. Regrettably it is sometimes the case that scientists approach the analysis of results with a pre-conceived outcome in mind and use or misuse statistics to demonstrate that their own particular point of view is correct.\nStatistics remains a tool that is equally easy to use or to misuse to demonstrate the lessons learnt from environmental monitoring.\nSince the start of science-based environmental monitoring, a number of quality indices have been devised to help classify and clarify the meaning of the considerable volumes of data involved. Stating that a river stretch is in \"Class B\" is likely to be much more informative than stating that this river stretch has a mean BOD of 4.2, a mean dissolved oxygen of 85%, etc. In the  the  formally employed a system called General Quality Assessment (GQA) which classified rivers into six quality letter bands from A to F based on chemical criteria and on biological criteria. The Environment Agency and its devolved partners in Wales (Countryside Council for Wales, CCW) and Scotland (Scottish Environmental Protection Agency, SEPA) now employ a system of biological, chemical and physical classification for rivers and lakes that corresponds with the EU Water Framework Directive. \n\n"},

Ships are responsible for more than 18 percent of some air pollutants.\nIt also includes  emissions. The  (IMO) estimates that  emissions from  were equal to 2.2% of the global human-made emissions in 2012 and expects them to rise 50 to 250 percent by 2050 if no action is taken.\nThere is a perception that cargo transport by ship is low in air pollutants, because for equal weight and distance it is the most efficient transport method, according to shipping researcher . This is particularly true in comparison to . However, because sea shipment accounts for far more annual tonnage and the distances are often large, shipping's emissions are globally substantial. A difficulty is that the year-on-year increasing amount shipping overwhelms gains in efficiency, such as from  or the . The growth in tonne-kilometers of sea shipment has averaged 4 percent yearly since the 1990s. And it has grown by a factor of 5 since the 1970s. There are now over 100,000 transport ships at sea, of which about 6,000 are large container ships.\nThe fact that shipping enjoys substantial  privileges has contributed to the growing emissions.\n discharges by ships can have a negative impact on the .\nCruise ships, large tankers, and bulk cargo carriers use a huge amount of ballast water, which is often taken on in the coastal waters in one region after ships discharge  or unload cargo, and discharged at the next port of call, wherever more cargo is loaded. Ballast water discharge typically contains a variety of biological materials, including , , , and . These materials often include non-native, nuisance, invasive, exotic species that can cause extensive ecological and economic damage to aquatic ecosystems along with serious human health problems.\nNoise pollution caused by shipping and other human enterprises has increased in . The noise produced by ships can travel long distances, and marine species who may rely on sound for their orientation, communication, and feeding, can be harmed by this sound pollution.\nThe  has identified ocean noise as a potential threat to marine life.\nThe disruption of whales' ability to communicate with one another is an extreme threat and is affecting their ability to survive. According to Discovery Channel's article on Sonic Sea Journeys Deep into the Ocean, over the last century, extremely loud noise from commercial ships, oil and gas exploration, naval sonar exercises and other sources has transformed the ocean's delicate acoustic habitat, challenging the ability of whales and other marine life to prosper and ultimately to survive. Whales are starting to react to this in ways that are life-threatening. Kenneth C. Balcomb, a whale researcher and a former U.S Navy officer, states that the day 15 March 2000, is the day of infamy. As Discovery says, where he and his crew discovered whales swimming dangerously close to the shore. They're supposed to be in deep water.  So I pushed it back out to sea, says Balcomb. Although sonar helps to protect us, it is destroying marine life. According to IFAW Animal Rescue Program Director Katie Moore, \"There's different ways that sounds can affect animals. There's that underlying ambient noise level that's rising, and rising, and rising that interferes with communication and their movement patterns. And then there's the more acute kind of traumatic impact of sound, that's causing physical damage or a really strong behavioral response. It's fight or flight\".\n, such as whales and manatees, risk being struck by ships, causing injury and death. For example, a collision with a ship traveling at only 15  has a 79% chance of being lethal to a whale.\nOne notable example of the impact of ship collisions is the endangered , of which 400 or fewer remain. The greatest danger to the North Atlantic right whale is injury sustained from ship strikes. Between 1970 and 1999, 35.5% of recorded deaths were attributed to collisions. From 1999 to 2003, incidents of mortality and serious injury attributed to ship strikes averaged one per year. From 2004 to 2006, that number increased to 2.6. Deaths from collisions has become an extinction threat. The United States'  (NMFS) and  (NOAA) introduced  in 2008, which expired in 2013. However, in 2017 an unprecedented mortality event occurred, resulting in the deaths of 17 North Atlantic right whales caused primarily from ship-strikes and entanglement in fishing gear.\n from ships are considered to be a significant source of , both for conventional pollutants and greenhouse gases.\n from cruise ships is generated by  that burn high  content , also known as bunker oil, producing ,  and , in addition to , , and hydrocarbons.  has been classified by EPA as a likely human . EPA recognizes that these emissions from marine diesel engines contribute to  and carbon monoxide nonattainment (i.e., failure to meet  standards), as well as adverse health effects associated with ambient concentrations of particulate matter and visibility, , , and  and  of water. EPA estimates that large marine diesel engines accounted for about 1.6 percent of mobile source nitrogen oxide emissions and 2.8 percent of mobile source particulate emissions in the United States in 2000. Contributions of marine diesel engines can be higher on a port-specific basis.  (ULSD) is a standard for defining  with substantially lowered  contents.  As of 2006, almost all of the petroleum-based diesel fuel available in Europe and North America is of a ULSD type.\nIn 2016 the IMO adopted new sulfur regulations which must be implemented by larger ships beginning in January 2020.\nOf total global air emissions, shipping accounts for 18 to 30 percent of the  and 9% of the . Sulfur in the air creates  which damages crops and buildings. When inhaled, sulfur is known to cause  problems and even increases the risk of a . According to Irene Blooming, a spokeswoman for the European environmental coalition , the fuel used in oil tankers and container ships is high in sulfur and cheaper to buy compared to the fuel used for domestic land use. \"A ship lets out around 50 times more sulfur than a lorry per metric tonne of cargo carried.\" Cities in the U.S. like , , , , and  see some of the heaviest shipping traffic in the nation and have left local officials desperately trying to clean up the air. Increasing trade between the U.S. and China is helping to increase the number of vessels navigating the  and exacerbating many of the environmental problems. To maintain the level of growth China is experiencing, large amounts of  are being shipped to China by the boat load. The number of voyages are expected to continue increasing.\nOne source of environmental stresses on maritime vessels recently has come from states and localities, as they assess the contribution of commercial marine vessels to regional air quality problems when ships are docked at port. For instance, large marine diesel engines are believed to contribute 7 percent of mobile source nitrogen oxide emissions in /. Ships can also have a significant impact in areas without large commercial ports: they contribute about 37 percent of total area nitrogen oxide emissions in the  area, and that percentage is expected to increase to 61 percent by 2015. Again, there is little cruise-industry specific data on this issue. They comprise only a small fraction of the world shipping fleet, but cruise ship emissions may exert significant impacts on a local scale in specific coastal areas that are visited repeatedly. Shipboard incinerators also burn large volumes of garbage, plastics, and other , producing ash that must be disposed of. Incinerators may release toxic emissions as well.\nIn 2005,  Annex VI came into force to combat this problem. As such cruise ships now employ  monitoring on the smokestacks as well as recorded measuring via opacity meter while some are also using clean burning gas turbines for electrical loads and propulsion in sensitive areas.\nMaritime transport accounts for 3.5% to 4% of all , primarily carbon dioxide.\nAlthough the industry was not a focus of attention of the  signed in 2016, the  and the  have discussed CO emissions goals and limits. The First Intersessional Meeting of the IMO Working Group on Greenhouse Gas Emissions took place in , Norway on 23\u201327 June 2008. It was tasked with developing the technical basis for the reduction mechanisms that may form part of a future IMO regime to control greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping, and a draft of the actual reduction mechanisms themselves, for further consideration by the IMO's Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC). In 2018, the industry discussed in London placing limits to cut levels from a benchmark of 2008 carbon dioxide emissions by 50% by the year 2050. Some methods of reducing emissions of the industry include lowering speeds of shipping (which can be potentially problematic for perishable goods) as well as changes to fuel standards. In 2019, international shipping organizations, including the , proposed creating a $5 billion fund to support the research and technology necessary to cut GHG emissions.\nAnother approach to reducing the impact of  emissions from shipping was launched by vetting agency RightShip, which developed an online \"Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Rating\" as a systematic way for the industry to compare a ship's CO emissions with peer vessels of a similar size and type. Based on the International Maritime Organisation's (IMO) Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) that applies to ships built from 2013, RightShip's GHG Rating can also be applied to vessels built prior to 2013, allowing for effective vessel comparison across the world's fleet. The GHG Rating utilises an A to G scale, where A represents the most efficient ships. It measures the theoretical amount of carbon dioxide emitted per tonne nautical mile travelled, based on the design characteristics of the ship at time of build such as cargo carrying capacity, engine power and fuel consumption. Higher rated ships can deliver significantly lower CO emissions across the voyage length, which means they also use less fuel and are cheaper to run.\nMost commonly associated with ship pollution are . While less frequent than the pollution that occurs from daily operations, oil spills have devastating effects. While being toxic to marine life,  (PAHs), the components in , are very difficult to clean up, and last for years in the  and marine environment. Marine species constantly exposed to PAHs can exhibit developmental problems, susceptibility to disease, and abnormal reproductive cycles. One of the more widely known spills was the  incident in . The ship ran aground and dumped a massive amount of oil into the ocean in March 1989. Despite efforts of scientists, managers and volunteers, over 400,000 , about 1,000 , and immense numbers of fish were killed.\nThe cruise line industry dumps 255,000 US gallons (970\u00a0m) of  and 30,000 US gallons (110\u00a0m) of  into the sea every day.\nBlackwater is sewage,  from  and medical facilities, which can contain harmful , pathogens, , , and harmful nutrients. Discharges of untreated or inadequately treated sewage can cause bacterial and viral  of  and  beds, producing risks to public health. Nutrients in sewage, such as  and , promote excessive , which consumes  in the water and can lead to  and destruction of other aquatic life. A large cruise ship (3,000 passengers and crew) generates an estimated 55,000 to 110,000 liters per day of blackwater waste.\nGreywater is wastewater from the , , , , and  activities aboard a ship. It can contain a variety of pollutant substances, including , ,  and grease, , ,  , nutrients, ,  and dental waste. Sampling done by the  and the state of Alaska found that untreated greywater from cruise ships can contain pollutants at variable strengths and that it can contain levels of fecal coliform bacteria several times greater than is typically found in untreated domestic wastewater. Greywater has potential to cause adverse environmental effects because of concentrations of nutrients and other  materials, in particular. Greywater is typically the largest source of liquid waste generated by cruise ships (90 to 95 percent of the total). Estimates of greywater range from 110 to 320 liters per day per person, or 330,000 to 960,000 liters per day for a 3,000-person cruise ship.\n annex IV was brought into force September 2003 strictly limiting untreated waste discharge. Modern cruise ships are most commonly installed with a  type treatment plant for all blackwater and greywater, such as , Zenon or  bioreactors which produce near drinkable quality effluent to be re-used in the machinery spaces as technical water.\nSolid waste generated on a ship includes , , cardboard,  and  cans, and . It can be either non-hazardous or hazardous in nature. Solid waste that enters the ocean may become , and can then pose a threat to marine organisms, humans, coastal communities, and industries that utilize marine waters. Cruise ships typically manage solid waste by a combination of , , and . However, as much as 75 percent of solid waste is  on board, and the  typically is discharged at sea, although some is landed ashore for disposal or recycling. , fish, , and birds can be injured or killed from entanglement with plastics and other solid waste that may be released or disposed off of cruise ships. On average, each cruise ship passenger generates at least two pounds of non-hazardous solid waste per day. With large cruise ships carrying several thousand passengers, the amount of waste generated in a day can be massive. For a large cruise ship, about 8  of solid waste are generated during a one-week cruise. It has been estimated that 24% of the solid waste generated by vessels worldwide (by weight) comes from cruise ships. Most cruise ship garbage is treated on board (incinerated, pulped, or ground up) for discharge overboard. When garbage must be off-loaded (for example, because glass and aluminium cannot be incinerated), cruise ships can put a strain on port reception facilities, which are rarely adequate to the task of serving a large passenger vessel.\nOn a ship, oil often leaks from  and  spaces or from engine maintenance activities and mixes with water in the , the lowest part of the  of the ship. Though bilge water is filtered and cleaned before being discharged, oil in even minute concentrations can kill fish or have various  chronic effects. Bilge water also may contain solid wastes and  containing high levels of  material, oil and other chemicals. A typically large cruise ship will generate an average of 8 metric tons of oily bilge water for each 24 hours of operation. To maintain ship stability and eliminate potentially hazardous conditions from oil  in these areas, the bilge spaces need to be flushed and periodically pumped dry. However, before a bilge can be cleared out and the water discharged, the oil that has been accumulated needs to be extracted from the bilge water, after which the extracted oil can be reused, incinerated, and/or offloaded in port. If a separator, which is normally used to extract the oil, is faulty or is deliberately bypassed, untreated oily bilge water could be discharged directly into the ocean, where it can damage marine life. A number of cruise lines have been charged with  related to this issue in recent years.\nSome of the major international efforts in the form of  are the Marine Pollution Treaty, Honolulu, which deals with regulating marine pollution from ships, and the UN Convention on Law of the Sea, which deals with marine species and pollution. While plenty of local and international regulations have been introduced throughout , much of the current regulations are considered inadequate. \"In general, the treaties tend to emphasize the technical features of safety and pollution control measures without going to the root causes of sub-standard shipping, the absence of incentives for compliance and the lack of enforceability of measures.\" The most common problems encountered with international shipping arise from paperwork errors and customs brokers not having the proper information about your items. Cruise ships, for example, are exempt from regulation under the US discharge permit system (NPDES, under the Clean Water Act) that requires compliance with technology-based standards. In the , many ports lack proper  facilities, and many ships dump their waste at sea. Moreover, due to the complexities of shipping trade and the difficulties involved in regulating this business, a comprehensive and generally acceptable regulatory framework on corporate responsibility for reducing GHG emissions is unlikely to be achieved soon. In fact, emissions are continuing to increase. Under these circumstances, it is necessary for the states, the shipping industry and global organizations to explore and discuss market based mechanisms for vessel-sourced GHG emissions reduction.\nIt is expected that, (from 2004) \"...shipping traffic to and from the United States is projected to double by 2020.\" However, many shipping companies and port operators in North America (Canada and the United States) have adopted the Green Marine Environmental Program to limit operational impacts on the environment.\n"},

PPCPs include substances used by individuals for personal health or  reasons and the products used by  to boost growth or health of livestock. More than twenty million tons of PPCPs are produced every year. PPCPs have been detected in water bodies throughout the world. More research is needed to evaluate the risks of , persistence, and , but the current state of research shows that personal care products impact over the environment and other species, such as coral reefs and fish. PPCPs encompass  (EPPPs) and are one type of . They are not removed from wastewater by conventional methods. The  has declared  residues with the potential of contamination of water and soil to be \"priority substances\".\nSince the 1990s,  by pharmaceuticals has been an  of concern. Many public health professionals in the United States began writing reports of pharmaceutical contamination in waterways in the 1970s.\u201d Most pharmaceuticals are deposited in the environment through human consumption and excretion, and are often filtered ineffectively by municipal  plants which are not designed to manage them. Once in the water, they can have diverse, subtle effects on organisms, although research is still limited. Pharmaceuticals may also be deposited in the environment through improper disposal, runoff from  fertilizer and reclaimed wastewater irrigation, and leaky sewer pipes. In 2009, an investigative report by  concluded that U.S. manufacturers had legally released 271 million pounds of compounds used as drugs into the environment, 92% of which was the industrial chemicals  and , which are also used as antiseptics. It could not distinguish between drugs released by manufacturers as opposed to the . It also found that an estimated 250 million pounds of pharmaceuticals and contaminated packaging were discarded by hospitals and long-term care facilities. The series of articles led to a hearing conducted by the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Transportation Safety, Infrastructure Security, and Water Quality. This hearing was designed to address the levels of pharmaceutical contaminants in U.S. drinking water. This was the first time that pharmaceutical companies were questioned about their waste disposal methods. \"No federal regulations or laws were created as a result of the hearing.\" \"Between the years of 1970-2018 more than 3000 pharmaceutical chemicals were manufactured, but only 17 are screened or tested for in waterways.\" Alternately, \"There are no studies designed to examine the effects of pharmaceutical contaminated drinking water on human health.\u201d In parallel, the  is the second biggest consumer in the world (24% of the world total) after the USA and in the majority of EU Member States, around 50% of unused human medicinal products is not collected to be disposed of properly. In the EU, between 30 and 90% of the orally administered doses are estimated to be excreted as the active substances in the urine.\nThe term  (EPPP) was suggested in the 2010 nomination of pharmaceuticals and environment as an emerging issue to  () by the  (ISDE).\nDepending on the sources and ingredients, there are various ways in which the public can dispose of pharmaceutical and personal care products in acceptable ways. The most environmentally safe disposal method is to take advantage of a community drug take-back programs that collect drugs at a central location for proper disposal.  Several local public health departments in the United States have initiated these programs. In addition, the United States  (DEA) periodically promotes local take-back programs, as well as the .\nTake-back programs in the US are funded by state or local health departments or are volunteer programs through pharmacies or health care providers. In recent years, the proposition that pharmaceutical manufacturers should be responsible for their products \u201cfrom the cradle to the grave,\u201d has been gaining attention. Where there is no local take-back program, the  (EPA) and the  suggested in a 2009 guidance that consumers do the following:\nThe intent of the recommended practices is that the chemicals would be separated from the open environment, especially water bodies, long enough for them to naturally break down.\nWhen these substances find their way into water, it is much more difficult to deal with them. Water treatment facilities use different processes in order to minimize or fully eliminate these pollutants. This is done by using  where suspended solids are removed by .  Another method used is , and through this method microorganisms, such as  and , feed on or break down these pollutants thus eliminating them from the contaminated media.\n, or prescription and over-the-counter medications made for human use or veterinary or agribusiness purposes, are common PPCPs found in the environment. There are nine classes of pharmaceuticals included in PPCPs: , , , , , , s, , and diagnostic contrast media.\n have four classes: , , , and . These products may be found in cosmetics, perfumes, menstrual care products, lotions, shampoos, soaps, toothpastes, and sunscreen. These products typically enter the environment when passed through or washed off the body and into the ground or sewer lines, or when disposed of in the trash, septic tank, or sewage system.\nTraces of illicit drugs can be found in waterways and may even be carried by money.\nMore attention has been devoted of late to PPCPs in the environment. Two causes may contribute to this: PPCPs are actually increasing in the environment due to widespread use and/or analytical technology is better able to detect PPCPs in the environment. These substances enter the environment directly or indirectly. Direct methods include contamination of surface water by hospitals, households, industries, or  plants. Direct contamination can also affect the sediment and soil.\nIt is generally assumed (albeit hardly verified) that the production of pharmaceuticals in industrialised countries is well controlled and unharmful to the environment, due to the local legal restrictions usually required to permit production. However, a substantial fraction of the global production of pharmaceuticals takes place in low-cost production countries like India and China. Recent reports from India demonstrate that such production sites may emit very large quantities of e.g. antibiotics, yielding levels of the drugs in local surface waters higher than those found in the blood of patients under treatment.\nThe major route for pharmaceutical residues to reach the aquatic environment is most probably by excretion from patients undergoing pharma treatment. Since many pharmaceutical substances are not metabolized in the body they may be excreted in biologically active form, usually via the urine. Furthermore, many pharmaceutical substances are not fully taken up from the intestine (following oral administration in patients) into their blood stream. The fraction not taken up into the blood stream will remain in the gut and eventually be excreted via the faeces. Hence, both urine and faeces from treated patients contain pharmaceutical residues. Between 30 and 90% of the orally administered dose is generally excreted as active substance in the urine.\nAn additional source to environmental pollution with pharmaceuticals is improper disposal of unused or expired drug residues. In European countries take-back systems for such residues are usually in place (although not always utilized to full extent) while in e.g. the US only voluntary initiatives on a local basis exist. Though most of the waste goes to incineration and people are asked to throw unused or expired pharmaceuticals into the household waste investigations in Germany showed that up to 24% of liquid pharmaceuticals and 7% of tablets or ointments are disposed always or at least \u201crarely\u201d via the toilet or sink.\nProper destruction of pharma residues should yield rest products without any pharmaceutical or ecotoxic activity. Furthermore, the residues should not act as components in the environmental formation of new such products. Incineration at a high temperature (>1000 degrees Celsius) is considered to fulfill the requirements, but even following such incineration residual ashes from the incineration should be properly taken care of.\nPharmaceuticals used in veterinary medicine, or as additives to animal food, pose a different problem, since they are excreted into soil or possibly open surface waters. It is well known that such excretions may affect terrestrial organisms directly, leading to extinction of exposed species (e.g. dung-beetles). Lipid-soluble pharma residues from veterinary use may bind strongly to soil particles, with little tendency to leak out to ground water or to local surface waters. More water-soluble residues may be washed out with rain or melting snow and reach both ground water and surface water streams.\nThe use of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) is on the rise with an estimated increase from 2\u00a0billion to 3.9\u00a0billion annual prescriptions between 1999 and 2009 in the United States alone. PPCPs enter into the environment through individual human activity and as residues from manufacturing, agribusiness,  use, and  and community use. In Europe, the input of pharmaceutical residues via domestic waste water is estimated to be around 80% whereas 20% is coming from hospitals. Individuals may add PPCPs to the environment through waste excretion and bathing as well as by directly disposing of unused medications to , , or trash.  Because PPCPs tend to dissolve relatively easily and do not evaporate at normal temperatures, they often end up in soil and water bodies.\nSome PPCPs are broken down or processed easily by a human or animal body and/or degrade quickly in the environment . However, others do not break down or degrade easily. The likelihood or ease with which an individual substance will break down depends on its chemical makeup and the metabolic pathway of the compound.\nA 2002 study by the  found detectable quantities of one or more chemicals in 80 percent of a sampling of 139 susceptible streams in 30 states. The most common pharmaceuticals detected were  nonprescription drugs; , , , natural and synthetic , and an assortment of  and  were also found.\nA 2006 study found detectable concentrations of 28 pharmaceutical compounds in sewage treatment plant effluents, surface water, and sediment. The therapeutic classes included ,  and anti-inflammatories,  regulators, , , and . Although most chemical concentrations were detected at low levels (nano-grams/Liter (ng/L)), there are uncertainties that remain regarding the levels at which toxicity occurs and the risks of  of these pharmaceutical compounds.\nA study published in late 2014 reported a spike in the levels of , ,  and  in nearby rivers coinciding with a Taiwanese youth event attended by around 600,000 people. In 2018, shellfish in Puget Sound, waters that receive treated sewage from the Seattle area, tested positive for .\nBesides the identified input from human medicine there appears diffuse pollution for example from pharmaceuticals used in agriculture, too. Investigations in ,  and  showed traces of PPCPs upstream of waste water treatment plant effluents to rivers, too.\nThe scope of human exposure to pharmaceuticals and personal care products from the environment is a complex function of many factors. These factors include the concentrations, types, and distribution of pharmaceuticals in the environment; the pharmacokinetics of each drug; the structural transformation of the chemical compounds either through metabolism or natural degradation processes; and the potential bioaccumulation of the drugs. More research is needed to determine the effects on humans of long-term exposure to low levels of PPCPs.  The full effects of mixtures of low concentrations of different PPCPs is also unknown.\n\"The U.S. EPA risk assessment states that the acceptable daily intake (ADI) of pharmaceuticals is around 0.0027 mg/kg\u2010day.\" Due to the lack of research of toxicity guidelines and their effects on human health it is difficult to determine a healthy dosage for water contaminated by pharmaceuticals. \"The pharmaceutical sample size tested does not give a full representation of human exposure. Only 17 out of 3000 prescriptions are screened for in drinking water.\"\nIn addition, \u201cThe EPA and FDA regulations state that a drug or chemical is not considered harmful until clear evidence shows that  a substance causes harm\". This means that we are not testing or screening for thousands of contaminants in our drinking water. Health risk assessments have not been conducted to provide concrete evidence to link pharmaceutical contamination and adverse human health effects.\n\"However adverse health outcomes are displayed in aquatic organisms. Fish living near water treatment plants have been reported to be feminized.\" \"Some male fish started to develop ovaries and other feminized characteristic due to pharmaceutical pollution some species have decreased in population due to exposure of EE2 and other hormonal ECD substances.\"\nAlthough research has shown that PPCPs are present in water bodies throughout the world, no studies have shown a direct effect on human health. However, the absence of empirical data cannot rule out the possibility of adverse outcomes due to interactions or long-term exposures to these substances. Because the amounts of these chemicals in the water supply may be in the parts per trillion or parts per billion, it is difficult to chemically determine the exact amounts present. Many studies have therefore been focused to determining if the concentrations of these pharmaceuticals exist at or above the accepted daily intake (ADI) at which the designed biological outcomes can occur.\nIn addition to the growing concerns about human health risks from pharmaceutical drugs via environmental exposures, many researchers have speculated about the potential for inducing an antibiotic resistance. One study found 10 different antibiotics in sewage treatment effluents, surface water, and sediments. Some microbiologists believe that if antibiotic concentrations are higher than the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of a species of pathogenic bacteria, a selective pressure would be exerted and, as a result, antibiotic resistance would be selectively promoted. It has also been proven that at even sub-inhibitory concentrations (e.g., one-fourth of the MIC), several antibiotics are able to have an effect on gene expression (e.g., as shown for the modulation of expression of toxin-encoding genes in Staphylococcus aureus).\nFor reference the MIC of erythromycin that is effective against 90 percent of lab grown Campylobacter bacteria, the most common food-borne pathogen in the United States, is 60\u00a0ng/mL. One study found that the average concentration of erythromycin, a commonly prescribed antibiotic, was 0.09\u00a0ng/mL in water treatment plant effluents,. Additionally, transfer of genetic elements among bacteria has been observed under natural conditions in  plants, and selection of resistant bacteria has been documented in sewers receiving wastewaters from pharmaceutical plants. Moreover, antibiotic resistant bacteria may also remain in sewage sludge and enter the food chain if the sludge is not incinerated but used as fertilizer on agricultural land.\nThe relationship between risk perception and behavior is multifaceted.  Risk management is most effective once the motivation behind the behavior of disposing unused pharmaceuticals is understood.  There was little correlation found between the perception of risk and knowledge regarding pharmaceutical waste according to a study conducted by Cook and Bellis in 2001.  This study cautioned against the effectiveness of attempting to change the public\u2019s behavior on these health issues by warning them of the risks associated with their actions.\nIt is advised to take careful measures to inform the public in a way that does not impart guilt but rather public awareness.  For example, a study carried out by Norlund and Garvill in Sweden (2003)  that found that some people may make a personal sacrifice in terms of comfort because they feel that it would be helpful to reduce further environmental damage caused by the use of cars.  Awareness of air pollution problems was a factor in their decision to take action on a more environmentally favorable choice of transportation.  Thus, the goal of Bound\u2019s project encapsulates whether the perception of risk associated with pharmaceuticals has an effect on the way in which medication is commonly disposed.\nIn order to conduct this study, the pharmaceuticals were grouped by their therapeutic action in order to help participants identify them.  The eight therapeutic groups are listed below: , , , ,  treatments, and  regulators.  Next, a survey was created to examine the disposal patterns of the participants and their perception of the existing risk or threat against the environment.  Respondents were asked the following questions in part one of the survey: 1. When and how they disposed of pharmaceuticals. 2. How they perceive the risk to the environment posed by pharmaceuticals. 3. To differentiate between the risks associated with different classed of pharmaceuticals.  Part two of the survey involved each of the eight pharmaceutical groups described above individually. Finally, the third part asked information about the age, sex, profession, postcode, and education of participants.  The sample size of participants was precise in comparison to the actual distribution of males and females in the UK: Sample- 54.8 percent were female and 45.2 percent male vs. Actual- the UK of 51.3 percent female to 48.7 percent male.  Results showed that when a medication must be discarded, 63.2 percent of participants throw them in a bin, 21.8 percent return them to a pharmacist, and 11.5 percent dispose of them via the toilet/sink, while the remaining 3.5 percent keep them.  Only half of the respondents felt like pharmaceuticals could potentially be harmful to the environment.  Upon examination of factors relevant to risk perception, there was no definite link found between perception and education or income.\nDr. Bound noted that participation in altruistic activities such as Environmental Conservation groups may provide members with the ability to better grasp the effects of their actions in the environment.  In regards to the aquatic environment, it is hard for one to perceive the favorable effects of properly disposing medication.  There also exists the plausibility that a person\u2019s behavior will only be affected if there is a severe risk to themselves or humans as opposed to an environmental threat.  Even though there are serious threats of pharmaceutical pollution resulting in the feminization of certain fish, they have a lower priority because they are not easily understood or experienced by the general public.  In Jonathan P. Bound\u2019s opinion, the provision of information about exactly how to go about disposing unused medication properly in conjunction with risk education may have a more positive and forceful effect.\n\nSeveral recommendations and initiatives have been made to prevent pharmaceutical pollution in the environment.  Important practices include: \nFirst, it is imperative that patients become educated on pharmaceutical pollution and its hazardous effects on humans, animals, and the overall environment.  By educating patients on proper disposal of unused drugs, steps are being taken to further prevent pharmaceutical waste in the environment.  Consumers should take precautions before tossing out drugs in the trash or flushing them down the toilet.  Community take-back programs have been set up for consumers to bring back unused drugs for proper disposal.  Another initiative is for pharmacies to serve as a take-back site for proper drug disposal such as implementing recycling bins for customers to bring back unused or expired medicines while they\u2019re shopping. In addition, medical foundations could receive these medicines to administer them to people who need them, while destroying those that are in excess or expired. Furthermore, educating physicians and patients on the importance of proper drug disposal and the environmental concern will help further reduce pharmaceutical waste.\nAlso, implementing initiatives for hospitals to focus on better practices for hazardous waste disposal may prove to be beneficial.  The US EPA encourages hospitals to develop efficient pharmaceutical disposal practices by giving them grants.  This incentive may be very beneficial to other hospitals worldwide.\nAdditionally, \u201cIt is critical for us to develop an analytical method of identifying, testing, and regulating the amount of pharmaceuticals in the water systems\u201d. Data must be collected in order to accurately measure the prevalence of pharmaceuticals in drinking water. \u201cMultiple Health risk assessments should be conducted to understand the effects of prolonged exposure to pharmaceuticals in drinking water\u201d.\nCommunity-based programs should be developed to monitor exposure and health outcomes.  We should encourage the pharmaceutical industry to develop technology that extracts pharmaceuticals from waterways. \u201cExtensive research must be conducted to determine the amount of pharmaceutical contamination in the environment and its effects on  animals and marine life\u201d.\nWe must remember that many pharmaceuticals pass through the human body unchanged, so it is best for human excrement to not go into waterways, even after conventional treatment, which can also not remove these chemicals. It is therefore preferable for human feces and urine to go into fertile soil, where they will receive more effective treatment by numerous microbes found there, over longer amounts of time, and stay away from waterways, via the use of s, s, and s. As mentioned below,  are efficient at removing these chemicals, but it is better for them to not go into water in the first place.\nWhile the full effects of most PPCPs on the environment are not understood, there is concern about the potential they have for harm because they may act unpredictably when mixed with other chemicals from the environment or concentrate in the food chain. Additionally, some PPCPs are active at very low concentrations, and are often released continuously in large or widespread quantities.\nBecause of the high solubility of most PPCPs, aquatic organisms are especially vulnerable to their effects.  Researchers have found that a class of antidepressants may be found in frogs and can significantly slow their development.  The increased presence of estrogen and other synthetic hormones in waste water due to birth control and hormonal therapies has been linked to increased feminization of exposed fish and other aquatic organisms. The chemicals within these PPCP products could either affect the feminization or masculinization of different fishes, therefore affecting their reproductive rates.\nIn addition to being found only in waterways, the ingredients of some PPCPs can also be found in the soil. Since some of these substances take a long time or cannot be degraded biologically, they make their way up the food chain. Information pertaining to the transport and fate of these hormones and their metabolites in dairy waste disposal is still being investigated, yet research suggest that the land application of solid wastes is likely linked with more hormone contamination problems. Not only does the pollution from PPCPs affect marine ecosystems, but also those habitats that depend on this polluted water.\nThere are various concerns about the effects of pharmaceuticals found in surface waters and specifically the threats against rainbow trout exposed to treated sewage effluents.  Analysis of these pharmaceuticals in the blood plasma of fish compared to human therapeutic plasma levels have yielded vital information providing a means of assessing risk associated with medication waste in water.  In a study by Dr. Jerker Fick from  rainbow trout were exposed to undiluted, treated sewage water at three different sits in Sweden.  They were exposed for a total of 14 days while 25 pharmaceuticals were measured in the blood plasma at different levels for analysis.  The  Levonorgestrel was detected in fish blood plasma at concentrations between 8.5 and 12\u00a0ng mL-1 which exceed the human therapeutic plasma level.  Studies show that the measured effluent level of Levonorgestrel in the three areas was shown to reduce the fertility of the rainbow trout.\nThe three sites chosen for field exposures were in located in Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Ume\u00e5.  They were chosen according to their varying degrees of treatment technologies, geographic locations, and size.  The effluent treatment includes active sludge treatment, nitrogen and phosphorus removal (except in Ume\u00e5), primary clarification, and secondary clarification.  Juvenile rainbow trout were procured from Antens fiskodling AB, Sweden and Umlax AB, Sweden.  The fish were exposed to aerated, undiluted, treated effluent.  Since all of the sites underwent sludge treatment, it can be inferred that they are not representative of the low end of treatment efficacy. Of the 21 pharmaceuticals that were detected in the water samples, 18 were identified in the effluent, 17 in the plasma portion, and 14 pharmaceuticals were found in both effluent and plasma.\nStarting in the mid-1960s, ecologists and toxicologists began to express concern about the potential adverse effects of pharmaceuticals in the water supply, but it wasn\u2019t until a decade later that the presence of pharmaceuticals in water was well documented. Studies in 1975 and 1977 found  and  at trace concentrations in treated water. Widespread concern about and research into the effect of  largely started in the early 1990s.  Until this time, PPCPs were largely ignored because of their relative solubility and containment in waterways compared to more familiar pollutants like , industrial chemicals, and  and byproducts.\nSince then, a great deal of attention has been directed to the ecological and physiological risk associated with pharmaceutical compounds and their metabolites in water and the environment. In the last decade, most research in this area has focused on  and antibiotics. There is concern that steroid hormones may act as . Some research suggests that concentrations of , an estrogen used in oral contraceptive medications and one of the most commonly prescribed pharmaceuticals, can cause endocrine disruption in aquatic and amphibian wildlife in concentrations as low as 1\u00a0ng/L.\nCurrent research on PPCPs aims to answer these questions:\nPharmacoenvironmentology is an extension of pharmacovigilance as it deals specifically with the environmental and ecological effects of drugs given at therapeutic doses. Pharmacologists with this particular expertise (known as a pharmacoenvironmentologist) become a necessary component of any team assessing different aspects of drug safety in the environment. We must look at the effects of drugs not only in medical practice, but also at its environmental effects. Any good clinical trial should look at the impact of particular drugs on the environment. Things we need to address in pharmacoenvironmentology are drugs and their exact concentration in different parts of the environment.\nPharmacoenvironmentology is a specific domain of pharmacology and not of environmental studies. This is because it deals with drugs entering through living organisms through elimination.\nPharmacovigilance is a new branch of science, which was born in 1960 after the incidence of the thalidomide disaster. Thalidomide is a teratogen and caused horrific birth abnormalities. The thalidomide disaster lead to the present day approach to drug safety and adverse event reporting.\nAccording to the EPA, pharamacovigilance is science aiming to capture any adverse effects of pharmaceuticals in humans after use. However, ecopharmacovigilance is  the science, and activities concerning detection, assessment, understanding, and prevention of adverse effects of pharmaceuticals in the environment which affect humans and other animal species. There has been a growing focus among scientists about the impact of drugs on the environment.  In recent years, we have been able to see human pharmaceuticals that are being detected in the environment which most are typically found on surface water.\nThe importance of ecopharmacovigilance is to monitor adverse effects of pharmaceuticals on humans through environmental exposure. Due to this relatively new field of science, researchers are continuously developing and understanding the impacts of pharmaceuticals in the environment and its risk on human and animal exposure. Environmental risk assessment is a regulatory requirement in the launch of any new drug.  This precaution has become a necessary step towards the understanding and prevention of adverse effects of pharmaceutical residue in the environment.  It is important to note that pharmaceuticals enter the environment from the excretion of drugs after human use, hospitals, and improper disposal of unused drugs from patients.\nEcopharmacology concerns the entry of chemicals or drugs into the environment through any route and at any concentration disturbing the balance of ecology (ecosystem), as a consequence. Ecopharmacology is a broad term that includes studies of \u201cPPCPs\u201d irrespective of doses and route of entry into environment.\nThe geology of a karst aquifer area assists with the movement of PPCPs from the surface to the ground water. Relatively soluble bedrock creates sinkholes, caves and sinking streams into which surface water easily flows, with minimal filtering.  Since 25% of the population get their drinking water from karst aquifers, this affects a large number of people.  A 2016 study of karst aquifers in southwest Illinois found that 89% of water samples had one or more PPCP measured. Triclocarban (an antimicrobial) was the most frequently detected PPCP, with gemfibrozil (a cardiovascular drug) the second most frequently detected.  Other PPCPs detected were trimethoprim, naproxen, carbamazepine, caffeine, sulfamethoxazole, and fluoxetine. The data suggests that septic tank effluent is a probable source of PPCPs.\n (STP) work with physical, chemical, and biological processes to remove  and contaminants from waste water. Usually the STP is equipped with an initial mechanical separation of solid particles (cotton buds, cloth, hygiene articles etc.) appearing in the incoming water. Following this there may be filters separating finer particles either occurring in the incoming water or developing as a consequence of chemical treatment of the water with flocculating agents.\nMany STPs also include one or several steps of biological treatment. By stimulating the activity of various strains of microorganisms physically their activity may be promoted to degrade the organic content of the sewage by up to 90% or more. In certain cases more advanced techniques are used as well. The today most commonly used advanced treatment steps especially in terms of micropollutants are\nPPCPs are difficult to remove from wastewater with conventional methods. Some research shows the concentration of such substances is even higher in water leaving the plant than water entering the plant. Many factors including environmental pH, seasonal variation, and biological properties affect the ability of a STP to remove PPCPs.\nA 2013 study of a drinking water treatment plant, found that of 30 PPCPs measured at both the source water and the drinking water locations, 76% of PPCPs were removed, on average, in the water treatment plant. Ozonation was found to be an efficient treatment process for the removal of many PPCPs.  However, there are some PPCPs that were not removed, such as DEET used as mosquito spray, nonylphenol which is a surfactant used in detergents, the antibiotic erythromycin, and the herbicide atrazine.\nSeveral research projects are running to optimize the use of advanced sewage treatment techniques under different conditions. The advanced techniques will increase the costs for the sewage treatment substantially.\nIn a European cooperation project between 2008 and 2012 in comparison 4 hospital waste water treatment facilities were developed in , ,  and  to investigate the elimination rates of concentrated waste water with pharmaceutical \u201ccocktails\u201d by using different and combined advanced treatment technologies. Especially the German STP at Marienhospital  showed the effects of a combination of membranes, ozone, powdered activated carbon and sand filtration. But even a maximum of installed technologies could not eliminate 100% of all substances and especially  are nearly impossible to eliminate. The investigations showed that depending on the installed technologies the treatment costs for such a hospital treatment facility may be up to 5.50 \u20ac per m. Other studies and comparisons expect the treatment costs to increase up to 10%, mainly due to energy demand. It is therefore important to define best available technique before extensive infrastructure investments are introduced on a wide basis.\nThe fate of incoming pharmaceutical residues in the STP is unpredictable. Some substances seem to be more or less completely eliminated, while others pass the different steps in the STP unaffected. There is no systematic knowledge at hand to predict how and why this happens.\nPharmaceutical residues that have been conjugated (bound to a bile acid) before being excreted from the patients may undergo de-conjugation in the STP, yielding higher levels of free pharmaceutical substance in the outlet from the STP than in its incoming water. Some pharmaceuticals with large sales volumes have not been detected in the incoming water to the STP, indicating that complete metabolism and degradation must have occurred already in the patient or during the transport of sewage from the household to the STP.\nIn the United States, EPA has published wastewater regulations for pharmaceutical manufacturing plants. \nEPA has also issued air pollution regulations for manufacturing facilities.\nEPA published regulations for hazardous waste disposal of pharmaceuticals by health care facilities in 2019. The agency also studied disposal practices for health care facilities where unused pharmaceuticals might be flushed rather than placed in solid waste, but did not develop wastewater regulations\n\nThere are no national regulations covering disposal by consumers to sewage treatment plants (i.e., disposed down the drain). To address pharmaceuticals that may be present in drinking water, in 2009 EPA added three birth control substances and one antibiotic to its  (CCL 3) for possible regulation under the .\nIn 2019, the  banned coral damaging sunscreens, in a growing trend to try to protect .\n80% of pills in the world are packed with , which is the most convenient type for several reasons. Blister packs have two main components, the \u201clid\u201d and the \u201cblister\u201d (cavity). Lid is mainly manufactured with  (Al) and . The Cavity consists of  (PVC),  (PP),  (PET) or aluminum (Al). If users employ proper disposal methods, all these materials can be  and the harmful effects to the  can be minimized. However, a problem arises with the improper disposal either by burning or disposing as normal household waste.\nBurning of blister packs directly causes  by the  products of polypropylene ([CH]), polyester ([CHO]), and polyvinyl chloride ([CHCHCl]). The combustion reactions and products of these chemicals are mentioned below.\n[CH] + 9n/2 O \u2192 3n CO +3n HO\n[CHO] + 10n O \u2192 10n CO +4n HO\n[CHCHCl] + 2n O \u2192 n CO + n HO + n HCl + n CO\nEven though polypropylene and polyester is harmful to the environment, the most  is due to the combustion of polyvinyl chloride since it produces  (HCl) which is an irritant in the lower and upper  that can cause adverse effects to human beings.\nThe disposal of blister packs as normal waste, will forbid recycling process and eventually accumulate in  or water, which will result  and  since  processes of compounds like PVC, PP and PET are very slow. As a result,  damaging effects like disturbances of the  and movements can be seen.  by the animals, affect the secretion of  and   that can decrease the feeding  and may also cause problems in . At low , aluminum can increase its  according to the following equation. As a result, the negative effects of both  and  can be generated.\n2Al+ 6H \u2192 2Al  + 3H \nBy employing proper disposal methods, all manufacturing materials of blister packs like PP, PE, PVC and Al can be recycled and the adverse effects to the environment can be minimized. Even though, the synthesis of these  relatively simple, the recycling process can be very complex since the blister packs contain s and polymers together.\nAs the first step of recycling, separation of Al and Polymers using the  method which uses hydrochloric acid (HCl)  can be incorporated. Then PVC can be recycled by using mechanical or chemical methods. The most recent trend is to use ,  \u201cbio plastics\u201d which are also called as  such as derivatives of , , ,  and  for pharmaceutical packaging, to reduce the hostile effects to the environment.\n has the ability to enter bodies of water and soil after entering landfills or by precipitation, such as rain or snow. However, due to 's high volatility, most of it that enters the bodies of water and soil will evaporate again and re-enter the atmosphere. Not all of the acetone molecules will evaporate again, and so, when acetone remains in the bodies of water or soil, a reaction will occur. Nail polish remover evaporates easily because acetone's intermolecular forces are weak. An acetone molecule can't attract other acetone molecules easily because its hydrogens are not slightly positive. The only force that holds acetone molecules together is its permanent dipoles which are weaker than hydrogen bonds.\nSince nail polish remover is a solvent, it will dissolve in water. When acetone dissolves in water, it hydrogen bonds with water. The more nail polish remover that enters the hydrosphere will increase the concentration of acetone and then increase the concentration of the solution created when acetone and water bonds. If enough nail polish remover is disposed, it can reach the lethal dose level for aquatic life.\nNail polish remover can also enter the lithosphere by landfills and by precipitation. However, it will not bind to the soil. Microorganisms in the soil will decompose acetone. The consequence of microorganisms decomposing acetone is the risk it has to cause oxygen depletion in bodies of water. The more acetone readily available for microorganism decomposition leads to more microorganisms reproduced and thus oxygen depletion because more microorganisms use up the available oxygen.\nWhen nail polish remover evaporates, acetone enters the atmosphere in the gaseous phase. In the gaseous phase, acetone can undergo photolysis and breakdown into carbon monoxide, methane, and ethane. When temperatures are between 100 - 350 degrees Celsius, the following mechanism occurs:\n(CH)2CO + hv \u2192 CH + CHCO\nCHCO \u2192 CH+ CO\nCH+ (CH)2CO \u2192 CH4 + CH2COCH\n2CH \u2192 C2H6\nA second pathway that nail polish remover can enter in the atmosphere is reacting with hydroxyl radicals. When acetone reacts with hydroxyl radicals, its main product is methylglyoxal.  is an organic compound that is a by-product of many metabolic pathways. It is an intermediate precursor for many , that are formed for diseases such as diabetes or neurodegenerative diseases.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorofluorocarbon", "title": "ChlorofluorocarbonWikipedia", "body": " () and  () are fully or partly halogenated  hydrocarbons that contain only  (C),  (H),  (Cl), and  (F), produced as  derivative of , , and . They are also commonly known by the  brand name .\nThe most common representative is  (R-12 or Freon-12). Many CFCs have been widely used as , propellants (in aerosol applications), and solvents. Because CFCs contribute to  in the upper , the manufacture of such compounds has been phased out under the , and they are being replaced with other products such as  (HFCs) including  and .\nAs in simpler , carbon in the CFCs bonds with  symmetry. Because the fluorine and chlorine atoms differ greatly in size and effective charge from hydrogen and from each other, the methane-derived CFCs deviate from perfect tetrahedral symmetry.\nThe physical properties of CFCs and HCFCs are tunable by changes in the number and identity of the  atoms. In general, they are volatile but less so than their parent alkanes. The decreased volatility is attributed to the molecular polarity induced by the , which induces intermolecular interactions. Thus, methane boils at \u2212161\u00a0\u00b0C whereas the fluoromethanes boil between \u221251.7 (CFH) and \u2212128\u00a0\u00b0C (CF). The CFCs have still higher boiling points because the chloride is even more polarizable than fluoride. Because of their polarity, the CFCs are useful solvents, and their boiling points make them suitable as refrigerants. The CFCs are far less flammable than methane, in part because they contain fewer C-H bonds and in part because, in the case of the chlorides and bromides, the released halides quench the free radicals that sustain flames.\nThe densities of CFCs are higher than their corresponding alkanes. In general, the density of these compounds correlates with the number of chlorides.\nCFCs and HCFCs are usually produced by halogen exchange starting from chlorinated methanes and ethanes. Illustrative is the synthesis of chlorodifluoromethane from :\nBrominated derivatives are generated by free-radical reactions of hydrochlorofluorocarbons, replacing C-H bonds with C-Br bonds. The production of the   (\"halothane\") is illustrative:\nCFCs and HCFCs are used in a variety of applications because of their low toxicity, reactivity and flammability. Every permutation of fluorine, chlorine and hydrogen based on methane and ethane has been examined and most have been commercialized. Furthermore, many examples are known for higher numbers of carbon as well as related compounds containing bromine. Uses include , , propellants in medicinal applications and degreasing solvents.\nBillions of kilograms of chlorodifluoromethane are produced annually as a precursor to , the monomer that is converted into .\nA special numbering system is to be used for fluorinated alkanes, prefixed with Freon-, R-, CFC- and HCFC-, where the rightmost value indicates the number of fluorine atoms, the next value to the left is the number of hydrogen atoms  1, and the next value to the left is the number of carbon atoms  one (zeroes are not stated), and the remaining atoms are .\nFreon-12, for example, indicates a methane derivative (only two numbers) containing two fluorine atoms (the second 2) and no hydrogen (1-1=0). It is therefore CClF.\nAnother equation that can be applied to get the correct molecular formula of the CFC/R/Freon class compounds is this to take the numbering and add 90 to it. The resulting value will give the number of carbons as the first numeral, the second numeral gives the number of hydrogen atoms, and the third numeral gives the number of fluorine atoms. The rest of the unaccounted carbon bonds are occupied by chlorine atoms. The value of this equation is always a three figure number. An easy example is that of CFC-12, which gives: 90+12=102 -> 1 carbon, 0 hydrogens, 2 fluorine atoms, and hence 2 chlorine atoms resulting in CClF. The main advantage of this method of deducing the molecular composition in comparison with the method described in the paragraph above is that it gives the number of carbon atoms of the molecule.\n containing bromine are signified by four numbers. , which are common for ethane and propane derivatives, are indicated by letters following the numbers\u00a0:\nThe most important reaction of the CFCs is the  of a C-Cl bond:\nThe chlorine atom, written often as Cl, behaves very differently from the chlorine molecule (Cl). The radical Cl is long-lived in the upper atmosphere, where it catalyzes the conversion of ozone into O. Ozone absorbs UV-B radiation, so its depletion allows more of this high energy radiation to reach the Earth's surface.  atoms are even more efficient catalysts; hence brominated CFCs are also regulated.\nCFCs were phased out via the  due to their part in .\nHowever, the atmospheric impacts of CFCs are not limited to their role as ozone-depleting chemicals. Infrared absorption bands prevent heat at that wavelength from escaping earth's atmosphere. CFCs have their strongest absorption bands from C-F and C-Cl bonds in the spectral region of 7.8\u201315.3 \u2014referred to as  due to the relative transparency of the atmosphere within this region.\nThe strength of CFC absorption bands and the unique susceptibility of the atmosphere at wavelengths where CFCs (indeed all covalent fluorine compounds) absorb creates a \u201csuper\u201d greenhouse effect from CFCs and other unreactive fluorine-containing gases such as , , , , , and . This \u201catmospheric window\u201d absorption is intensified by the low concentration of each individual CFC. Because CO is close to saturation with high concentrations and few infrared absorption bands, the radiation budget and hence the greenhouse effect has low sensitivity to changes in CO concentration; the increase in temperature is roughly logarithmic. Conversely, the low concentration of CFCs allow their effects to increase linearly with mass, so that chlorofluorocarbons are  with a much higher potential to enhance the greenhouse effect than CO.\nGroups are actively disposing of legacy CFCs to reduce their impact on the atmosphere.\nAccording to  in 2018, the hole in the ozone layer has begun to recover as a result of CFC bans.\n (CCl) was used in fire extinguishers and glass \"anti-fire grenades\" from the late nineteenth century until around the end of . Experimentation with chloroalkanes for fire suppression on military  began at least as early as the 1920s.  is a trade name for a group of CFCs which are used primarily as , but also have uses in fire-fighting and as propellants in . Bromomethane is widely used as a fumigant. Dichloromethane is a versatile industrial solvent.\nThe Belgian scientist  pioneered the synthesis of CFCs in the 1890s. He developed an effective exchange agent to replace chloride in carbon tetrachloride with fluoride to synthesize CFC-11 (CClF) and CFC-12 (CClF).\nIn the late 1920s,  improved the process of synthesis and led the effort to use CFC as refrigerant to replace  (NH),  (CHCl), and  (SO), which are toxic but were in common use. In searching for a new refrigerant, requirements for the compound were: low , low toxicity, and to be generally non-reactive. In a demonstration for the , Midgley flamboyantly demonstrated all these properties by inhaling a breath of the gas and using it to blow out a candle in 1930.\nDuring , various chloroalkanes were in standard use in military aircraft, although these early halons suffered from excessive toxicity. Nevertheless, after the war they slowly became more common in civil aviation as well. In the 1960s, fluoroalkanes and bromofluoroalkanes became available and were quickly recognized as being highly effective fire-fighting materials. Much early research with  was conducted under the auspices of the US Armed Forces, while  was, initially, mainly developed in the UK. By the late 1960s they were standard in many applications where water and dry-powder extinguishers posed a threat of damage to the protected property, including computer rooms, telecommunications switches, laboratories, museums and art collections. Beginning with , in the 1970s, bromofluoroalkanes also progressively came to be associated with rapid knockdown of severe fires in confined spaces with minimal risk to personnel.\nBy the early 1980s, bromofluoroalkanes were in common use on aircraft, ships, and large vehicles as well as in computer facilities and galleries. However, concern was beginning to be expressed about the impact of chloroalkanes and bromoalkanes on the . The  did not cover bromofluoroalkanes as it was thought, at the time, that emergency discharge of extinguishing systems was too small in volume to produce a significant impact, and too important to human safety for restriction.\nSince the late 1970s, the use of CFCs has been heavily regulated because of their destructive effects on the . After the development of his ,  was the first to detect the widespread presence of CFCs in the air, finding a  of 60  of CFC-11 over . In a self-funded research expedition ending in 1973, Lovelock went on to measure CFC-11 in both the Arctic and Antarctic, finding the presence of the gas in each of 50 air samples collected, and concluding that CFCs are not hazardous to the environment. The experiment did however provide the first useful data on the presence of CFCs in the atmosphere. The damage caused by CFCs was discovered by  and  who, after hearing a lecture on the subject of Lovelock's work, embarked on research resulting in the first publication suggesting the connection in 1974. It turns out that one of CFCs' most attractive features\u2014their low reactivity\u2014 is key to their most destructive effects. CFCs' lack of reactivity gives them a lifespan that can exceed 100 years, giving them time to diffuse into the upper .  Once in the stratosphere, the sun's  radiation is strong enough to cause the  cleavage of the C-Cl bond. In 1978, under the Toxic Substances Control Act, the EPA banned commercial manufacturing and use of CFCS and aerosol propellants. This was later superseded by broader regulation by the EPA under the Clean Air Act to address stratospheric ozone depletion.\nBy 1987, in response to a dramatic seasonal depletion of the ozone layer over , diplomats in  forged a treaty, the , which called for drastic reductions in the production of CFCs. On 2 March 1989, 12  nations agreed to ban the production of all CFCs by the end of the century. In 1990, diplomats met in  and voted to significantly strengthen the Montreal Protocol by calling for a complete elimination of CFCs by the year 2000. By the year 2010, CFCs should have been completely eliminated from developing countries as well.\nBecause the only CFCs available to countries adhering to the treaty is from recycling, their prices have increased considerably. A worldwide end to production should also terminate the smuggling of this material. However, there are current CFC smuggling issues, as recognized by the  (UNEP) in a 2006 report titled \"Illegal Trade in Ozone Depleting Substances\". UNEP estimates that between 16,000\u201338,000 tonnes of CFCs passed through the black market in the mid-1990s. The report estimated between 7,000 and 14,000 tonnes of CFCs are smuggled annually into developing countries. Asian countries are those with the most smuggling; as of 2007, China, India and South Korea were found to account for around 70% of global CFC production, South Korea later to ban CFC production in 2010. Possible reasons for continued CFC smuggling were also examined: the report noted that many banned CFC producing products have long lifespans and continue to operate. The cost of replacing the equipment of these items is sometimes cheaper than outfitting them with a more ozone-friendly appliance. Additionally, CFC smuggling is not considered a significant issue, so the perceived penalties for smuggling are low. In 2018 public attention was drawn to the issue, that at an unknown place in east Asia an estimated amount of 13,000 metric tons annually of CFCs have been produced since about 2012 in violation of the protocol. While the eventual phaseout of CFCs is likely, efforts are being taken to stem these current non-compliance problems.\nBy the time of the , it was realised that deliberate and accidental discharges during system tests and maintenance accounted for substantially larger volumes than emergency discharges, and consequently halons were brought into the treaty, albeit with many exceptions.\nWhile the production and consumption of CFCs are regulated under the Montreal Protocol, emissions from existing banks of CFCs are not regulated under the agreement. In 2002, there were an estimated 5,791 kilotons of CFCs in existing products such as refrigerators, air conditioners, aerosol cans and others. Approximately one-third of these CFCs are projected to be emitted over the next decade if action is not taken, posing a threat to both the ozone layer and the climate. A proportion of these CFCs can be safely captured and destroyed.\nIn 1978 the United States banned the use of CFCs such as Freon in aerosol cans, the beginning of a long series of regulatory actions against their use. The critical DuPont manufacturing patent for Freon (\"Process for Fluorinating Halohydrocarbons\", U.S. Patent #3258500) was set to expire in 1979. In conjunction with other industrial peers DuPont formed a lobbying group, the \"Alliance for Responsible CFC Policy,\" to combat regulations of ozone-depleting compounds. In 1986 DuPont, with new patents in hand, reversed its previous stance and publicly condemned CFCs. DuPont representatives appeared before the  urging that CFCs be banned worldwide and stated that their new HCFCs would meet the worldwide demand for refrigerants.\nUse of certain chloroalkanes as solvents for large scale application, such as dry cleaning, have been phased out, for example, by the  directive on  in 1994 and by the  (VOC) directive of the  in 1997. Permitted chlorofluoroalkane uses are medicinal only.\nBromofluoroalkanes have been largely phased out and the possession of equipment for their use is prohibited in some countries like the Netherlands and Belgium, from 1 January 2004, based on the  and guidelines of the European Union.\nProduction of new stocks ceased in most (probably all) countries in 1994. However many countries still require aircraft to be fitted with halon fire suppression systems because no safe and completely satisfactory alternative has been discovered for this application. There are also a few other, highly specialized uses. These programs recycle halon through \"halon banks\" coordinated by the Halon Recycling Corporation to ensure that discharge to the atmosphere occurs only in a genuine emergency and to conserve remaining stocks.\nThe interim replacements for CFCs are hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), which deplete stratospheric ozone, but to a much lesser extent than CFCs. Ultimately,  will replace HCFCs. Unlike CFCs and HCFCs, HFCs have an ozone depletion potential (ODP) of 0.  DuPont began producing hydrofluorocarbons as alternatives to Freon in the 1980s. These included Suva refrigerants and Dymel propellants. Natural refrigerants are climate friendly solutions that are enjoying increasing support from large companies and governments interested in reducing global warming emissions from refrigeration and air conditioning.\nHydrofluorocarbons are included in the  because of their very high  and are facing calls to be regulated under the  due to the recognition of halocarbon contributions to climate change.\nOn 21 September 2007, approximately 200 countries agreed to accelerate the elimination of hydrochlorofluorocarbons entirely by 2020 in a -sponsored  summit. Developing nations were given until 2030. Many nations, such as the  and , who had previously , agreed with the accelerated phase out schedule.\nWork on alternatives for chlorofluorocarbons in refrigerants began in the late 1970s after the first warnings of damage to  ozone were published.\nThe hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are less stable in the lower atmosphere, enabling them to break down before reaching the ozone layer. Nevertheless, a significant fraction of the HCFCs do break down in the  and they have contributed to more chlorine buildup there than originally predicted. Later alternatives lacking the chlorine, the hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) have an even shorter lifetimes in the lower atmosphere. One of these compounds, , were used in place of CFC-12 in automobile air conditioners. Hydrocarbon refrigerants (a propane/isobutane blend) were also used extensively in mobile air conditioning systems in Australia, the US and many other countries, as they had excellent thermodynamic properties and performed particularly well in high ambient temperatures.  (HCFC-141b) has replaced HFC-134a, due to its low ODP and GWP values. And according to the Montreal Protocol, HCFC-141b is supposed to be phased out completely and replaced with zero ODP substances such as cyclopentane, HFOs, and HFC-345a before January 2020.\nAmong the natural refrigerants (along with ammonia and carbon dioxide), hydrocarbons have negligible environmental impacts and are also used worldwide in domestic and commercial refrigeration applications, and are becoming available in new split system air conditioners.\nVarious other solvents and methods have replaced the use of CFCs in laboratory analytics.\nIn  (MDI), a non-ozone effecting substitute was developed as a propellant, known as \".\"\nBecause the time history of CFC concentrations in the atmosphere is relatively well known, they have provided an important constraint on ocean circulation. CFCs dissolve in seawater at the ocean surface and are subsequently transported into the ocean interior. Because CFCs are inert, their concentration in the ocean interior reflects simply the convolution of their atmospheric time evolution and ocean circulation and mixing.\nChlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are anthropogenic compounds that have been released into the atmosphere since the 1930s in various applications such as in air-conditioning, refrigeration, blowing agents in foams, insulations and packing materials, propellants in aerosol cans, and as solvents.  The entry of CFCs into the ocean makes them extremely useful as transient tracers to estimate rates and pathways of ocean circulation and mixing processes. However, due to production restrictions of CFCs in the 1980s, atmospheric concentrations of CFC-11 and CFC-12 has stopped increasing, and the CFC-11 to CFC-12 ratio in the atmosphere have been steadily decreasing, making water dating of water masses more problematic. Incidentally, production and release of sulfur hexafluoride (SF) have rapidly increased in the atmosphere since the 1970s. Similar to CFCs, SF is also an inert gas and is not affected by oceanic chemical or biological activities. Thus, using CFCs in concert with SF as a tracer resolves the water dating issues due to decreased CFC concentrations.\nUsing CFCs or SF as a tracer of ocean circulation allows for the derivation of rates for ocean processes due to the time-dependent source function. The elapsed time since a subsurface water mass was last in contact with the atmosphere is the tracer-derived age. Estimates of age can be derived based on the partial pressure of an individual compound and the ratio of the partial pressure of CFCs to each other (or SF).\nThe age of a water parcel can be estimated by the CFC partial pressure (pCFC) age or SF partial pressure (pSF) age. The pCFC age of a water sample is defined as:\nwhere [CFC] is the measured CFC concentration (pmol kg) and F is the solubility of CFC gas in seawater as a function of temperature and salinity. The CFC partial pressure is expressed in units of 10\u201312 atmospheres or parts-per-trillion (ppt). The solubility measurements of CFC-11 and CFC-12 have been previously measured by Warner and Weiss Additionally, the solubility measurement of CFC-113 was measured by Bu and Warner and SF by Wanninkhof et al. and Bullister et al.  Theses authors mentioned above have expressed the solubility (F) at a total pressure of 1 atm as:\nwhere F = solubility expressed in either mol l or mol kg atm,\nT = absolute temperature,\nS = salinity in parts per thousand (ppt),\na, a, a, b, b, and b are constants to be determined from the least squares fit to the solubility measurements. This equation is derived from the integrated  and the logarithmic Setchenow salinity dependence.\nIt can be noted that the solubility of CFCs increase with decreasing temperature at approximately 1% per degree Celsius.\nOnce the partial pressure of the CFC (or SF) is derived, it is then compared to the atmospheric time histories for CFC-11, CFC-12, or SF in which the pCFC directly corresponds to the year with the same.  The difference between the corresponding date and the collection date of the seawater sample is the average age for the water parcel. The age of a parcel of water can also be calculated using the ratio of two CFC partial pressures or the ratio of the SF partial pressure to a CFC partial pressure.\nAccording to their material safety data sheets, CFCs and HCFCs are colorless, volatile, non-toxic liquids and gases with a faintly sweet ethereal odor. Overexposure at concentrations of 11% or more may cause dizziness, loss of concentration, central nervous system depression or . Vapors displace air and can cause asphyxiation in confined spaces. Although non-flammable, their combustion products include hydrofluoric acid, and related species.\nNormal occupational exposure is rated at 0.07% and does not pose any serious health risks.\n"},

The values or concentrations attributed to such  can be used to describe the pollution status of an environment, its biotic status or to predict the likelihood or otherwise of a particular organisms  being present. Monitoring of environmental quality parameters is a key activity in managing the environment, restoring polluted environments and anticipating the effects of man-made changes on the environment.\n are those  chemical, physical or biological parameters that can be used to characterise a freshwater body. Because almost all water bodies are dynamic in their composition, the relevant quality parameters are typically expressed as a range of expected concentrations.\nThe first step in understanding the chemistry of freshwater is to establish the relevant concentrations of the parameters of interest. Conventionally this is done by taking representative samples of the water for subsequent analysis in a laboratory . However, in-situ monitoring using hand-held analytical equipment or using bank-side monitoring stations are also used.\nFreshwaters are surprisingly difficult to sample because they are rarely  and their quality varies during the day and during the year. In addition the most representative sampling locations are often at a distance from the shore or bank increasing the logistic complexity.\nFilling a clean bottle with river water is a very simple task, but a single sample is only representative of that point along the river the sample was taken from and at that point in time. Understanding the chemistry of a whole river, or even a significant tributary, requires prior investigation to understand how homogeneous or mixed the flow is and to determine if the quality changes during the course of a day and during the course of a year. Almost all natural rivers will have very significant patterns of change through the day and through the seasons.  offers a spatially continuous tool to improve understanding of spatial and temporal river water quality. Many rivers also have a very large flow that is unseen. This flows through underlying gravel and sand layers and is called . How much mixing there is between the hyporheic zone and the water in the open channel will depend on a variety of factors, some of which relate to flows leaving  which may have been storing water for many years.\nGround waters by their very nature  are often very difficult to access to take a sample. As a consequence the majority of ground-water data comes from samples taken from , , water supply bore-holes and in natural . In recent decades as the need to understand ground water dynamics has increased, an increasing number or monitoring bore-holes have been drilled into aquifers\n\nLakes  and ponds can be very large  and support a complex  eco-system in which environmental parameters vary widely in all three physical dimensions and with time. Large lakes in the temperate zone often stratify in the warmer months into a warmer upper layers rich in oxygen and a colder lower layer with low oxygen levels. In the autumn, falling temperatures and  occasional high winds result in the mixing of the two layers into a more homogeneous whole. When stratification occurs it not only affects oxygen levels but also many related parameters such as ,  and  which are all changed in their chemical form by change in the  potential of the environment.\nLakes also receive waters, often from many different sources with varying qualities. Solids from stream inputs will typically settle near the mouth of the stream and depending on a variety of factors the incoming water may float over the surface of the lake, sink beneath the surface or rapidly mix with the lake water. All of these phenomena can  skew the results of any environmental monitoring unless the process are well understood.\nWhere two rivers meet at a confluence there exists a mixing zone. A mixing zone may be very large and extend for many miles as in the case of the  and  rivers in the  and the  and  in . In a mixing zone water chemistry may be very variable and can be difficult to predict. The chemical interactions are not just simple mixing but may be complicated by biological processes from submerged  and by water joining the channel from the  zone or from springs draining an aquifer.\nThe geology that underlies a river or lake has a major impact on its chemistry. A river flowing across very ancient   is likely to have dissolved very little from the rocks and maybe similar to de-ionised water at least in the headwaters. Conversely a river flowing through  hills, and especially if its source is in the chalk, will have a high concentration of  and  of  and possibly .\nAs a river progresses along its course it may pass through a variety of geological types and it may have inputs from aquifers that do not appear on the surface anywhere in the locality.\nOxygen is probably the most important chemical constituent of surface water chemistry, as all  require it for survival.  It enters the water mostly via diffusion at the water-air interface.  Oxygen's solubility in water decreases as water temperature increases. Fast, turbulent streams expose more of the water's surface area to the air and tend to have low temperatures and thus more oxygen than slow, backwaters.  Oxygen is a by-product of photosynthesis, so systems with a high abundance of aquatic algae and plants may also have high concentrations of oxygen during the day.  These levels can decrease significantly during the night when primary producers switch to respiration.  Oxygen can be limiting if circulation between the surface and deeper layers is poor, if the activity of animals is very high, or if there is a large amount of organic decay occurring such as following Autumn leaf-fall.\nMost other atmospheric inputs come from man-made or  sources the most significant of which are the oxides of sulphur produced by burning sulphur rich fuels such as  and  which give rise to . The chemistry of  is complex both in the  and in river systems. However the effect on the overall chemistry is simple in that it reduces the pH of the water making it more acidic. The pH change is most marked in rivers with very low concentrations of dissolved salts as these cannot  the effects of the acid input. Rivers downstream of major industrial conurbations are also at greatest risk. In parts of  and  and  many rivers became so acidic from oxides of sulphur that most fish life was destroyed and pHs as low as pH4 were recorded  during critical weather conditions.\nThe majority of rivers on the planet and many lakes have received or are receiving inputs from human-kind's activities. In the industrialised world, many rivers have been very seriously polluted, at least during the 19th and the first half of the 20th centuries. Although in general there has been much improvement in the developed world, there is still a great deal of river pollution apparent on the planet.\nIn most environmental situations the presence or absence of an organism is determined by a complex web of interactions only some of which will be related to measurable chemical or biological parameters. Flow rate, turbulence, inter and intra specific competition, feeding behaviour, , ,  and  are just a few of the pressures and opportunities facing any organism or population. Most chemical constituents favour some organisms and are less favourable to others. However, there are some cases where a chemical constituent exerts a toxic effect. i.e. where the concentration can kill or severely inhibit the normal functioning of the organism. Where a toxic effect has been demonstrated this may be noted in the sections below dealing with the individual parameters.\nOften it is the colour of freshwater or how clear or hazy the water is that is the most obvious visual characteristic. Unfortunately neither colour nor turbidity are strong indicators of the overall chemical composition of water. However both colour and turbidity reduce the amount of light penetrating the water and can have significant impact on algae and macrophytes. Some algae in particular are highly dependent on water with low colour and turbidity\nMany rivers draining high moor-lands overlain by  have a very deep yellow brown colour caused by dissolved .\nOne of the principal sources of elevated concentrations of organic chemical constituents is from treated sewage.\nDissolved organic material is most commonly measured using either the  (BOD) test or the  (COD) test. Organic constituents are significant in river chemistry for the effect that they have on dissolved oxygen concentration and for the impact that individual organic species may have directly on aquatic biota.\nAny organic and degradable material consumes oxygen as it decomposes. Where organic concentrations are significantly elevated the effects on oxygen concentrations can be significant and as conditions get extreme the river bed may become .\nSome organic constituents such as synthetic , ,  have direct metabolic effects on aquatic biota and even on humans drinking water taken from the river. Understanding such constituents and how they can be identified and quantified is becoming of increasing importance in the understanding of freshwater chemistry.\nA wide range of metals may be found in rivers from natural sources where metal ores are present in the rocks over which the river flows or in the aquifers feeding water into the river. However many rivers have an increased load of metals because of industrial activities which include mining and quarrying and the processing and use of metals.\nIron, usually as Fe is a common constituent of river waters at very low levels. Higher iron concentrations in acidic springs or an anoxic hyporheic zone may cause visible orange/brown staining or semi-gelatinous precipitates of dense orange   carpeting the river bed. Such conditions are very deleterious to most organisms and can cause serious damage in a river system.\nCoal mining is also a very significant source of  Iron both in mine-waters and from stocking yards of coal and from coal processing. Long abandoned mines can be a highly intractable source of high concentrations of Iron.\nLow levels of iron are common in spring waters emanating from deep-seated aquifers and maybe regarding as health giving springs. Such springs are commonly called  springs and have given rise to a number of  towns in Europe and the United States.\n is normally associated with metal mining, especially Lead and Silver mining but is also a component pollutant associated with a variety of other metal mining activities and with . Zinc is toxic at relatively low concentrations to many aquatic organisms.  starts to show a toxic reaction at concentrations as low as 0.33\u00a0mg/l \nLead and silver in river waters are commonly found together and associated with  lead mining. Impacts from very old mines can be very long-lived. In the  in  for example, the effects of silver and lead mining in the 17th and 18th centuries in the headwaters still causes unacceptably high levels of Zinc and  in the river water right down to its confluence with the sea. \n is very toxic even at very low concentrations but leaves no visible evidence of its contamination.\nLead is also highly toxic to freshwater organisms and to humans if the water is used as drinking water. As with Silver, Lead pollution is not visible to the naked eye. The  in west Wales had a major series of lead mines in its headwaters until the end of the 19th century and its mine discharges and waste tips remain to this day. In 1919 - 1921  only 14 species of invertebrates were found in the lower Rheidol when Lead concentrations were between 0.2ppm and 0.5ppm. By 1932 the lead concentration had reduced to 0.02ppm to 0.1ppm because of the abandonment of mining and, at those concentrations, the bottom fauna had stabilized to 103 species including three .\nCoal mining is also a very significant source of metals, especially Iron, Zinc and  particularly where the coal is rich if  which oxidises on contact with the air producing a very acidic  which is able to dissolve metals from the coal.\nSignificant levels of copper are unusual in rivers and where it does it occur the source is most likely to be mining activities, coal stocking, or  farming. Rarely elevated levels may be of geological origin. Copper is acutely toxic to many freshwater organisms, especially algae, at very low concentrations and significant concentration in river water may have serious adverse effects on the local ecology.\nNitrogenous compounds have a variety of sources including washout of oxides of nitrogen from the atmosphere, some geological inputs and some from macrophyte and  . However, for many rivers in the proximity of humans, the largest input is from sewage whether treated or untreated. The nitrogen derives from breakdown products of  found in  and . These products, being very soluble, often pass through sewage treatment process and are discharged into rivers as a component of  effluent. Nitrogen may be in the form of , ,  or ammonium salts or what is termed albuminoid nitrogen or nitrogen still within an organic proteinoid molecule.\nThe differing forms of nitrogen are relatively stable in most river systems with nitrite slowly transforming into nitrate in well oxygenated rivers and ammonia transforming into nitrite/ nitrate. However, the process are slow in cool rivers and reduction in concentration may more often be attributed to simple dilution. All forms of nitrogen are taken up by macrophytes and algae and elevated levels of nitrogen are often associated with overgrowths of plants or . These can have the effect of blocking channels and inhibiting . However, ecologically, the more significant effect is on dissolved oxygen concentrations which may become super-saturated during daylight due to plant  but then drop to very low levels during darkness as plant respiration uses up the dissolved oxygen. Coupled with the release of oxygen in photosynthesis is the creation of bi-carbonate ions which cause a steep rise in pH and this is matched in darkness as  is released through respiration which substantially lowers the pH. Thus high levels of nitrogenous compounds tends to lead to eutrophication with extreme variations in parameters which in turn can substantially degrade the ecological worth of the watercourse.\nAmmonium ions also have a toxic effect, especially on . The toxicity of ammonia is dependent on both pH and temperature  and an added complexity is the buffering effect of the blood/water interface across the   which masks any additional toxicity over about pH 8.0. The management of river chemistry to avoid ecological damage is particularly difficult in the case of ammonia as a wide range of potential scenarios of concentration, pH and temperature have to be considered and the diurnal pH fluctuation caused by photosynthesis considered. On warm summer days with high-bi-carbonate concentrations unexpectedly toxic conditions can be created.\n compounds are usually found as relatively insoluble phosphates in river water and, except in some exceptional circumstances, their origin is  or human sewage. Phosphorus can encourage excessive growths of plants and algae and contribute to . If a river discharges into a lake or reservoir phosphate can be mobilised year after year by natural processes. In the summer time, lakes stratify so that warm oxygen rich water floats on top of cold oxygen poor water. In the warm upper layers - the - plants consume the available phosphate. As the plants die in the late summer they fall into the cool water layers underneath - the  - and decompose. During winter turn-over, when a lake becomes fully mixed through the action of winds on a cooling body of water - the phosphates are spread throughout the lake again to feed a new generation of plants. This process is one of the principal causes of persistent  at some lakes.\nGeological deposits of arsenic may be released into rivers where deep ground-waters are exploited as in parts of . Many metalloid ores such as lead, gold and  contain traces of arsenic and poorly stored tailings may result in arsenic entering the .\nInert solids are produced in all montane rivers as the energy of the water helps grind away rocks into gravel, sand and finer material. Much of this settles very quickly and provides an important substrate for many aquatic organisms. Many  fish require beds of gravel and sand in which to lay their eggs.\nMany other types of solids from agriculture, mining, quarrying, urban run-off and sewage may block-out sunlight from the river and may block interstices in gravel beds making them useless for spawning and supporting insect life.\nBoth agriculture and sewage treatment produce  inputs into rivers with very high concentrations of  and  including a wide range of  organisms. Even in areas with little human activity significant levels of bacteria and viruses can be detected originating from fish and aquatic mammals and from animals grazing near rivers such as .\nUpland waters draining areas frequented by ,  or deer may also harbour a variety of opportunistic human parasites such as . Consequently, there are very few rivers from which the water is safe to drink without some form of sterilisation or disinfection. In rivers used for contact recreation such as swimming, safe levels of bacteria and viruses can be established based on risk assessment.\nUnder certain conditions bacteria can colonise freshwaters occasionally making large rafts of filamentous mats known as  \u2013 usually . The presence of such organisms is almost always an indicator of extreme  and would be expected to be matched with low dissolved oxygen concentrations and high BOD vales.\n bacteria have been commonly found in recreational waters and their presence is used to indicate the presence of recent faecal contamination, but E. coli presence may not be indicative of human waste.  are found in all warm-blooded animals.    have also been found in  fish and turtles.   may also persist in the environment in mud, sediments, sand and soil for considerable lengths of time.\npH in rivers is affected by the geology of the water source, atmospheric inputs and a range of other chemical contaminants. pH is only likely to become an issue on very poorly buffered upland rivers where atmospheric sulphur and  may very significantly depress the pH as low as pH4 or in eutrophic alkaline rivers where photosynthetic bi-carbonate ion production in photosynthesis may drive the pH up above pH10\n\n\n"},

The highly \"unnatural\" processes of chemical engineering, manufacturing, packaging, distribution, and disposal would all aspire to a state of nature, where anything and everything is a renewable resource. The familiar three R's of \"reduce, reuse, recycle\" would apply not just to products at the end of their life span, but to the materials and methods that created them.In this perfect system, each unit of energy consumed would be somehow offset. Every industrial byproduct would reassemble into something useful and benign. Every beam of sunlight, scrap of garbage, and flush of the toilet would be pressed into service. No exceptions. Humankind would make obsolete the very concept of \"waste.\"This is the environmental philosophy of \"zero waste,\" a total vision of sustainability for our eco-panicked age. \"Zero waste looks at what nature has given us as a model,\" says Larry Chalfan, executive director of the nonprofit Zero Waste Alliance in Portland, Ore. \"Everything at the end of its life, whether it's a flower or a dead body, is recycled; there are no toxic substances or 'waste' built up anywhere to cause harm to future generations. Everything is a resource to be used again.\"Zero waste may seem more of a Platonic ideal than a realistic objective. But a growing number of communities and businesses worldwide are adopting its principles, drawn to both its environmental and economic advantages. Corporations such as , , , and Ford have all set zero-waste targets for their operations, and so have the cities of Oakland, San Francisco, and Seattle, among others. Outside the United States, New Zealand and regions of Australia and Canada have committed themselves to the zero-waste challenge, and Great Britain is touting the 2012 Olympics in London as the first \"zero-waste games.\"With its faint ring of the incredible, zero waste is in some ways still more of a buzz phrase, a branding concept for a big idea, than a reality. \"We see it as an educational tool to get businesses thinking about what's in their trash,\" says Adam Mitchell, a partner in Save That Stuff, a waste management company in Charlestown.But the idea it's selling is a vital one, challenging businesses not only to think about what is in their trash but also to rethink their definition of what trash is. As William McDonough and Michael Braungart wrote in their eco-design manifesto, \"Cradle to Cradle\" (2002), that stuff we throw away \"is just the tip of a material iceberg . . . contain[ing] on average only 5 percent of the raw materials involved in the process of making and delivering it.\" As Chalfan puts it, \"Recycling doesn't change what's already there. We have to rethink how products are made in the first place.\"\"The whole concept of zero waste may be unattainable -- it may be a mythical goal,\" says John Warner, director of the Center for Green Chemistry at the University of Massachusetts at Lowell. \"That doesn't mean it's not worth working toward the goal.\". . .What does zero waste mean in practice? It depends on whom you ask. For example, most municipalities that have declared themselves \"zero waste\" take the phrase at face value, concentrating on diverting all of their garbage from landfills through recycling and composting. Others push harder, such as companies seeking to eliminate all forms of waste from each stage of the manufacturing process. Nike is arguably the leader among multinationals for zero-waste product design, using recyclable polymers, water-based solvents (which reduce both toxins and energy consumption), and fabric woven from used soda bottles. The household chemical manufacturer SC Johnson evaluates the ingredients in every product using their \"greenlist\" test, which rates raw materials on the basis of biodegradability and toxicity.The zero-waste mindset is particularly strong here in Massachusetts. In Boston, the Massachusetts Office of Technical Assistance and Technology (OTA) is researching methods using ultraviolet light and digital technology that would radically reduce the energy, water, and chemical costs that are currently required for printing on textiles.The energy savings would be a boon to the state's textile businesses, which have taken a severe beating from low-cost Asian imports. But the zero-waste approach might have other, less apparent business advantages. According to OTA director Paul Richard, local firms would gain an edge in the European market, which has more vigilant restrictions on the use and disposal of toxic materials than the United States.The microelectronics industry is also experimenting with a zero-waste approach. At the Center for Green Chemistry, Warner has developed a process for creating printed circuit boards that works at room temperature, using a nontoxic polymer that mimics the self-assembling properties of DNA. All unused materials can be recovered from the rinse water -- no harmful solvents, reagents, or hazardous waste products required.Such a clean, closed-loop process could potentially have a major impact on a sector that produces startling amounts of waste at the manufacturing level. In a much-discussed 2002 paper, Eric D. Williams of the United Nations University in Tokyo found that 1.7 kilograms of water, fossil fuels, and chemicals are required to produce a typical 2-gram microchip. Williams concluded, \"The environmental weight of a microchip belies its tiny size.\"The same might be said about many products of the pharmaceutical industry. \"The typical efficiency factor for a pharmaceutical process is more than 100 kilograms of waste for every kilogram of product,\" says Berkeley \"Buzz\" Cue, who formerly led the green chemistry team at . Cue says he's seen impressive improvements in such processes in recent years -- up to tenfold reductions in waste. But he also cautions that eliminating waste completely is not realistic.\"You're not going to see zero waste,\" Cue says. \"But zero waste is useful as an ambitious, aggressive goal.\" A good analogy might be the four-minute mile, once perceived as an impenetrable barrier for mere mortals. \"We'll never run the mile in zero minutes, we probably won't run it in one minute, but you've got to push the envelope to get the most talented people excited about coming close,\" Cue says.There are significant costs to getting there, however, and the rewards are not always obvious. \"Accounting practices don't necessarily deal with the cost of waste,\" explains Kira Matus, who is a doctoral candidate in public policy at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government and a doctoral research fellow at the Center for International Development. \"The EPA will penalize you for polluting, but there's very little incentive even to think about how you would go no-waste.\"Revamping the manufacturing process is also a daunting proposition given the high costs of compliance with the EPA and, for pharma companies, FDA regulations. \"Once you're invested, you don't want to tear the whole thing down -- you could be abandoning millions of dollars in environmental control technology,\" Matus says. As Cue puts it, \"Nobody wants to get FDA approval and then change their manufacturing processes. It would be like getting an A on a test and then asking the teacher to re-grade the exam.\". . .Yet for businesses further along on the supply chain, the environmental benefits of zero-waste methods can seem virtually incidental to the economic rewards. This is especially true for those companies that start out green rather than ones trying to change in midstream.\"It wasn't my original intention to open a business with a particular dedication to environmental goals,\" says Bill Bridgeman, CEO of the Dry Cleaning Station, a chain based in Portland, Ore. \"But it soon became obvious that it could be a competitive advantage. It's a marketing tool that we've been able to use very effectively.\"The Dry Cleaning Station invested $85,000 in a machine that uses, filters, and recycles GreenEarth, a biodegradable, silicon-based solvent; for the same money, Bridgeman could have purchased five or more machines fitted for perchloroethylene, or \"perc,\" the kerosene-like chemical deployed in traditional dry-cleaning processes.\"If I poured perc on my floor, it would eat through the carpet and concrete; it seeks groundwater and ends up in the water table,\" Bridgeman says. \"If I poured out GreenEarth, the next day I'd have a pile of common beach sand.\" And precisely because GreenEarth is a safer, gentler process, Bridgeman says, it reduces the muting of colors that often results from the harsh chemical processes of conventional dry cleaning. According to Bridgeman, the Dry Cleaning Station's combination of green credentials and superior technology has helped to result in 400 percent growth over two years in business.The Longfellow Clubs, a group of fitness centers in the MetroWest region, has also made considerable financial investments to reduce waste. President and general manager Laury Hammel reckons it will take a year and a half to make back the $15,000 he invested in an ecologically-sound saltwater purification system for his pool facilities (the quick turnaround owes to the high price of chlorine). The waterless urinals in the Longfellow men's rooms, which cost a total of $1,600 each for purchase and installation, will take longer to pay for themselves: about five to six years. But they'll save 45,000 gallons of water per year and postpone the inevitable date when Hammel will have to replace his septic system.In terms of achieving zero waste, Hammel says, \"If you're just talking about physical waste, that's very doable, but if you're talking about the whole enchilada, that's another story.\"\"It's great to strive toward zero waste,\" concurs Tedd Saunders, executive vice president of the Boston-based Saunders Hotel Group, \"but I don't know how anyone in the modern world gets there.\" The Saunders hotels, which include Back Bay luxury spot the Lenox, use energy-efficient lighting and vending machines, composting of food waste, infrared sensors that adjust heating and cooling according to whether a room is occupied, and a chlorine-free ionization process for pool-cleaning duties.Green and sustainable, yes -- but a long way from zero waste, says Saunders, who is also the president of the consulting firm Ecological Solutions. \"A company would have to look at the sourcing of their materials, how their food was grown, the means of transportation -- how far back to the cradle do you go?\" he asks.It may be that the vision of zero waste is \"a function of perspective,\" as Bridgeman puts it. He provides an example: \"Our locations run 100 percent on wind power. It's far more expensive than regular power -- so from an economic standpoint, is that really 'zero waste'? Somebody had to make a wind turbine; did they use recycled material? What about when they shipped it and put up the turbine? You could go on and on.\"Perhaps the path to zero waste might be pictured best as an asymptote, forever curving toward its destination. The goal isn't to arrive there, Bridgeman says, but to come \"as close as you can get.\""},

Six years ago, it became a trendsetter and leader, not just in Italy but throughout all of Europe, as the continent\u2019s first Zero Waste town.Today, about 3.5 million Italian citizens carefully separate their waste into coloured bags before leaving them on their doorsteps for collection. The movement has spread further, too, to other European countries.Giorgio del Ghingaro, the mayor of Capannori (population 46,000), defines this trend as a \u201ccultural revolution\u201d that began with rubbish and in time went much further. Since 2007, residents of Capannori have reduced their urban waste by 30 percent as part of a Zero Waste strategy, which calls for the elimination of all superfluous waste \u2013 anything that can be recycled \u2013 by 2020.In Capannori, they are determined to meet this deadline. \u201cZero waste by 2020 is no utopia,\u201d Del Ghingaro told IPS. \u201cIt is a concrete goal that we intend to achieve\u201d.Initially, the project looked quite ambitious. Its model was that of San Francisco, California, which differs from the Tuscan town in size and conformation. Nevertheless, Capannori\u2019s midterm goal of recycling 75 percent of waste by 2015 was met long in advance; the town currently recycles 82 percent.After Capannori tested door-to-door collection methods in one part of the town, successfully increasing waste recycling from 30 to 70 percent, \u201cwe decided to embark in the zero waste adventure\u201d, Del Ghingaro said.Since then, Capannori\u2019s waste management has become a model for all of Europe. Joan Marc Simon, executive director of  and European coordinator of the , confirms that the Zero Waste strategy came to Spain through the Italian experience.\u201cWhen it comes to waste, Italy has given the best and worst examples. But if you look at the good practices\u2026Italy, and Capannori in particular, was definitely the model to follow,\u201d Simon said.Since 2008, one hundred cities in Spain, all concentrated in Catalonia and the Basque Country, have adopted the strategy. \u201cSouthern Europe is giving a lesson on how things can and should be done in a more sustainable way,\u201d Simon stressed.Rossano Ercolini, Capannori resident, primary school teacher and environmental activist who is the winner of the Goldman Prize for the environment, knows well how local experience can serve the rest of Europe. After all, he is the man who introduced the Zero Waste strategy to Italy \u2013 and Europe.It all started in 1997, when construction plans for an incinerator near the town encountered firm opposition. Ercolini, who is also president of Zero Waste Europe and of Ambiente e Futuro (Environment and Future), a local environmental movement, was part of it.\u201cAmbiente e Futuro engaged in a strong fight against this proposal,\u201d he explained. Key to the movement\u2019s success was \u201cinforming the population about the risks of incineration and offering them a viable alternative. Without the citizens\u2019 commitment, none of this would be possible.\u201dIn introducing the alternative method of separate collection, \u201cwe held assemblies\u2026to explain the new system and to hear people\u2019s doubts and concerns,\u201d Ercolini recounted. \u201cWe worked together to find solutions.\u201dLuigi, 67, has lived in Capannori for over 40 years. \u201cPeople always find a reason to complain,\u201d he said of the door-to-door collection system. \u201cBut honestly, I find the system quite easy.\u201d Residents are given different rubbish bins and coloured bags, along with an informational flyer. \u201cIf you get it wrong, they just leave a note explaining why they could not collect your bag\u201d.Indeed, the town decided to avoid fines, so as not to penalise residents for mistakes, and to reward residents instead. Beginning in January, they introduced something called an R-feed waste system.\u201cEvery family has been given a fixed number of gray bags\u2026 for non-recyclable waste, with a code on it. The garbage collector has a reader which stores the data so that every family will pay waste tax according to how much non-recyclable rubbish they produced throughout the year,\u201d Del Ghingaro explained.Zero Waste does not mean just door-to-door separate collection. It also requires a series of parallel actions aimed at reducing the production of avoidable waste. \u201cWe strongly focused on water,\u201d Del Ghingaro told IPS. \u201cBuying water at the supermarket means also buying a lot of plastic. Therefore we made a strong campaign in order to enhance the use of public water.\u201dFifteen public water springs were restored and purified, and plastic bottles have been banned from all schools and public buildings, which now use only public water.For now, Ercolini\u2019s task is to analyse the 18 percent of rubbish that still requires traditional waste management and find a solution. The results so far show that the main problem lies at the roots of the production chain. \u201cCompanies need to take responsibility for what they put on the market and redesign their products in order to make them sustainable,\u201d he says.Following a letter of concern that the Capannori Municipality wrote to the coffee giant Lavazza, the company started a pilot project to substitute standard non-recyclable coffee capsules for espresso machines with new, reusable ones. \u201cWe are also studying a way to use the coffee grounds to grow mushrooms,\u201d Ercolini added.Zero Waste Europe\u2019s Simon told IPS that he is optimistic and convinced that the Zero Waste strategy could become the standard for waste management. Indeed the EU, through the , has already established that by 2020 all European countries must stop using incinerators to burn anything that can be recycled.\u201cOur movement is nothing but the vanguard of what\u2026needs to become the norm,\u201d Simon concluded.Another splendid example of what humanity needs to be doing if we, and most life on the planet with us, is to survive.    Along with so many other splendid examples of good practice, this  is being largely ignored.     Our inertia will wind up killing us.This story includes downloadable print-quality images -- Copyright IPS, to be used exclusively with this story.IPS is an international communication institution with a global news agency at its core,\nraising the voices of the South  and civil society on issues of development, globalisation, human rights and the environment \n - \n"},

The concept of reusing is not difficult, and known to everyone, but the creation of garbage has a strange allure as the natural way to organize life. Consider two extreme examples. There is a space station circulating hundreds of kilometers over our heads, in outer space. It costs an item\u2019s weight in gold to send it up there. For example, send up 100 lbs. of food for the astronauts and that costs roughly the value of 100 lbs. of gold. Very expensive! And yet, there are all kinds of used up hard goods that THEY DISCARD! How do they \u201cget rid of\u201d their garbage? They put it into a plastic bag and give it a shove toward earth, knowing that as it enters the atmosphere it will burn up from friction and be destroyed. Sounds crazy to me.Another egregious example is at the top of the earth-world. Consider Everest, the world\u2019s highest mountain. In Tibet, a train built by the Chinese has made access easy. This article from Science reports that the number of tourists reaching Tibet in eight years from 2000 to 2018 was almost 34 million. Wow!

We love our garbage and refuse to redesign anything about it. As this article reports, the garbage accumulation reached under half a million TONS(!) that the Chinese are attempting to reduce slightly by recycling it, the least useful way to approach garbage that exists.

It can be considered to be a part of the broader  movement. It can be divided into two general approaches. Pre-consumer  fashion eliminates waste during manufacture.  zero-waste fashion generates clothing from post-consumer garments such as second-hand clothing, eliminating waste at what would normally be the end of the  of a garment. Zero-waste fashion is not a new concept - early examples of zero-waste or near zero-waste garments include , ,  and many other traditional .\nTwo general approaches fall under this category, both of which occur during a garment's initial production. In zero-waste fashion design the designer creates a garment through the pattern cutting process, working within the space of the fabric width. This approach directly influences the design of the final garment as the pattern cutting process is a primary design step. It is difficult to design a zero-waste garment solely through sketching, although sketching can be a useful speculative tool. Zero-waste manufacture, of which zero-waste design is a component, is a holistic approach that can eliminate textile waste without modifying the garment patterns.\nDesigners that have used this approach, or approaches to cutting that have an affinity with zero-waste fashion design, include\nApproaches can include the use of technology such as whole garment knitting and the relatively new DPOL a patent by designer Siddhartha Upadhyaya, but often waste is eliminated by reusing the off-cuts in other products. Designers and companies that have used these approaches include:\nA standard garment production process may begin with a drawing of the desired garment, a pattern is then generated to achieve this design, a marker is made to most efficiently use the fabric (without modifying the pattern shapes), the pattern pieces are then cut from the cloth, sewn, packed and distributed to retailers. Standard garment production generates and average of 15% textile waste due to the stratification or hierarchy of the garment production process.\nThis design approach utilises the remnants of the fashion cycle to produce new garments from second hand or surplus goods. Practitioners include:\nThe  consists of the three 'R's' - Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, in order of impact. Zero-waste fashion design eliminates pre-consumer textile waste, while not necessarily addressing waste created during the use life and disposal phase of the garment's life cycle.\n"},

The U.S.  (EPA) also cites that precycling is the preferred method of integrated  because it cuts waste at its source and therefore trash is eliminated before it is created.  According to the EPA, precycling is also characterized as a decision-making process on the behalf of the consumer because it involves making informed judgments regarding a product's waste implications. The implications that are taken into consideration by the consumer include: whether a product is , , or ; made from renewable or ; ; and whether or not the container is reusable.\nPrecycling has the ability to build industrial, social, environmental, and economic circumstances that allow for old products to be converted into new resources \nThe concept of \u2018precycling\u2019 was coined in 1988 by  executive Maureen O\u2019Rorke in a public waste education campaign for the City of Berkeley.\nThe application of precycling is not limited to large corporations, but can be administered on smaller scales in local communities. The reason precycling is effective on large scales and on small scales stems from the idea that it shares a common language between experts and non-experts, buyers and sellers, economists and environmentalists. However, it is important to consider that waste prevention systems, such as precycling, require the collaborative effort from several working parts.  These parts include prevention targets, producer responsibility, householder charging, funding for pilot projects, public involvement, engagement of private and third sectors, and public campaigns that spread awareness.\nThe original three-pronged push for  is \".\" Precycling emphasizes \"reducing and reusing\", while harnessing and questioning the momentum and popularity of the term \"recycle.\" In addition to this strategy, precycling incorporates four supplementary R's: , Recondition,  and Refuse. Waste is a resource that can be reused, recycled, recovered, or treated. Precycling differs from other singular forms of waste prevention because it encompasses not one behavior, but many.\nReduce is a form of precycling that allows for the preservation of  and also saves money on behalf of the manufacturer, the consumer, and the waste manager. Moreover, effective source reduction slows the , prolongs the life of waste management facilities, and makes combustion and  safer by removing  components.\n is a form of precycling that reinvents items after their initial life and avoids creating additional waste.\nAlthough precycling harnesses the familiarity of the term recycling, it is still important to note the difference between recycling and prevention. Since precycling focuses on the prevention of waste production, this entails that measures are taken before a substance, material, or product has become waste. Whereas recycling is a type of precycling that involves taking action before existing waste is abandoned to nature. Recycling is a process where discarded materials are collected, sorted, processed, and used in the production of new products. Every time a person engages in the act of recycling, they help increase the market and bring the cost down. However, current research from the American Plastics Council states that only 25% of the nation's recycling capabilities are being utilized.\nTraditionally  requires large amounts of energy to \"melt down\" and then re-manufacture items. While this may cut down on the amount of trash that is going into , it is not sustainable unless the underlying energy supply is sustainable. In addition, recycling often means  and always involves at least some loss of the original material, so primary extraction is still required to make up the difference. Precycling reduces these problems by using less material in the first place, so less has to be recycled.\n is a type of precycling that corrects specified faults in a product, however the quality of a repaired product is inferior to reconditioned or remanufactured items. One survey found that 68% of the respondents believed repairing was not cost efficient and sought alternative methods such as reconditioning or remanufacturing.\n is a type of precycling that requires the rebuilding of major components to restore a product's working condition, which is expected to be inferior to the original product.\n is another type of precycling that involves the greatest degree of work content, which results in superior quality of the product. In order to remanufacture a product, it requires a total dismantling of the product and the subsequent restoration and replacement of its parts. Remanufacturing is a preferred method of waste reduction compared to repairing and reconditioning because it preserves the  that has been used to shape the components of a product for their first life and it only requires 20-25% of the initial energy used in formation.\nRefusal to buy certain products due to detrimental impacts on the environment or wasteful packaging is another type of precycling because the rejection of such items paves the way for products that can be reduced, reused, or recycled.\nA  approach aims to prevent rather than just reduce accumulated waste. Zero-waste goes beyond recycling to include the whole system, which includes the flow of resources and waste through human society. This \u201cdesign principle\u201d works to maximize recycling, minimize waste, reduce consumption and ensures that products are reused, repaired or recycled back into nature or the market. This preventative approach is more manageable and effective than incremental approaches that focus on gradually reducing the amount of impact because it is less complex and contains less information, which permits wider public participation.\nIn regards to sustainability, the term itself is often associated with resource constraints and maintenance of the status quo rather than growth and prosperity. However, with the implementation of a zero-waste management strategy, sustainable practices can push the status quo in order to create a society that is capable of development, technically and culturally advanced, dynamic in population and production, thoughtful with the use of non-renewable resources, and diverse, democratic, and challenging.\nIncreased waste production is often negatively associated with increased . However, a zero-waste management strategy allows for economic growth that works cohesively with sustainability rather than against it. The implementation of a zero-waste strategy is part of an economic goal-set that aims to create a circular economy. A circular economy refers to a closed-loop socio-economic system that focuses on minimizing wastes while simultaneously maximizing stocks of resources for the economy. This closed-loop design diverts linear (open-loop) waste disposal streams into new raw material streams.\nIn a circular economy, one way to minimize waste is through the employment of precycling insurance, which allows for a full range of financed waste prevention opportunities. This type of insurance would set premiums related to the risk of a product ending up as waste, and these premiums would serve to fund actions concerning waste prevention. When establishing a premium for precycling insurance several factors need to calculated: recyclability or biodegradability; provision of infrastructure, habitat or collaborations for the generation of the product from new resources; the ecosystem concentrations of product components above natural levels. The idea of precycling insurance is plausible considering the aim of insurance industries is to avoid losses rather than paying for losses. However, in order for this idea to work, private and third sectors need to be involved and engaged in the issue. In this instance, a third sector refers to small charities and a handful of societal enterprises that coordinate with charity shops.\nAccording to the \u201cExtended Producer Responsibility\u201d principle,  impacts are substantially determined at the point of design where key decisions are made on materials, production process, and how products are used and disposed of at the end of life-cycle, which falls on the producer. However, in a circular economy there is the recognition that nature's capacity needs to be maximized through the reprocess of biodegradable wastes produced by industries and human activity. This task is accomplished through the procurement and funding of precycling insurance premiums that invest in systematic preservation of endangered habitats, careful harvesting of biological resources and expansions of productive ecosystems. Additionally, in terms of climate change, precycling insurance offers a flexible alternative to the binding limits on greenhouse gas emissions and international taxation on mineral fuels. In terms of  systems, the environment benefits from the reparation of products to the greatest degree because less energy is required and the majority of the original material is kept intact.\nThe social structure operating under a circular economy is referred to as a circular society. The aim of a circular society is to create a cooperative culture by means of problem-prevention, resource-availability and fuller participation, with reference to precycling.  One critique of this approach, in terms of waste management, is that it is difficult to maintain a cooperative culture within a society because it is constantly evolving and changing.\nThere is an increasing  on the need for  and consumption. One campaign that aimed at raising awareness of precycling focused on whether people's self-reported behaviors were affected by exposure to precycling advertisements on the radio, television, or in-store flyers. The researchers concluded that the most effective results stemmed from the inclusion of social rewards that invoke an intrinsic motivation to engage in precycling behaviors.\nAnother way to raise awareness is through statistics that highlight the potential impacts that can be achieved through waste prevention. For instance, if 70 million Americans bought a half-gallon  container of milk each week (instead of two quarts), then 41.6 million pounds of paper discards and 5.7 pounds of plastic discards would be reduced annually.  This transition from two quarts to a half-gallon would save $145.6 million on packaging each year.\nIn order to effectively implement precycling practices and behaviors, the public needs to feel \"enabled\", \"engaged\", \"encouraged\", and \"exemplified\" in their efforts to partake in precycling.\nNot only can the average consumer practice precycling, but industries can also participate. Purchasing from parts suppliers, reuse of chemicals, and reduction of unnecessary packaging are some methods. There are some companies and countries that have taken it upon themselves to implement more sustainable practices that align with precycling principles. For instance,  reduced its packaging through the implementation of bulking, reuse and redesign. Further,  created Recycle New Zealand, which provided a subsidiary focusing on the collection of materials that could be diverted and sorted prior to the operations of reducing, recycling, or recovering.  Moving forward, free-trade organizations can further implement precycling practices by exploring this strategy as a new way to reduce regulations and to promote greater industrial freedom of choice.\nMoreover, the individual consumer can develop precycling habits by engaging in the following practices and behaviors:\nEnviro-shopping is considered shopping with the environment and implements a precycling strategy: \nProducts to choose from in accordance with precycling principles:\nIn addition to shopping practices that implement precycling principles, there are also behaviors that can be undertaken to prevent waste: \n"},

Jainism offers a view that may seem readily compatible with core values associated with environmental activism, i.e., protection of life by ; which could form the basis of strong ecological ethos thus adding its voice to global calls for protection of environment. His teachings on the symbiosis between all living beings and the five elements\u2014earth, water, air, fire, and space\u2014form the basis of environmental sciences today.\nIn Europe,  of England banned the burning of  by proclamation in London in 1272, after its smoke had become a problem. The fuel was so common in England that this earliest of names for it was acquired because it could be carted away from some shores by the wheelbarrow.\nEarlier in the Middle East, the   in the 630s commanded his army to \"Bring no harm to the trees, nor burn them with fire,\" and \"Slay not any of the enemy's flock, save for your food.\"  treatises during the 9th to 13th centuries dealing with environmentalism and , including pollution, were written by , , , , , , , , , , , Ibn al-Quff, and . Their works covered a number of subjects related to pollution, such as air pollution, , ,  mishandling, and  of certain localities.\n\nAt the advent of steam and electricity the muse of history holds her nose and shuts her eyes ( 1918).The origins of the environmental movement lay in the response to increasing levels of   in the  during the . The emergence of great factories and the concomitant immense growth in  gave rise to an unprecedented level of  in industrial centers; after 1900 the large volume of industrial  discharges added to the growing load of untreated human waste. The first large-scale, modern environmental laws came in the form of Britain's , passed in 1863, to regulate the deleterious air pollution ( ) given off by the , used to produce . An Alkali inspector and four sub-inspectors were appointed to curb this pollution. The responsibilities of the inspectorate were gradually expanded, culminating in the Alkali Order 1958 which placed all major heavy industries that emitted , grit, dust and fumes under supervision.\nIn industrial cities local experts and reformers, especially after 1890, took the lead in identifying  and pollution, and initiating grass-roots movements to demand and achieve reforms. Typically the highest priority went to water and air pollution. The  was formed in 1898 making it one of the oldest environmental NGOs. It was founded by artist Sir , frustrated with the pall cast by coal smoke. Although there were earlier pieces of legislation, the  required all furnaces and fireplaces to consume their own smoke. It also provided for sanctions against factories that emitted large amounts of black smoke. The provisions of this law were extended in 1926 with the Smoke Abatement Act to include other emissions, such as soot, ash and gritty particles and to empower local authorities to impose their own regulations.\nDuring the , anarchist-controlled territories undertook several environmental reforms, which were possibly the largest in the world at the time.  notes that  would diversify crops, extend , initiate , start tree nurseries and help to establish . Once there was a link discovered between air pollution and tuberculosis, the  shut down several metal factories.\nIt was only under the impetus of the  of 1952 in London, which almost brought the city to a standstill and may have caused upward of 6,000 deaths, that the  was passed and airborne pollution in the city was first tackled. Financial incentives were offered to householders to replace open coal fires with alternatives (such as installing gas fires), or for those who preferred, to burn coke instead (a byproduct of town gas production) which produces minimal smoke. 'Smoke control areas' were introduced in some towns and cities where only smokeless fuels could be burnt and power stations were relocated away from cities. The act formed an important impetus to modern environmentalism, and caused a rethinking of the dangers of environmental degradation to people's quality of life.\nThe late 19th century also saw the passage of the first wildlife conservation laws.\nThe zoologist  published a series of investigations into the  between 1872 and 1903. His advocacy for legislation to protect animals from hunting during the mating season led to the formation of the  and influenced the passage of the  in 1869 as the first nature protection law in the world.\nEarly interest in the environment was a feature of the  in the early 19th century. One of the earliest modern pronouncements on thinking about human industrial advancement and its influence on the environment was written by Japanese geographer, educator, philosopher and author  in his 1903 publication  (). In Britain the poet  travelled extensively in the  and wrote that it is a \"sort of national property in which every man has a right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a heart to enjoy\".\nSystematic efforts on behalf of the environment only began in the late 19th century; it grew out of the amenity movement in Britain in the 1870s, which was a reaction to , the growth of cities, and worsening air and . Starting with the formation of the  in 1865, the movement championed rural preservation against the encroachments of industrialisation. , solicitor for the society, worked with , , and  to lead a successful campaign to prevent the construction of railways to carry slate from the quarries, which would have ruined the unspoilt valleys of  and . This success led to the formation of the Lake District Defence Society (later to become The Friends of the Lake District).\n wrote about ecology in , , , , criminology, urban planning, geography, geology and biology. He observed in Swiss and Siberian glaciers that they had been slowly melting since the dawn of the industrial revolution, possibly making him one of the first predictors for climate change. He also observed the damage done from deforestation and hunting. Kropotkin's writings would become influential in the 1970s and became a major inspiration for the  movement as well as his ideas becoming the basis for the theory of .\nIn 1893 Hill, Hunter and Rawnsley agreed to set up a national body to coordinate environmental conservation efforts across the country; the \"National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty\" was formally inaugurated in 1894. The organisation obtained secure footing through the 1907 National Trust Bill, which gave the trust the status of a statutory corporation. and the bill was passed in August 1907.\nAn early \"Back-to-Nature\" movement, which anticipated the romantic ideal of modern environmentalism, was advocated by intellectuals such as , ,  and , who were all against ,  and other activities that were harmful to the natural world. The movement was a reaction to the urban conditions of the industrial towns, where sanitation was awful, pollution levels intolerable and housing terribly cramped. Idealists championed the rural life as a mythical  and advocated a return to it. John Ruskin argued that people should return to a \nPractical ventures in the establishment of small cooperative farms were even attempted and old rural traditions, without the \"taint of manufacture or the canker of artificiality\", were enthusiastically revived, including the  and the .\nThese ideas also inspired various environmental groups in the UK, such as the , established in 1889 by  as a  to campaign for greater protection for the indigenous birds of the .

Thoreau was interested in peoples' relationship with nature and studied this by living close to nature in a simple life. He published his experiences in the book , which argues that people should become intimately close with nature. Muir came to believe in nature's inherent right, especially after spending time hiking in  and studying both the ecology and geology. He successfully lobbied congress to form  and went on to set up the  in 1892. The conservationist principles as well as the belief in an inherent right of nature were to become the bedrock of modern environmentalism.\nIn the 20th century, environmental ideas continued to grow in popularity and recognition. Efforts were starting to be made to save some wildlife, particularly the . The death of the last  as well as the endangerment of the American bison helped to focus the minds of conservationists and to popularise their concerns. In 1916, the  was founded by US President .\nThe  was set up in 1919 in Britain to increase the amount of woodland in Britain by buying land for  and . The commission was also tasked with promoting forestry and the production of timber for trade. During the 1920s the Commission focused on acquiring land to begin planting out new forests; much of the land was previously used for agricultural purposes. By 1939 the Forestry Commission was the largest landowner in Britain.\n\nDuring the 1930s the Nazis had elements that were supportive of animal rights, zoos and wildlife, and took several measures to ensure their protection. In 1933 the government created a stringent animal-protection law and in 1934,  (The Reich Hunting Law) was enacted which limited hunting.  (notably ), and species protection and  were significant issues in the regime. In 1935, the regime enacted the \"Reich Nature Protection Act\" (). The concept of the  (best translated as the \"perpetual forest\") which included concepts such as  and protection was promoted and efforts were also made to curb .\nIn 1949,  by  was published. It explained Leopold's belief that humankind should have moral respect for the environment and that it is unethical to harm it. The book is sometimes called the most influential book on conservation.\nThroughout the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and beyond, photography was used to enhance public awareness of the need for protecting land and recruiting members to environmental organisations. ,  and  created the Sierra Club Exhibit Format Series, which helped raise public environmental awareness and brought a rapidly increasing flood of new members to the Sierra Club and to the environmental movement in general. \"This Is Dinosaur\" edited by  with photographs by  and  prevented the building of dams within  by becoming part of a new kind of activism called environmentalism that combined the conservationist ideals of Thoreau, Leopold and Muir with hard-hitting advertising, lobbying, book distribution, letter writing campaigns, and more. The powerful use of photography in addition to the written word for conservation dated back to the creation of , when photographs persuaded Abraham Lincoln to preserve the beautiful glacier carved landscape for all time. The Sierra Club Exhibit Format Series galvanised public opposition to building dams in the  and protected many other national treasures. The Sierra Club often led a coalition of many environmental groups including the  and many others.\nAfter a focus on preserving wilderness in the 1950s and 1960s, the Sierra Club and other groups broadened their focus to include such issues as air and water pollution, population concern, and curbing the .\nIn 1962,  by American biologist  was published. The book cataloged the environmental impacts of the indiscriminate spraying of  in the US and questioned the logic of releasing large amounts of chemicals into the environment without fully understanding their effects on human health and ecology. The book suggested that DDT and other pesticides may cause  and that their agricultural use was a threat to wildlife, particularly birds. The resulting public concern led to the creation of the  in 1970 which subsequently banned the agricultural use of DDT in the US in 1972. The limited use of DDT in  control continues to this day in certain parts of the world and remains controversial. The book's legacy was to produce a far greater awareness of environmental issues and interest into how people affect the environment. With this new interest in environment came interest in problems such as air pollution and petroleum spills, and environmental interest grew. New pressure groups formed, notably  and , as well as notable local organisations such as the , which was founded in 1967.\nIn the 1970s, the environmental movement gained rapid speed around the world as a productive outgrowth of the  movement.\nThe world's first political parties to campaign on a predominantly environmental platform were the   and the  of New Zealand. The first green party in Europe was the Popular Movement for the Environment, founded in 1972 in the Swiss canton of . The first national green party in Europe was PEOPLE, founded in Britain in February 1973, which eventually turned into the , and then the .\nProtection of the environment also became important in the ; the  was formed in India under the influence of  and they set up peaceful resistance to  by literally hugging trees (leading to the term \"tree huggers\").

Earth Day was first observed in San Francisco and other cities on 21 March 1970, the first day of spring. It was created to give awareness to environmental issues. On 21 March 1971, United Nations Secretary-General U Thant spoke of a  on Earth Day, hereby referring to the  the earth supplies to us, and hence our obligation to protect it (and with it, ourselves). Earth Day is now coordinated globally by the , and is celebrated in more than 192 countries every year.\nThe UN's first major conference on international environmental issues, the  (also known as the Stockholm Conference), was held on 5\u201316 June 1972. It marked a turning point in the development of international environmental politics.\nBy the mid-1970s, many felt that people were on the edge of environmental catastrophe.

Because of these divisions, the environmental movement can be categorized into these primary focuses: , environmental activism, environmental advocacy, and .\nFree market environmentalism is a theory that argues that the , , and  law provide the best tools to preserve the health and  of the environment.

While the movement has focused on different environmental issues, it is best known for its focus of addressing climate action from a biblically grounded  perspective. This movement is controversial among some non-Christian environmentalists due to its rooting in a specific religion.\nEnvironmental preservation in the United States and other parts of the world, including Australia, is viewed as the setting aside of natural resources to prevent damage caused by contact with humans or by certain human activities, such as logging, mining, hunting, and fishing, often to replace them with new human activities such as tourism and recreation. Regulations and laws may be enacted for the preservation of natural resources.\nEnvironmental organisations can be global, regional, national or local; they can be government-run or private (). Environmentalist activity exists in almost every country. Moreover, groups dedicated to community development and social justice also focus on environmental concerns.\nSome US environmental organisations, among them the  and the , specialise in bringing lawsuits (a tactic seen as particularly useful in that country). Other groups, such as the US-based , , , , and , and global groups like the  and , disseminate information, participate in , , , and may purchase land for . Statewide nonprofit organisations such as the  often collaborate with these national organisations and employ similar strategies. Smaller groups, including , conduct research on  and . More radical organisations, such as , , and the , have more directly opposed actions they regard as environmentally harmful. While Greenpeace is devoted to nonviolent confrontation as a means of bearing witness to environmental wrongs and bringing issues into the public realm for debate, the underground  engages in the clandestine destruction of property, the release of caged or penned animals, and other criminal acts. Such tactics are regarded as unusual within the movement, however.\nOn an international level, concern for the environment was the subject of a  in Stockholm in 1972, attended by 114 nations. Out of this meeting developed  () and the follow-up  in 1992. Other international organisations in support of environmental policies development include the  (as part of ), the  (EEA), and the  (IPCC).\nNotable environmental protests and campaigns include:\nNotable advocates for  and  include:\nEvery year, more than 100 environmental activists are murdered throughout the world.

One can also regard oneself as an environmentalist and believe that human 'interference' with 'nature' should be . Nevertheless, there is a risk that the shift from emotional environmentalism into the technical management of natural resources and hazards could decrease the touch of humans with nature, leading to less concern with environment preservation.\n Quotations related to  at Wikiquote\n Media related to  at Wikimedia Commons\n"},

Vancouver is among British Columbia's youngest cities; the first European settlement in what is now Vancouver was not until 1862 at McCleery's Farm on the Fraser River, just east of the ancient village of  in what is now . A sawmill established at Moodyville (now the ) in 1863, began the city's long relationship with logging. It was quickly followed by mills owned by Captain Edward Stamp on the south shore of the inlet. Stamp, who had begun logging in the  area, first attempted to run a mill at , but difficult currents and reefs forced the relocation of the operation in 1867 to a point near the foot of Dunlevy Street. This mill, known as the , became the nucleus around which Vancouver formed. The mill's central role in the city waned after the arrival of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) in the 1880s. It nevertheless remained important to the local economy until it closed in the 1920s. The settlement, which came to be called Gastown, grew quickly around the original makeshift tavern established by \"Gassy\"  in 1867 on the edge of the Hastings Mill property.\nIn 1870, the  surveyed the settlement and laid out a townsite, renamed \"Granville\" in honour of the then-British , . This site, with its natural harbour, was selected in 1884 as the terminus for the Canadian Pacific Railway, to the disappointment of ,  and , all of which had vied to be the railhead.

While some manufacturing did develop, including the establishment of the British Columbia Sugar Refinery by  in 1890, natural resources became the basis for Vancouver's economy. The resource sector was initially based on logging and later on exports moving through the seaport, where commercial traffic constituted the largest economic sector in Vancouver by the 1930s.\nThe dominance of the economy by big business was accompanied by an often militant . The first major sympathy strike was in 1903 when railway employees struck against the CPR for union recognition. Labour leader Frank Rogers was killed by CPR police while picketing at the docks, becoming the movement's first martyr in British Columbia. The rise of industrial tensions throughout the province led to Canada's first general strike in 1918, at the  coal mines on .

Two of the claimants were  manufacturers, and after further investigation, King found that white women were reportedly frequenting  as well as  men. A federal law banning the manufacture, sale, and importation of opium for non-medicinal purposes was soon passed based on these revelations.

These fears were exacerbated by the  leading to the eventual  or deportation of all Japanese-Canadians living in the city and the province.

Less than a year later, the Westminster and Vancouver Tramway Company began operating Canada's first interurban line between the two cities (extended to  in 1910). Another line (1902), the Vancouver and Lulu Island Railway, was leased by the Canadian Pacific Railway to the British Columbia Electric Railway in 1905 and ran from the Granville Street Bridge to  via , which encouraged residential neighbourhoods outside the central core to develop. From 1897 the  (BCER) became the company that operated the urban and , until 1958, when its last vestiges were dismantled in favour of \"trackless\"  and gasoline/diesel ; in that same year the BCER became the core of the newly created, publicly owned . Vancouver currently has the second-largest  fleet in North America, after .\nSuccessive city councils in the 1970s and 1980s prohibited the construction of freeways as part of a long-term plan. As a result, the only major freeway within city limits is , which passes through the north-eastern corner of the city. While the number of cars in Vancouver proper has been steadily rising with population growth, the rate of car ownership and the average distance driven by daily commuters have fallen since the early 1990s. Vancouver is the only major Canadian city with these trends. Despite the fact that the journey time per vehicle has increased by one-third and growing traffic mass, there are 7% fewer cars making trips into the downtown core. In 2012, Vancouver had the worst traffic congestion in  and the second-highest in , behind . As of 2013, Vancouver now has the worst traffic congestion in North America. Residents have been more inclined to live in areas closer to their interests, or use more energy-efficient means of travel, such as mass transit and cycling. This is, in part, the result of a push by city planners for a solution to traffic problems and pro-environment campaigns.  policies have imposed restrictions on drivers making it more difficult and expensive to commute while introducing more benefits for non-drivers.\n is responsible for roads and public transportation within  (in succession to , which had taken over the transit functions of BC Hydro).

The city benefits from being located close to the mountains as hydroelectric generating stations provide 93 percent of the electricity by using falling water without emitting any greenhouse gases or polluting the air. The city is also actively working towards becoming a greener city. The City of Vancouver has crafted an action plan of goals it has set to meet by 2020, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, encouraging the growth of green jobs and businesses, requiring green construction, and reducing waste.\nThe  (GCAP) is a City of Vancouver urban sustainability initiative. Its primary mission is to ensure that Vancouver becomes the greenest city in the world by the year 2020. The GCAP originated based on the 2009 work of the Greenest City Action Team, a committee co-chaired by Vancouver mayor . The GCAP was approved by Vancouver city council in July 2011.\nIn May 2018, the  2040 Strategy passed Vancouver's city council.

Wastes may be generated during the extraction of raw materials, the processing of raw materials into intermediate and final products, the consumption of final products, and other human activities. Residuals recycled or reused at the place of generation are excluded.\"\nUnder the , Art. 3(1), the  defines waste as \"an object the holder discards, intends to discard or is required to discard.\"  For a more structural description of the Waste Directive, see the .\nThere are many waste types defined by modern systems of , notably including:\nThere are many issues that surround reporting waste. It is most commonly measured by size or weight, and there is a stark difference between the two. For example,  is much heavier when it is wet, and plastic or glass bottles can have different weights but be the same size. On a global scale it is difficult to report waste because countries have different definitions of waste and what falls into waste categories, as well as different ways of reporting. Based on incomplete reports from its parties, the  estimated 338 million tonnes of waste was generated in 2001. For the same year, OECD estimated 4 billion tonnes from its member countries. Despite these inconsistencies, waste reporting is still useful on a small and large scale to determine key causes and locations, and to find ways of preventing, minimizing, recovering, treating, and disposing waste.\n\nInappropriately managed waste can attract rodents and insects, which  can harbour gastrointestinal parasites, yellow fever, worms, the plague and other conditions for humans, and exposure to hazardous wastes, particularly when they are burned, can cause various other diseases including cancers.  materials can contaminate surface water, groundwater, soil, and air which causes more problems for humans, other species, and ecosystems. Waste treatment and disposal produces significant green house gas (GHG) emissions, notably methane, which are contributing significantly to .\nWaste management is a significant  issue. Many of the environmental burdens cited above are more often borne by marginalized groups, such as racial minorities, women, and residents of developing nations.  (not in my back yard) is the opposition of residents to a proposal for a new development because it is close to them. However, the need for expansion and siting of waste treatment and disposal facilities is increasing worldwide. There is now a growing market in the transboundary movement of waste, and although most waste that flows between countries goes between developed nations, a significant amount of waste is moved from developed to developing nations.\nThe economic costs of managing waste are high, and are often paid for by municipal governments; money can often be saved with more efficiently designed collection routes, modifying vehicles, and with public education. Environmental policies such as  can reduce the cost of management and reduce waste quantities. Waste recovery (that is, , ) can curb economic costs because it avoids extracting raw materials and often cuts transportation costs. \"Economic assessment of municipal waste management systems \u2013 case studies using a combination of  (LCA) and  (LCC)\". The location of waste treatment and disposal facilities often reduces property values due to noise, dust, pollution, unsightliness, and negative stigma. The informal waste sector consists mostly of  who scavenge for metals, glass, plastic, textiles, and other materials and then trade them for a profit. This sector can significantly alter or reduce waste in a particular system, but other negative economic effects come with the disease, poverty, exploitation, and abuse of its workers.\nResource recovery is the retrieval of recyclable waste, which was intended for disposal, for a specific next use.  It is the processing of recyclables to extract or recover materials and resources, or convert to energy.  This process is carried out at a resource recovery facility.  Resource recovery is not only important to the environment, but it can be cost effective by decreasing the amount of waste sent to the disposal stream, reduce the amount of space needed for landfills, and protect limited natural resources.\n from waste is using non-recyclable waste materials and extracting from it heat, electricity, or energy through a variety of processes, including , , , and . This process is referred to as .\nThere are several ways to recover energy from waste.

Secondary recovered fuel is the energy recovery from waste that cannot be reused or recycled from mechanical and biological treatment activities.  Pyrolysis involves heating of waste, with the absence of oxygen, to high temperatures to break down any carbon content into a mixture of gaseous and liquid fuels and solid residue. Gasification is the conversion of carbon rich material through high temperature with partial oxidation into a gas stream.   heating is the very high heating of municipal solid waste to temperatures ranging from 3,000-10,000\u00a0\u00b0C, where energy is released by an electrical discharge in an .\nUsing waste as fuel can offer important environmental benefits.  It can provide a safe and  option for wastes that would normally have to be dealt with through disposal. It can help reduce carbon dioxide emissions by diverting energy use from fossil fuels, while also generating energy and using waste as fuel can reduce the  generated in landfills by averting waste from landfills.\nThere is some debate in the classification of certain biomass feedstock as wastes. Crude Tall Oil (CTO), a co-product of the  process, is  defined as a waste or residue in some European countries when in fact it is produced \u201con purpose\u201d and has significant value add potential in industrial applications.

This process  various  otherwise regarded as waste products and produces a  (the ).\nCompost is rich in nutrients. It is used, for example, in , , ,  and . The compost itself is beneficial for the land in many ways, including as a soil conditioner, a , addition of vital  or , and as a natural  for soil.  for erosion control, land and stream reclamation, wetland construction, and as landfill cover.\nAt the simplest level, the process of composting requires making a heap of wet organic matter (also called ), such as leaves, grass, and food scraps, and waiting for the materials to break down into  after a period of months. However, composting can also take place as a multi-step, closely monitored process with measured inputs of water, air, and carbon- and nitrogen-rich materials. The  process is aided by shredding the plant matter, adding water and ensuring proper aeration by regularly turning the mixture when open piles or \"windrows\" are used. ,  and other  further break up the material.  and fungi manage the chemical process by converting the inputs into heat, , and .\nComposting is an  (meaning that it requires the presence of air) of decomposing organic solid wastes. It can therefore be used to recycle organic material. The process involves decomposition of organic material into a -like material, known as compost, which is a good  for plants. Composting requires the following three components: human management, aerobic conditions, and development of internal biological heat.\nComposting organisms require four equally important ingredients to work effectively:\nCertain ratios of these materials will provide microorganisms to work at a rate that will heat up the pile. Active management of the pile (e.g. turning) is needed to maintain sufficient supply of oxygen and the right moisture level. The air/water balance is critical to maintaining high temperatures 130\u2013160\u00a0\u00b0F (54\u201371\u00a0\u00b0C) until the materials are broken down.\nThe most efficient composting occurs with an optimal carbon:nitrogen ratio of about 25:1.  focuses on retaining the heat to increase decomposition rate and produce compost more quickly. Rapid composting is favored by having a C/N ratio of ~30 or less. Above 30 the substrate is nitrogen starved, below 15 it is likely to outgas a portion of nitrogen as ammonia.\nNearly all plant and animal materials have both carbon and nitrogen, but amounts vary widely, with characteristics noted above (dry/wet, brown/green). Fresh grass clippings have an average ratio of about 15:1 and dry autumn leaves about 50:1 depending on species. Mixing equal parts by volume approximates the ideal C:N range. Few individual situations will provide the ideal mix of materials at any point. Observation of amounts, and consideration of different materials as a pile is built over time, can quickly achieve a workable technique for the individual situation.\nWith the proper mixture of water, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen, micro-organisms are able to break down organic matter to produce compost. The composting process is dependent on micro-organisms to break down organic matter into compost. There are many types of microorganisms found in active compost of which the most common are:\nIn addition,  not only ingest partly composted material, but also continually re-create aeration and drainage tunnels as they move through the compost.\nUnder ideal conditions, composting proceeds through three major phases:\nThere are many proponents of rapid composting that attempt to correct some of the perceived problems associated with traditional, slow composting. Many advocate that compost can be made in 2 to 3 weeks. Many such short processes involve a few changes to traditional methods, including smaller, more homogenized pieces in the compost, controlling carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C:N) at 30 to 1 or less, and monitoring the moisture level more carefully. However, none of these parameters differ significantly from the early writings of compost researchers, suggesting that, in fact, modern composting has not made significant advances over the traditional methods that take a few months to work. For this reason and others, many scientists who deal with carbon transformations are skeptical that there is a \"super-charged\" way to get nature to make compost rapidly.\nBoth sides may be right to some extent. The bacterial activity in rapid high heat methods breaks down the material to the extent that pathogens and seeds are destroyed, and the original feedstock is unrecognizable. At this stage, the compost can be used to prepare fields or other planting areas.  However, most professionals recommend that the compost be given time to cure before using in a nursery for starting seeds or growing young plants. The curing time allows fungi to continue the decomposition process and eliminating  substances.\nAn alternative approach is anaerobic fermentation, known as . It retains carbon bonds, is faster than decomposition, and for application to soil requires only rapid but thorough aeration rather than curing. It depends on sufficient carbohydrates in the treated material.\nComposting can destroy  or unwanted . Unwanted living plants (or ) can be discouraged by . The \"\" in compost may include  and .\nThermophilic (high-temperature) composting is well known to destroy many seeds and nearly all types of pathogens (exceptions may include ).

It can  an unwanted by-product from another process (a ) into a useful new product.\nComposting is a process for converting decomposable organic materials into useful stable products. Therefore, valuable  space can be used for other wastes by composting these materials rather than dumping them on landfills. It may however be difficult to control inert and plastics contamination from .\nCo-composting is a technique that processes organic solid waste together with other input materials such as dewatered  or .\nIndustrial composting systems are being installed to treat organic solid waste and recycle it rather than landfilling it. It is one example of an . Mechanical sorting of mixed waste streams combined with  digestion or in-vessel composting is called . It is increasingly being used in developed countries due to regulations controlling the amount of organic matter allowed in landfills. Treating  before it enters a landfill reduces  from fugitive ; untreated waste breaks down anaerobically in a landfill, producing  that contains , a potent .\nOn many farms, the basic composting ingredients are animal  generated on the farm and bedding. Straw and sawdust are common bedding materials. Non-traditional bedding materials are also used, including newspaper and chopped cardboard. The amount of manure composted on a livestock farm is often determined by cleaning schedules, land availability, and weather conditions. Each type of manure has its own physical, chemical, and biological characteristics. Cattle and horse manures, when mixed with bedding, possess good qualities for composting. Swine manure, which is very wet and usually not mixed with bedding material, must be mixed with straw or similar raw materials. Poultry manure also must be blended with carbonaceous materials - those low in nitrogen preferred, such as sawdust or straw.\n can  be added as an input to the composting process since human excreta is a nitrogen-rich organic material. It can be either composted directly, as in , or indirectly (as ), after it has undergone treatment in a .  Feces contain a wide range of microorganisms including bacteria, viruses and parasitic worms and its use in home composting can pose significant health risks.\n can be put on compost piles or directly used as fertilizer. Adding urine to compost can increase temperatures and therefore increase its ability to destroy pathogens and unwanted seeds. Unlike feces, urine does not attract disease-spreading flies (such as  or ), and it does not contain the most hardy of pathogens, such as  eggs.\nCompost can be used as an additive to soil, or other matrices such as  and , as a  improver, supplying humus and nutrients. It provides a rich  as absorbent material (porous). This material contains moisture and soluble minerals, which provides support and . Although it is rarely used alone, plants can flourish from mixed , , grit, bark chips, , , or  granules to produce . Compost can be tilled directly into the soil or growing medium to boost the level of organic matter and the overall fertility of the soil. Compost that is ready to be used as an additive is dark brown or even black with an earthy smell.\nGenerally, direct seeding into a compost is not recommended due to the speed with which it may dry and the possible presence of  in immature compost that may inhibit germination, and the possible tie up of nitrogen by incompletely decomposed lignin. It is very common to see blends of 20\u201330% compost used for transplanting  at  stage or later.\nCompost can be used to increase plant immunity to diseases and pests.\nVarious approaches have been developed to handle different ingredients, locations, throughput and applications for the composted product.\nIndustrial-scale composting can be carried out in the form of , , , or .\n is the product or process of organic material degradation using various species of worms, usually , , and , to create a heterogeneous mixture of decomposing vegetable or food waste (excluding meat, dairy, fats, or oils), bedding materials, and vermicast. Vermicast, also known as , worm humus or worm manure, is the end-product of the breakdown of organic matter by  of earthworm.\nVermicomposting can also be applied for  .\nA  collects human excreta. These are added to a compost heap that can be located in a chamber below the toilet seat.  and straw or other carbon rich materials are usually added as well. Some  do not require water or electricity; others may. If they do not use water for flushing they fall into the category of . Some composting toilet designs use , others do not. When properly managed, they do not smell. The composting process in these toilets destroys pathogens to some extent. The amount of pathogen destruction depends on the temperature (mesophilic or thermophilic conditions) and composting time.\nComposting toilets with a large composting container (of the type  and derivations of it) are popular in United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Sweden. They are available as commercial products, as designs for self builders or as \"design derivatives\" which are marketed under various names.\n () larvae are able to rapidly consume large amounts of organic material when kept at around 30\u00a0\u00b0C. Black soldier fly larvae can reduce the dry matter of the organic waste by 73%  and convert 16\u201322% of the dry matter in the waste to biomass. The resulting compost still contains nutrients and can be used for  production, or further traditional composting or   The larvae are rich in fat and protein, and can be used as, for example, animal feed or  production. Enthusiasts have experimented with a large number of different waste products.\nBokashi is not composting as defined earlier, rather an alternative technology. It  (rather than decomposes) the input organic matter and feeds the result to the  (rather than producing a soil conditioner). The process involves adding  to the input in an airtight container kept at normal room temperature. These bacteria ferment  to , which preserves the input. After this is complete the preserve is mixed into soil, converting the lactic acid to , which enables soil life to consume the result.\n\nBokashi is typically applied to  from households, workplaces and catering establishments, because such waste normally holds a good proportion of carbohydrates; it is also applied to other organic waste by supplementing carbohydrates. Household containers (\"bokashi bins\") typically give a batch size of 5\u201310 kilograms (11\u201322\u00a0lb), accumulated over a few weeks. In horticultural settings batches can be orders of magnitude greater.Bokashi offers several advantages:\nThe importance of the first advantage should not be underestimated: the mass of any  depends on the energy it captures. Plants depend upon the soil ecosystem making nutrients available within . Therefore, the richer the ecosystem, the richer the plants. (Plants can also take up nutrients from added chemicals, but these are at odds with the purpose of composting).\nThe practice of making raised garden beds or mounds filled with rotting wood is also called  in German. It is in effect creating a  that is covered with soil.\nBenefits of  garden beds include water retention and warming of soil. Buried wood acts like a  as it decomposes, able to capture water and store it for later use by crops planted on top of the  bed.\nCompost teas are defined as water extracts leached from composted materials. Compost teas are generally produced from adding one volume of compost to 4\u201310 volumes of water, but there has also been debate about the benefits of aerating the mixture. Field studies have shown the benefits of adding compost teas to crops due to the adding of organic matter, increased nutrient availability and increased microbial activity. They have also been shown to have an effect on plant pathogens.\nWorm Hotels accommodate useful worm in ideal conditions.\nOrganic ingredients intended for composting can also be used to generate  through . This process stabilizes organic material. The residual material, sometimes in combination with  can be treated by a composting process before selling or giving away the compost.\nThere are process and product guidelines in Europe that date to the early 1980s (Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland) and only more recently in the UK and the US. In both these countries, private trade associations within the industry have established loose standards, some say as a stop-gap measure to discourage independent government agencies from establishing tougher consumer-friendly standards.\nThe USA is the only Western country that does not distinguish sludge-source compost from green-composts, and by default in the USA 50% of states expect composts to comply in some manner with the federal EPA 503 rule promulgated in 1984 for sludge products.\nCompost is regulated in Canada and Australia as well.\nMany countries such as  and some individual cities such as Seattle and  require food and yard waste to be sorted for composting ().\nLarge-scale composting systems are used by many urban areas around the world.\nComposting as a recognized practice dates to at least the early Roman Empire, and was mentioned as early as 's 160 BCE piece . Traditionally, composting involved piling organic materials until the next planting season, at which time the materials would have decayed enough to be ready for use in the soil. The advantage of this method is that little working time or effort is required from the composter and it fits in naturally with agricultural practices in temperate climates. Disadvantages (from the modern perspective) are that space is used for a whole year, some nutrients might be leached due to exposure to rainfall, and disease-producing organisms and insects may not be adequately controlled.\nComposting was somewhat modernized beginning in the 1920s in Europe as a tool for . The first industrial station for the transformation of urban organic materials into compost was set up in , Austria in the year 1921. Early frequent citations for propounding composting within farming are for the German-speaking world , founder of a farming method called , and , who was appointed on behalf of the government in  and supported the country 1950\u20131958 to set up a large humus organization in the fight against erosion and .\nIn the English-speaking world it was  who worked extensively in  on sustainable practices and  who was a huge proponent of composting. Composting was imported to America by various followers of these early European movements by the likes of  (founder of Rodale Organic Gardening), E.E. Pfeiffer (who developed scientific practices in biodynamic farming),  (founder of Walnut Acres in Pennsylvania), and  and  (who inspired the  of the 1960s). Coincidentally, some of the above met briefly in India - all were quite influential in the U.S. from the 1960s into the 1980s.\nThe term \"composting\" is used worldwide with differing meanings.\n\"Humanure\" is a  of  and , designating human excrement ( and ) that is recycled via composting for agricultural purposes. The term was first used in 1994 in a book by Joseph Jenkins that advocates the use of this  soil amendment. The term humanure is used by compost enthusiasts in the United States but not widely used elsewhere. Because the term \"humanure\" has no authoritative definition it is subject to various uses. News reporters may use the term also for  or .\n"},

To be sustainable, waste management cannot be solved only with technical end-of-pipe solutions and an integrated approach is necessary.\nThe  indicates an order of preference for action to reduce and manage waste, and is usually presented diagrammatically in the form of a pyramid. The hierarchy captures the progression of a material or product through successive stages of , and represents the latter part of the .\nThe aim of the waste hierarchy is to extract the maximum practical benefits from products and to generate the minimum amount of waste.

It involves looking at all stages of a product's life to find where improvements can be made to reduce environmental impacts and improve the use or  of resources.  A key goal is to avoid actions that shift negative impacts from one stage to another.  Life cycle thinking can be applied to the five stages of the waste management hierarchy.\nFor example, life-cycle analysis has shown that it is often better for the environment to replace an old washing machine, despite the waste generated, than to continue to use an older machine which is less . This is because a washing machine's greatest environmental impact is during its use phase. Buying an energy-efficient machine and using low- temperature detergent reduce environmental impacts.\nThe European Union Waste Framework Directive has introduced the concept of life-cycle thinking into waste policies.  This duality approach gives a broader view of all environmental aspects and ensures any action has an overall benefit compared to other options.  The actions to deal with waste along the hierarchy should be compatible with other environmental initiatives.\nThe  refers to the 5 steps included in the article 4 of the :\nAccording to the  the European Waste Hierarchy is legally binding except in cases that may require specific waste streams to depart from the hierarchy. This should be justified on the basis of life-cycle thinking.\nThe waste hierarchy is a concept that has appeared in environmental literature and in some EU member-states environmental legislation but before the  of 2008 was not part of the European legislation. The waste framework directive of 1975 had no reference to a waste hierarchy. \nIn 1975, The European Union's  (1975/442/EEC) introduced for the first time the elements of the waste hierarchy concept into European waste policy. It emphasized the importance of , and the  and , as a priority. Following the 1975 Directive, European Union policy and legislation adapted to the principles of the waste hierarchy.\nA fundament to the waste hierarchy concept is known as 'Lansink's Ladder', named after the Member of the Dutch Parliament who proposed it in 1979 to be incorporated into Dutch policy in 1993.\nIn 1989, it was formalized into a hierarchy of management options in the European Commission's Community Strategy for Waste Management and this waste strategy was further endorsed in the Commission's review in 1996.\nIn the first legislative proposals of 2006 the  suggested a 3-step hierarchy composed of 1- Prevention and Reuse, 2- Recycling and Recovery (with ) and 3- Disposal. This was heavily criticised because it was putting recycling at the same level of incineration which was coherent with the traditional pro-incineration position from the European Commission. The pressure from NGOs and member states managed to turn the initial non-binding 3 step hierarchy into a quasi-binding 5 step hierarchy.\nIn 2008, the European Union introduced a new  to its waste legislation, Directive 2008/98/EC, which member states must introduce into national waste management laws. Article 4 of the directive lays down a five-step hierarchy of waste management options which must be applied by Member States in this priority order.  Waste prevention, as the preferred option, is followed by reuse, recycling, recovery including  and as a last option, safe disposal. Among engineers, a similar hierarchy of waste management has been known as ARRE strategy: avoid, reduce, recycle, eliminate.\nThe task of implementing the waste hierarchy in waste management practices within a country may be delegated to the different levels of government (national, regional, local) and to other possible factors including industry, private companies and households. Local and regional authorities can be particularly challenged by the following issues when applying the waste hierarchy approach. \n involves efforts to reduce  and other materials by modifying industrial production. Source reduction methods involve changes in manufacturing technology,  inputs, and product formulation. At times, the term \"pollution prevention\" may refer to source reduction.\nAnother method of source reduction is to increase incentives for recycling.  Many communities in the United States are implementing  for waste disposal (also known as Pay As You Throw - ) which has been effective in reducing the size of the  stream.\nSource reduction is typically measured by efficiencies and cutbacks in waste.  is a more controversial approach to source reduction that targets and measures reductions in the upstream use of toxic materials. Toxics use reduction emphasizes the more preventive aspects of source reduction but, due to its emphasis on toxic chemical inputs, has been opposed more vigorously by chemical manufacturers. Toxics use reduction programs have been set up by legislation in some states, e.g., , , and . The 3 R's represent the 'Waste Hierarchy' which lists the best ways of managing waste from the most to the least desirable.

() 02:59, 11 November 2007 (UTC)\nAs the inventor and developer of the name and concepts of Zero Waste as reported in the article, I am dismayed by the turn the article has taken. Simple recycling concepts and misapplied attention to reducing dumping have become equated to Zero Waste even though the more theoretical treatment states clearly that Zero Waste is more than just recycling or keeping trash out of dumps. In other words, the principles are stated, then ignored as the article proceeds and the concept of Zero Waste is then downgraded and contaminated with now discredited concepts. Zero Waste is a design principle, it is not a waste management technique as suggested in some parts of the article. It makes no sense to state that Zero Waste is not about scrambling to recycle after discard and then tout putative Zero Waste successes as no more than recycling or garbage reduction. It is also important, and completely overlooked, that not every group and every plan that claims to be about Zero Waste is actually on that subject. Most in fact are about recycling, pure and simple, and make no practical reference to redesign.\nComing back in November 2010, I have refined the application of ZW to actual processes. I have reluctantly left many of the misleading discussions of ZW added by recyclers who care nothing for the distinction between ZW and recycling. It seems to me that there is an article on recycling which people should go to if they want information on that subject. ZW is a different topic and this article should not be treated as an extension of the recycling article. Also, there are many misunderstandings and erroneous interpretations that permeate the discussion. If ZW is a design principle to avoid discard, it cannot be discussed in a context of reusing waste products. That is the domain of the recycler. It cannot be discussed as a way to reduce the amount of garbage going to dumps. Dumps and garbage are not the measures of ZW. Success in eliminating discard is the measure of ZW and if that reduces garbage than so be it but dumps are not part of the high design of any society. They are only a measure of the failure of a society to design its products and operations in conformity with living as lightly on the planet as possible.\nBy misinterpreting ZW as a subset of the recycling movement, the other editors have deprived the public of the recognition that here is a concept which is far more insightful than the primitive concepts of recycling. The writing thus cloaks the unique contribution that Zero Waste makes to environmental theory by dumbing Zero Waste down to the level of the local dump.\nIn a spirit of editorial collegiality, I have not at this time eliminated those misleading interpretations.\nIt would be good to add in some references to concepts, regulations and the like but the field is vast, with literally millions of potential links to the many topics touched on. It is a daunting task to pick out a reasonable number.\n\nPaul Palmer -  () 07:44, 21 March 2009 (UTC)\nIn general, I find editing to be an almost impossible task unless I limit myself to the simplest of textual additions and changes. The Manual of Style (while interesting and on the mark) is so long that all I can do with it is skim, ponder and hope some residue remains long after. The details of how to accomplish links and references and footnotes etc. etc. are utterly beyond me. Why can't there be a permanent menu while you are editing that you can click on to get a thumbnail of how to put in a link or a punctuation mark or a box or a reference (okay, tell me there is and I never noticed it).

There was no [edit] button for it that I could see so I went to the very top of the page where it says Edit This Page.

I found this infuriating because I emphatically did NOT ask to download any file and I DO NOT want to save it and I have no idea of why this happened. I thought it could be a phishing attempt so I closed the download but it comes up every time. \nFor a program that is supposed to be open to the world to contribute edits to, this software seems to be the main obstacle.

RISE then transferred the project to a newly founded nonprofit organization, the Freecycle Network, whose executive director, Deron Beal, was the initial project leader. Beal originated the first Freecycle email group for Tucson residents. In February 2005, TFN accepted $130,000 from  to help build out the website and the network.\nOver time, the concept has spread to over 110 countries, with thousands of local groups and millions of members.\nThe organization began as a collection of  linked from freecycle.org. It has become a web-community platform on freecycle.org for all groups, which are run by local volunteers. TFN encourages the formation of new groups, subject to approval by regional new-group approvers. Groups approved by TFN are listed on the website, can use the TFN name and logo, and are subject to rules which are enforced by a network of global and regional group outreach assistance. As of March 2009, all new groups had to join freecycle.org's new-group system, which provides Freecycle-specific tools for local volunteer moderators and gives TFN oversight of individual groups. As of 2015, all local groups are listed on freecycle.org.\nTFN has a global organization of over 4,000 local chapters, and passed the two-million-member mark in February 2006.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_waste", "title": "RadioactivewasteWikipedia", "body": " is a type of  that contains . Radioactive waste is a  of various  processes. Industries generating radioactive waste include , , , manufacturing, construction, coal and  and  reprocessing. Radioactive waste is regulated by government agencies in order to protect human health and the environment.\nIn modern nuclear plants over 96% of  is recycled back into uranium-based and . Radioactivity of the remaining 4%  naturally decreases over time, so it has to be isolated and confined in appropriate disposal facilities for a sufficient period until it no longer poses a threat. The time radioactive waste must be stored for depends on the type of waste and radioactive isotopes. Current approaches to radioactive waste storage have been segregation and storage for short-lived waste, near-surface disposal for low and some intermediate-level waste, and burial in a  or  for the high-level waste. \nA summary of the amounts of radioactive waste and management approaches for most developed countries are presented and reviewed periodically as part of the  (IAEA) . \nRadioactive waste typically comprises a number of : unstable configurations of elements that , emitting  which is harmful to humans and the environment. These isotopes emit different types and levels of radiation, which last for different periods of time.\nThe radioactivity of all radioactive waste weakens with time. All  contained in the waste have a  \u2014 the time it takes for half of the atoms to decay into another  \u2014 and eventually, all radioactive waste decays into non-radioactive elements (i.e., ). Since radioactive decay follows the half-life rule, the rate of decay is inversely proportional to the duration of decay. In other words, the radiation from a long-lived isotope like  will be much less intense than that of a short-lived isotope like . The two tables show some of the major radioisotopes, their half-lives, and their  as a proportion of the yield of fission of uranium-235.\nThe energy and the type of the  emitted by a radioactive substance are also important factors in determining its threat to humans. The chemical properties of the radioactive  will determine how mobile the substance is and how likely it is to spread into the environment and  humans. This is further complicated by the fact that many radioisotopes do not decay immediately to a stable state but rather to radioactive  within a  before ultimately reaching a stable state.\nNo fission products\nhave a half-life\nin the range of\n100\u2013210\u00a0k years ...\n... nor beyond 15.7\u00a0M years\n for superscript symbols\n\u20a1\u00a0 has thermal  cross section in the range of 8\u201350 barns\n\u0192\u00a0 \nm\u00a0 \n\u2116\u00a0 primarily a  (NORM)\n\u00fe\u00a0  (thermal neutron capture cross section greater than 3k barns)\n\u2020\u00a0 range 4\u201397\u00a0y: \n\u2021\u00a0 over 200,000\u00a0y: \nExposure to radioactive waste may cause health impacts due to ionizing radiation exposure. In , a dose of 1  carries a 5.5% risk of developing cancer, and regulatory agencies  even for low doses. Ionizing radiation can cause deletions in chromosomes. If a developing organism such as a  is irradiated, it is possible a  may be induced, but it is unlikely this defect will be in a  or a gamete-forming . The incidence of radiation-induced mutations in humans is small, as in most mammals, because of natural cellular-repair mechanisms, many just now coming to light. These mechanisms range from DNA,  and protein repair, to internal lysosomic digestion of defective proteins, and even induced cell suicide\u2014apoptosis\nDepending on the decay mode and the   (how the body processes it and how quickly), the threat due to exposure to a given activity of a  will differ. For instance  is a short-lived  and  emitter, but because it concentrates in the  gland, it is more able to cause injury than -137 which, being , is rapidly excreted through urine. In a similar way, the  emitting actinides and  are considered very harmful as they tend to have long  and their radiation has a high , making it far more damaging to tissues per amount of energy deposited. Because of such differences, the rules determining biological injury differ widely according to the radioisotope, time of exposure\nand sometimes also the nature of the chemical compound which contains the radioisotope.\nRadioactive waste comes from a number of sources. In countries with nuclear power plants, nuclear armament, or nuclear fuel treatment plants, the majority of waste originates from the nuclear fuel cycle and nuclear weapons reprocessing. Other sources include medical and industrial wastes, as well as naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM) that can be concentrated as a result of the processing or consumption of coal, oil and gas, and some minerals, as discussed below.\nWaste from the front end of the  is usually alpha-emitting waste from the extraction of uranium. It often contains radium and its decay products.\n (UO) concentrate from mining is a thousand or so times as radioactive as the  used in buildings. It is refined from  (UO), then converted to  gas (UF). As a gas, it undergoes  to increase the  content from 0.7% to about 4.4% (LEU). It is then turned into a hard  oxide (UO) for assembly as reactor fuel elements.\nThe main by-product of enrichment is  (DU), principally the  isotope, with a U-235 content of ~0.3%. It is stored, either as UF or as UO. Some is used in applications where its extremely high density makes it valuable such as  , and on at least  even a sailboat . It is also used with plutonium for making  (MOX) and to dilute, or , highly enriched uranium from weapons stockpiles which is now being redirected to become reactor fuel.\nThe back-end of the nuclear fuel cycle, mostly spent , contains  that emit beta and gamma radiation, and  that emit , such as  (half-life 245\u00a0thousand years),  (2.144\u00a0million years),  (87.7\u00a0years) and  (432 years), and even sometimes some neutron emitters such as  (half-life of 898 years for Cf-251). These isotopes are formed in .\nIt is important to distinguish the processing of uranium to make fuel from the  of used fuel. Used fuel contains the highly radioactive products of fission (see high level waste below). Many of these are neutron absorbers, called  in this context. These eventually build up to a level where they absorb so many neutrons that the chain reaction stops, even with the control rods completely removed. At that point the fuel has to be replaced in the reactor with fresh fuel, even though there is still a substantial quantity of  and  present. In the United States, this used fuel is usually \"stored\", while in other countries such as Russia, the United Kingdom, France, Japan and India, the fuel is reprocessed to remove the fission products, and the fuel can then be re-used. The fission products removed from the fuel are a concentrated form of high-level waste as are the chemicals used in the process. While these countries reprocess the fuel carrying out single plutonium cycles, India is the only country known to be planning multiple plutonium recycling schemes.\nThe use of different fuels in nuclear reactors results in different  (SNF) composition, with varying activity curves.\nLong-lived radioactive waste from the back end of the fuel cycle is especially relevant when designing a complete waste management plan for SNF. When looking at long-term , the actinides in the SNF have a significant influence due to their characteristically long half-lives. Depending on what a  is fueled with, the actinide composition in the SNF will be different.\nAn example of this effect is the use of  with . Th-232 is a fertile material that can undergo a neutron capture reaction and two beta minus decays, resulting in the production of fissile . The SNF of a cycle with thorium will contain U-233. Its radioactive decay will strongly influence the long-term  curve of the SNF around a million years. A comparison of the activity associated to U-233 for three different SNF types can be seen in the figure on the top right. The burnt fuels are thorium with reactor-grade plutonium (RGPu), thorium with weapons-grade plutonium (WGPu) and  (MOX, no thorium). For RGPu and WGPu, the initial amount of U-233 and its decay around a million years can be seen. This has an effect in the total activity curve of the three fuel types. The initial absence of U-233 and its daughter products in the MOX fuel results in a lower activity in region 3 of the figure on the bottom right, whereas for RGPu and WGPu the curve is maintained higher due to the presence of U-233 that has not fully decayed.  can remove the actinides from the spent fuel so they can be used or destroyed (see ).\nSince uranium and plutonium are  materials, there have been proliferation concerns. Ordinarily (in ), plutonium is . In addition to , which is highly suitable for building nuclear weapons, it contains large amounts of undesirable contaminants: , , and . These isotopes are extremely difficult to separate, and more cost-effective ways of obtaining fissile material exist (e.g., uranium enrichment or dedicated plutonium production reactors).\nHigh-level waste is full of highly radioactive , most of which are relatively short-lived. This is a concern since if the waste is stored, perhaps in , over many years the fission products decay, decreasing the radioactivity of the waste and making the plutonium easier to access. The undesirable contaminant Pu-240 decays faster than the Pu-239, and thus the quality of the bomb material increases with time (although its quantity decreases during that time as well). Thus, some have argued, as time passes, these deep storage areas have the potential to become \"plutonium mines\", from which material for nuclear weapons can be acquired with relatively little difficulty. Critics of the latter idea have pointed out the difficulty of recovering useful material from sealed deep storage areas makes other methods preferable. Specifically, the high radioactivity and heat (80\u00b0C in surrounding rock) greatly increases the difficulty of mining a storage area, and the enrichment methods required have high capital costs.\nPu-239 decays to  which is suitable for weapons and which has a very long half-life (roughly 10 years). Thus plutonium may decay and leave uranium-235. However, modern reactors are only moderately enriched with U-235 relative to U-238, so the U-238 continues to serve as a  agent for any U-235 produced by plutonium decay.\nOne solution to this problem is to recycle the plutonium and use it as a fuel e.g. in . In , the separated plutonium and uranium are contaminated by actinides and cannot be used for nuclear weapons.\nWaste from nuclear weapons decommissioning is unlikely to contain much beta or gamma activity other than  and . It is more likely to contain alpha-emitting actinides such as Pu-239 which is a fissile material used in bombs, plus some material with much higher specific activities, such as Pu-238 or Po.\nIn the past the neutron trigger for an  tended to be  and a high activity alpha emitter such as ; an alternative to polonium is . For reasons of national security, details of the design of modern bombs are normally not released to the open literature.\nSome designs might contain a  using Pu-238 to provide a long lasting source of electrical power for the electronics in the device.\nIt is likely that the fissile material of an old bomb which is due for refitting will contain decay products of the plutonium isotopes used in it, these are likely to include  from Pu-240 impurities, plus some U-235 from decay of the Pu-239; due to the relatively long half-life of these Pu isotopes, these wastes from radioactive decay of bomb core material would be very small, and in any case, far less dangerous (even in terms of simple radioactivity) than the Pu-239 itself.\nThe beta decay of  forms ; the in-growth of americium is likely to be a greater problem than the decay of Pu-239 and Pu-240 as the americium is a gamma emitter (increasing external-exposure to workers) and is an alpha emitter which can cause the generation of . The plutonium could be separated from the americium by several different processes; these would include  processes and aqueous/organic . A truncated  type extraction process would be one possible method of making the separation.\nNaturally occurring uranium is not fissile because it contains 99.3% of U-238 and only 0.7% of U-235.\nDue to historic activities typically related to radium industry, uranium mining, and military programs, numerous sites contain or are contaminated with radioactivity. In the United States alone, the  states there are \"millions of gallons of radioactive waste\" as well as \"thousands of tons of  and material\" and also \"huge quantities of contaminated soil and water.\" Despite copious quantities of waste, the DOE has stated a goal of cleaning all presently contaminated sites successfully by 2025. The ,  site for example had \"31 million pounds of uranium product\", \"2.5 billion pounds of waste\", \"2.75 million cubic yards of contaminated soil and debris\", and a \"223 acre portion of the underlying Great Miami Aquifer had uranium levels above drinking standards.\" The United States has at least 108 sites designated as areas that are contaminated and unusable, sometimes many thousands of acres. DOE wishes to clean or mitigate many or all by 2025, using the recently developed method of , however the task can be difficult and it acknowledges that some may never be completely remediated. In just one of these 108 larger designations, , there were for example at least \"167 known contaminant release sites\" in one of the three subdivisions of the 37,000-acre (150\u00a0km) site. Some of the U.S. sites were smaller in nature, however, cleanup issues were simpler to address, and DOE has successfully completed cleanup, or at least closure, of several sites.\nRadioactive  tends to contain  and  emitters. It can be divided into two main classes. In diagnostic  a number of short-lived gamma emitters such as  are used. Many of these can be disposed of by leaving it to decay for a short time before disposal as normal waste. Other isotopes used in medicine, with half-lives in parentheses, include:\n source waste can contain , ,  or gamma emitters. Gamma emitters are used in  while neutron emitting sources are used in a range of applications, such as  logging.\nSubstances containing natural radioactivity are known as  (Naturally occurring radioactive material). After human processing that exposes or concentrates this natural radioactivity (such as mining bringing coal to the surface or burning it to produce concentrated ash), it becomes technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive material (TENORM). A lot of this waste is -emitting matter from the decay chains of  and . The main source of radiation in the human body is -40 (), typically 17 milligrams in the body at a time and 0.4 milligrams/day intake. Most rocks, especially , have a low level of radioactivity due to the potassium-40, thorium and uranium contained.\nUsually ranging from 1  (mSv) to 13\u00a0mSv annually depending on location, average radiation exposure from natural radioisotopes is 2.0\u00a0mSv per person a year worldwide. This makes up the majority of typical total dosage (with mean annual exposure from other sources amounting to 0.6\u00a0mSv from medical tests averaged over the whole populace, 0.4\u00a0mSv from , 0.005\u00a0mSv from the legacy of past atmospheric nuclear testing, 0.005\u00a0mSv occupational exposure, 0.002\u00a0mSv from the , and 0.0002\u00a0mSv from the nuclear fuel cycle).\nTENORM is not regulated as restrictively as nuclear reactor waste, though there are no significant differences in the radiological risks of these materials.\n contains a small amount of radioactive uranium, barium, thorium and potassium, but, in the case of pure coal, this is significantly less than the average concentration of those elements in the . The surrounding strata, if shale or mudstone, often contain slightly more than average and this may also be reflected in the ash content of 'dirty' coals. The more active ash minerals become concentrated in the  precisely because they do not burn well. The radioactivity of fly ash is about the same as black  and is less than  rocks, but is more of a concern because a small amount of the fly ash ends up in the atmosphere where it can be inhaled. According to U.S.  reports, population exposure from 1000-MWe power plants amounts to 490  for coal power plants, 100 times as great as nuclear power plants (4.8 person-rem/year). (The exposure from the complete nuclear fuel cycle from mining to waste disposal is 136 person-rem/year; the corresponding value for coal use from mining to waste disposal is \"probably unknown\".)\nResidues from the  often contain radium and its decay products. The sulfate scale from an oil well can be very radium rich, while the water, oil and gas from a well often contain . The radon decays to form solid radioisotopes which form coatings on the inside of pipework. In an oil processing plant the area of the plant where  is processed is often one of the more contaminated areas of the plant as radon has a similar boiling point to propane.\nRadioactive elements are an industrial problem in some oil wells where workers operating in direct contact with the crude oil and  can be actually exposed to doses having negative health effects. Due to relatively high concentration of these elements in the brine, its disposal is also technological challenge. In the USA the brine is however exempt from the dangerous waste regulations and can be disposed of regardless of radioactive or toxic substances content sine 80's.\nDue to natural occurrence of radioactive elements such as  and  in , mining operations also result in production of waste and mineral deposits that are slightly radioactive. \nClassifications of radioactive waste varies by country. The IAEA, which publishes the Radioactive Waste Safety Standards (RADWASS), also plays a significant role. The proportion of various types of waste generated in the UK:\n\nUranium tailings are waste by-product materials left over from the rough processing of -bearing . They are not significantly radioactive. Mill tailings are sometimes referred to as , from the section of the  that defines them. Uranium mill tailings typically also contain   such as  and . Vast mounds of uranium mill tailings are left at many old mining sites, especially in , , and .\nAlthough mill tailings are not very radioactive, they have long half-lives. Mill tailings often contain radium, thorium and trace amounts of uranium.\nLow level waste (LLW) is generated from hospitals and industry, as well as the . Low-level wastes include , rags, , , filters, and other materials which contain small amounts of mostly short-lived radioactivity. Materials that originate from any region of an Active Area are commonly designated as LLW as a precautionary measure even if there is only a remote possibility of being contaminated with radioactive materials. Such LLW typically exhibits no higher radioactivity than one would expect from the same material disposed of in a non-active area, such as a normal office block. Example LLW includes wiping rags, mops, medical tubes, laboratory animal carcasses, and more. LLW waste makes 94% of all radioactive waste volume in the UK.\nSome high-activity LLW requires shielding during handling and transport but most LLW is suitable for shallow land burial. To reduce its volume, it is often compacted or incinerated before disposal. Low-level waste is divided into four classes: , , , and  ().\nIntermediate-level waste (ILW) contains higher amounts of radioactivity compared to low-level waste. \nIt generally requires shielding, but not cooling. \nIntermediate-level wastes includes ,  and metal  cladding, as well as contaminated materials from . It may be solidified in  or  or mixed with silica sand and  for disposal. As a general rule, short-lived waste (mainly non-fuel materials from reactors) is buried in shallow repositories, while long-lived waste (from fuel and ) is deposited in . U.S. regulations do not define this category of waste; the term is used in Europe and elsewhere. ILW makes ca 6% of all radioactive waste volume in the UK.\nHigh-level waste (HLW) is produced by nuclear reactors. The exact definition of HLW differs internationally. After a nuclear fuel rod serves one fuel cycle and is removed from the core, it is considered HLW. Fuel rods contain  and  generated in the . Spent fuel is highly radioactive and often hot. HLW accounts for over 95% of the total radioactivity produced in the process of nuclear  but it contributes to less than 1% of volume of all radioactive waste produced in the UK. Overall, 60-years long nuclear program in the UK  up until 2019 produced 2150 m of HLW. \nThe radioactive waste from spent fuel rods consist primarily of cesium-137 and strontium-90, but it may also include plutonium, which can be considered a transuranic waste. The half-lives of these radioactive elements can differ quite extremely. Some elements, such as cesium-137 and strontium-90 have half-lives of approximately 30 years. Meanwhile, plutonium has a half-life of that can stretch to as long as 24,000 years.\nThe amount of HLW worldwide is currently increasing by about 12,000  every year. \nA 1000- nuclear power plant produces about 27 tonnes of spent nuclear fuel (unreprocessed) every year. For comparison, the amount of ash produced by coal power plants in the US alone is estimated at 130'000'000 metric tons per year and fly ash is estimated to release 100x more radiation than an equivalent nuclear power plant. \nIn 2010, it was estimated that about 250,000 tons of nuclear HLW were stored globally. \nThis does not include amounts that have escaped into the environment from accidents or tests. \n is estimated to hold 17,000 tons of HLW in storage in 2015. \nAs of 2019, the  has over 90,000 tons of HLW. \nHLW have been shipped to other countries to be stored or reprocessed, and in some cases, shipped back as active fuel.\nThe ongoing controversy over  is a major constraint on the nuclear power's global expansion. \nMost scientists agree that the main proposed long-term solution is deep geological burial, either in a mine or a deep borehole.\nAs of 2019 no dedicated civilian high-level nuclear waste is operational as small amounts of HLW did not justify the investment before. Finland is in the advanced stage of the construction the  planned to open in 2025 at 400-450 m depth.  France is in the planning phase for 500 m deep Cigeo facility in Bure. Sweden plans a site in . Canada plans 680 m deep facility near Lake Huron in Ontario. Republic of Korea plans to open a site around 2028. The site in Sweden enjoys 80% support from local residents as of 2020.\nThe  is currently the only  high-level radioactive waste storage site in the United States.\nTransuranic waste (TRUW) as defined by U.S. regulations is, without regard to form or origin, waste that is contaminated with -emitting transuranic  with  greater than 20 years and concentrations greater than 100\u00a0/g (3.7\u00a0/kg), excluding high-level waste. Elements that have an atomic number greater than uranium are called transuranic (\"beyond uranium\"). Because of their long half-lives, TRUW is disposed more cautiously than either low- or intermediate-level waste. In the U.S., it arises mainly from  production, and consists of clothing, tools, rags, residues, debris and other items contaminated with small amounts of radioactive elements (mainly ).\nUnder U.S. law, transuranic waste is further categorized into \"contact-handled\" (CH) and \"remote-handled\" (RH) on the basis of the radiation dose rate measured at the surface of the waste container. CH TRUW has a surface dose rate not greater than 200  per hour (2\u00a0mSv/h), whereas RH TRUW has a surface dose rate of 200\u00a0mrem/h (2\u00a0mSv/h) or greater. CH TRUW does not have the very high radioactivity of high-level waste, nor its high heat generation, but RH TRUW can be highly radioactive, with surface dose rates up to 1,000,000 \u00a0mrem/h (10,000\u00a0mSv/h). The U.S. currently disposes of TRUW generated from military facilities at the  (WIPP) in a deep salt formation in .\nA future way to reduce waste accumulation is to phase out current reactors in favor of , which output less waste per power generated.  such as  in Russia are also able to consume  fuel that is manufactured from recycled spent fuel from traditional reactors.\nThe UK's  published a position paper in 2014 on the progress on approaches to the management of separated plutonium, which summarises the conclusions of the work that NDA shared with UK government.\n\nOf particular concern in nuclear waste management are two long-lived fission products, Tc-99 (half-life 220,000 years) and I-129 (half-life 15.7 million years), which dominate spent fuel radioactivity after a few thousand years. The most troublesome transuranic elements in spent fuel are Np-237 (half-life two million years) and Pu-239 (half-life 24,000 years). Nuclear waste requires sophisticated treatment and management to successfully isolate it from interacting with the . This usually necessitates treatment, followed by a long-term management strategy involving storage, disposal or transformation of the waste into a non-toxic form. Governments around the world are considering a range of waste management and disposal options, though there has been limited progress toward long-term waste management solutions.\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, several methods of disposal of radioactive waste were investigated by nuclear nations, which are\u00a0:\nIn the US, waste management policy completely broke down with the ending of work on the incomplete . At present there are 70 nuclear power plant sites where  is stored. A Blue Ribbon Commission was appointed by President Obama to look into future options for this and future waste. A  seems to be favored.  2018 -winner , has proposed using  to generate high-energy and low-duration laser pulses to transmute highly radioactive material (contained in a target) to significantly reduce its half-life, from thousands of years to only a few minutes.\nLong-term storage of radioactive waste requires the stabilization of the waste into a form which will neither react nor degrade for extended periods. It is theorized that one way to do this might be through . Currently at  the high-level waste ( first cycle ) is mixed with  and then calcined.  involves passing the waste through a heated, rotating tube. The purposes of calcination are to evaporate the water from the waste, and de-nitrate the fission products to assist the stability of the glass produced.\nThe 'calcine' generated is fed continuously into an induction heated furnace with fragmented . The resulting glass is a new substance in which the waste products are bonded into the glass matrix when it solidifies. As a melt, this product is poured into  cylindrical containers (\"cylinders\") in a batch process. When cooled, the fluid solidifies (\"vitrifies\") into the glass. After being formed, the glass is highly resistant to water.\nAfter filling a cylinder, a seal is  onto the cylinder head. The cylinder is then washed. After being inspected for external contamination, the steel cylinder is stored, usually in an underground repository. In this form, the waste products are expected to be immobilized for thousands of years.\nThe glass inside a cylinder is usually a black glossy substance. All this work (in the United Kingdom) is done using  systems. Sugar is added to control the  chemistry and to stop the formation of the volatile  containing . In the West, the glass is normally a  (similar to ), while in the former  it is normal to use a . The amount of fission products in the glass must be limited because some (, the other Pt group metals, and ) tend to form metallic phases which separate from the glass. Bulk vitrification uses electrodes to melt soil and wastes, which are then buried underground. In Germany a vitrification plant is in use; this is treating the waste from a small demonstration reprocessing plant which has since been closed down.\nVitrification is not the only way to stabilize the waste into a form that will not react or degrade for extended periods. Immobilization via direct incorporation into a phosphate based crystalline ceramic host is also used. The diverse chemistry of phosphate ceramics under various conditions demonstrate a versatile material that can withstand chemical, thermal and radioactive degradation over time. The properties of phosphates, particularly ceramic phosphates, of stability over a wide pH range, low porosity and minimization of secondary waste introduces possibilities for new waste immobilization techniques.\nIt is common for medium active wastes in the nuclear industry to be treated with  or other means to concentrate the radioactivity into a small volume. The much less radioactive bulk (after treatment) is often then discharged. For instance, it is possible to use a    to remove radioactive metals from aqueous mixtures. After the radioisotopes are absorbed onto the ferric hydroxide, the resulting sludge can be placed in a metal drum before being mixed with cement to form a solid waste form. In order to get better long-term performance (mechanical stability) from such forms, they may be made from a mixture of , or  , and , instead of normal  (made with Portland cement, gravel and sand).\nThe Australian  (synthetic rock) is a more sophisticated way to immobilize such waste, and this process may eventually come into commercial use for civil wastes (it is currently being developed for US military wastes). Synroc was invented by Prof Ted Ringwood (a ) at the . The Synroc contains  and cryptomelane type minerals. The original form of Synroc (Synroc C) was designed for the liquid high level waste (PUREX raffinate) from a . The main minerals in this Synroc are hollandite (BaAlTiO),  (CaZrTiO) and  (CaTiO). The zirconolite and perovskite are hosts for the . The  and  will be fixed in the perovskite. The  will be fixed in the hollandite.\nThe time frame in question when dealing with radioactive waste ranges from 10,000 to 1,000,000 years, according to studies based on the effect of estimated radiation doses.\nResearchers suggest that forecasts of health detriment for such periods should be examined critically.\n Practical studies only consider up to 100 years as far as effective planning and cost evaluations are concerned. Long term behavior of radioactive wastes remains a subject for ongoing research projects in .\n typically involves taking waste from a  and sealing it (along with an ) in a  cylinder, which is placed in a  cylinder which acts as a radiation shield. It is a relatively inexpensive method which can be done at a central facility or adjacent to the source reactor. The waste can be easily retrieved for reprocessing.\nThe process of selecting appropriate  for high level waste and spent fuel is now under way in several countries with the first expected to be commissioned some time after 2010. The basic concept is to locate a large, stable geologic formation and use mining technology to excavate a tunnel, or large-bore  (similar to those used to drill the  from England to France) to drill a shaft 500 metres (1,600\u00a0ft) to 1,000 metres (3,300\u00a0ft) below the surface where rooms or vaults can be excavated for disposal of high-level radioactive waste. The goal is to permanently isolate nuclear waste from the human environment. Many people remain uncomfortable with the immediate  of this disposal system, suggesting perpetual management and monitoring would be more prudent.\nBecause some radioactive species have half-lives longer than one million years, even very low container leakage and radionuclide migration rates must be taken into account. Moreover, it may require more than one half-life until some nuclear materials lose enough radioactivity to cease being lethal to living things. A 1983 review of the Swedish radioactive waste disposal program by the National Academy of Sciences found that country's estimate of several hundred thousand years\u2014perhaps up to one million years\u2014being necessary for waste isolation \"fully justified.\"\n of radioactive waste has been suggested by the finding that deep waters in the North Atlantic Ocean do not present an exchange with shallow waters for about 140 years based on oxygen content data recorded over a period of 25 years. They include burial beneath a stable , burial in a  zone that would slowly carry the waste downward into the , and burial beneath a remote natural or human-made island. While these approaches all have merit and would facilitate an international solution to the problem of disposal of radioactive waste, they would require an amendment of the .\nArticle 1 (Definitions), 7., of the 1996 Protocol to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, (the London Dumping Convention) states:\nThe proposed land-based subductive waste disposal method disposes of nuclear waste in a  zone accessed from land and therefore is not prohibited by international agreement. This method has been described as the most viable means of disposing of radioactive waste, and as the state-of-the-art as of 2001 in nuclear waste disposal technology.\nAnother approach termed Remix & Return would blend high-level waste with  and mill tailings down to the level of the original radioactivity of the , then replace it in inactive uranium mines. This approach has the merits of providing jobs for miners who would double as disposal staff, and of facilitating a cradle-to-grave cycle for radioactive materials, but would be inappropriate for spent reactor fuel in the absence of reprocessing, due to the presence of highly toxic radioactive elements such as plutonium within it.\n is the concept of disposing of high-level radioactive waste from nuclear reactors in extremely deep boreholes. Deep borehole disposal seeks to place the waste as much as 5 kilometres (3.1\u00a0mi) beneath the surface of the Earth and relies primarily on the immense natural geological barrier to confine the waste safely and permanently so that it should never pose a threat to the environment. The Earth's crust contains 120 trillion tons of thorium and 40 trillion tons of uranium (primarily at relatively trace concentrations of parts per million each adding up over the crust's 3 * 10 ton mass), among other natural radioisotopes. Since the fraction of nuclides decaying per unit of time is inversely proportional to an isotope's half-life, the relative radioactivity of the lesser amount of human-produced radioisotopes (thousands of tons instead of trillions of tons) would diminish once the isotopes with far shorter half-lives than the bulk of natural radioisotopes decayed.\nIn January 2013,   rejected UK central government proposals to start work on an underground storage dump for nuclear waste near to the . \"For any host community, there will be a substantial community benefits package and worth hundreds of millions of pounds\" said Ed Davey, Energy Secretary, but nonetheless, the local elected body voted 7\u20133 against research continuing, after hearing evidence from independent geologists that \"the fractured strata of the county was impossible to entrust with such dangerous material and a hazard lasting millennia.\"\n describes proposals to drill over one kilometer vertically, and two kilometers horizontally in the earth\u2019s crust, for the purpose of disposing of high-level waste forms such as , , or . After the emplacement and the retrievability period, drillholes would be backfilled and sealed. A series of tests of the technology were carried out in November 2018 and then again publicly in January 2019 by a U.S. based private company. The test demonstrated the emplacement of a test-canister in a horizontal drillhole and retrieval of the same canister. There was no actual high-level waste used in this test.\nThere have been proposals for reactors that consume nuclear waste and transmute it to other, less-harmful or shorter-lived, nuclear waste. In particular, the  was a proposed nuclear reactor with a nuclear fuel cycle that produced no transuranic waste and in fact, could consume transuranic waste. It proceeded as far as large-scale tests, but was then canceled by the US Government. Another approach, considered safer but requiring more development, is to dedicate  to the  of the left-over transuranic elements.\nAn isotope that is found in nuclear waste and that represents a concern in terms of proliferation is Pu-239. The large stock of plutonium is a result of its production inside uranium-fueled reactors and of the reprocessing of weapons-grade plutonium during the weapons program. An option for getting rid of this plutonium is to use it as a fuel in a traditional Light Water Reactor (LWR). Several fuel types with differing plutonium destruction efficiencies are under study.\nTransmutation was banned in the US in April 1977 by President Carter due to the danger of plutonium proliferation, but President Reagan rescinded the ban in 1981. Due to the economic losses and risks, construction of reprocessing plants during this time did not resume. Due to high energy demand, work on the method has continued in the . This has resulted in a practical nuclear research reactor called  in which transmutation is possible. Additionally, a new research program called ACTINET has been started in the  to make transmutation possible on a large, industrial scale. According to President Bush's Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) of 2007, the US is now actively promoting research on transmutation technologies needed to markedly reduce the problem of nuclear waste treatment.\nThere have also been theoretical studies involving the use of  as so called \"actinide burners\" where a fusion reactor  such as in a , could be \"doped\" with a small amount of the \"minor\" transuranic atoms which would be transmuted (meaning fissioned in the actinide case) to lighter elements upon their successive bombardment by the very high energy neutrons produced by the fusion of  and  in the reactor. A study at  found that only 2 or 3 fusion reactors with parameters similar to that of the  (ITER) could transmute the entire annual  production from all of the  presently operating in the United States fleet while simultaneously generating approximately 1  of power from each reactor.\nAnother option is to find applications for the isotopes in nuclear waste so as to  them.\nAlready, ,  and a few other isotopes are extracted for certain industrial applications such as  and . While re-use does not eliminate the need to manage radioisotopes, it can reduce the quantity of waste produced.\nThe Nuclear Assisted Hydrocarbon Production Method, Canadian patent application 2,659,302, is a method for the temporary or permanent storage of nuclear waste materials comprising the placing of waste materials into one or more repositories or boreholes constructed into an  formation. The thermal flux of the waste materials fracture the formation and alters the chemical and/or physical properties of hydrocarbon material within the subterranean formation to allow removal of the altered material. A mixture of hydrocarbons, hydrogen, and/or other formation fluids is produced from the formation. The radioactivity of high-level radioactive waste affords proliferation resistance to plutonium placed in the periphery of the repository or the deepest portion of a borehole.\n can run on U-238 and transuranic elements, which comprise the majority of spent fuel radioactivity in the 1,000\u2013100,000-year time span.\nSpace disposal is attractive because it removes nuclear waste from the planet. It has significant disadvantages, such as the potential for catastrophic failure of a , which could spread radioactive material into the atmosphere and around the world. A high number of launches would be required because no individual rocket would be able to carry very much of the material relative to the total amount that needs to be disposed of. This makes the proposal impractical economically and it increases the risk of at least one or more launch failures.\nTo further complicate matters, international agreements on the regulation of such a program would need to be established.\nCosts and inadequate reliability of modern rocket launch systems for space disposal has been one of the motives for interest in  systems such as , , and other proposals.\nSweden and Finland are furthest along in committing to a particular disposal technology, while many others reprocess spent fuel or contract with France or Great Britain to do it, taking back the resulting plutonium and high-level waste. \"An increasing backlog of plutonium from reprocessing is developing in many countries... It is doubtful that reprocessing makes economic sense in the present environment of cheap uranium.\"\nIn many European countries (e.g., Britain, Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland) the risk or dose limit for a member of the public exposed to radiation from a future high-level nuclear waste facility is considerably more stringent than that suggested by the International Commission on Radiation Protection or proposed in the United States. European limits are often more stringent than the standard suggested in 1990 by the International Commission on Radiation Protection by a factor of 20, and more stringent by a factor of ten than the standard proposed by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for  for the first 10,000 years after closure.\nThe U.S. EPA's proposed standard for greater than 10,000 years is 250 times more permissive than the European limit. The U.S. EPA proposed a legal limit of a maximum of 3.5  (350 ) each annually to local individuals after 10,000 years, which would be up to several percent of the exposure currently received by some populations in the highest natural background regions on Earth, though the U.S.  predicted that . Over a timeframe of thousands of years, after the most active short half-life radioisotopes decayed, burying U.S. nuclear waste would increase the radioactivity in the top 2000 feet of rock and soil in the  (10 million km) by approximately 1 part in 10 million over the cumulative amount of  in such a volume, but the vicinity of the site would have a far higher concentration of artificial radioisotopes underground than such an average.\nAfter serious opposition had arisen about plans and negotiations between  with Japan and the United States of America to build nuclear-waste facilities in Mongolia, Mongolia stopped all negotiations in September 2011. These negotiations had started after U.S. Deputy Secretary of Energy  visited Mongolia in September, 2010. Talks took place in Washington, D.C. between officials of Japan, the United States and Mongolia in February 2011. After this the  (UAE), which wanted to buy nuclear fuel from Mongolia, joined in the negotiations. The talks were kept secret, and although The  reported on them in May, Mongolia officially denied the existence of these negotiations. However, alarmed by this news, Mongolian citizens protested against the plans, and demanded the government withdraw the plans and disclose information. The Mongolian President  issued a presidential order on September 13 banning all negotiations with foreign governments or international organizations on nuclear-waste storage plans in Mongolia. The Mongolian government has accused the newspaper of distributing false claims around the world. After the presidential order, the Mongolian president fired the individual who was supposedly involved in these conversations.\nAuthorities in Italy are investigating a  mafia clan accused of trafficking and illegally dumping nuclear waste. According to a , a manager of the Italy's state energy research agency  paid the clan to get rid of 600 drums of toxic and radioactive waste from Italy, Switzerland, France, Germany, and the US, with  as the destination, where the waste was buried after buying off local politicians. Former employees of Enea are suspected of paying the criminals to take waste off their hands in the 1980s and 1990s. Shipments to Somalia continued into the 1990s, while the 'Ndrangheta clan also blew up shiploads of waste, including radioactive hospital waste, sending them to the sea bed off the  coast. According to the environmental group , former members of the 'Ndrangheta have said that they were paid to sink ships with radioactive material for the last 20 years.\nA few incidents have occurred when radioactive material was disposed of improperly, shielding during transport was defective, or when it was simply abandoned or even stolen from a waste store. In the Soviet Union, waste stored in  was blown over the area during a  after the lake had partly dried out. At , a low-level radioactive waste facility located in , containment trenches covered with dirt, instead of steel or cement, collapsed under heavy rainfall into the trenches and filled with water. The water that invaded the trenches became radioactive and had to be disposed of at the Maxey Flat facility itself. In other cases of radioactive waste accidents, lakes or ponds with radioactive waste accidentally overflowed into the rivers during exceptional storms. In Italy, several radioactive waste deposits let material flow into river water, thus contaminating water for domestic use. In France, in the summer of 2008 numerous incidents happened; in one, at the Areva plant in , it was reported that during a draining operation, liquid containing untreated uranium overflowed out of a faulty tank and about 75\u00a0kg of the radioactive material seeped into the ground and, from there, into two rivers nearby; in another case, over 100 staff were contaminated with low doses of radiation. There are ongoing concerns around deterioration of the nuclear waste site on the  of the  and a potential radioactive spill.\nScavenging of abandoned radioactive material has been the cause of several other cases of , mostly in , which may have less regulation of dangerous substances (and sometimes less general education about radioactivity and its hazards) and a market for scavenged goods and scrap metal. The scavengers and those who buy the material are almost always unaware that the material is radioactive and it is selected for its  or scrap value. Irresponsibility on the part of the radioactive material's owners, usually a hospital, university or military, and the absence of regulation concerning radioactive waste, or a lack of enforcement of such regulations, have been significant factors in radiation exposures. For an example of an accident involving radioactive scrap originating from a hospital see the .\nTransportation accidents involving spent nuclear fuel from power plants are unlikely to have serious consequences due to the strength of the .\nOn 15 December 2011, top government spokesman Osamu Fujimura of the Japanese government admitted that nuclear substances were found in the waste of Japanese nuclear facilities.

Japan did start discussions with the IAEA about the large quantities of enriched uranium and plutonium that were discovered in nuclear waste cleared away by Japanese nuclear operators. At the press conference Fujimura said: \"Based on investigations so far, most nuclear substances have been properly managed as waste, and from that perspective, there is no problem in safety management,\" But according to him, the matter was at that moment still being investigated.\nThe trefoil symbol used to indicate ionizing radiation.\n2007 ISO radioactivity danger symbol intended for IAEA Category 1, 2 and 3 sources defined as dangerous sources capable of death or serious injury.\nThe dangerous goods transport classification sign for radioactive materials\n"},

Reuse sits high on the .  When a container is used multiple times, the material required per use or per filling cycle is reduced.\nMany potential factors are involved in environmental comparisons of returnable vs. non-returnable systems.  Researchers have often used  methodologies to balance the many diverse considerations.  Some comparisons show no clear winner but rather show a realistic view of a complex subject.\nArguments in favor of reusing bottles, or recycling them into other products, are compelling. It is estimated that in the U.S. alone, consumers use 1,500 plastic water bottles every single second. But only about 23% of , which is the plastic used in disposable plastic water bottles, gets recycled. Thus, about 38 billion water bottles are thrown away annually, equating to roughly $1 billion worth of plastic. The average American spends $242 per year per person on disposable, single use plastic water bottles. The environmental and cost consequences associated with disposable plastic water bottles are a strong argument for reusing bottles.\nReusable drinking bottles for water, coffee, salad dressing, soup, baby formula, and other beverages have gained in popularity by consumers in recent years, due to the costs and environmental problems associated with single use plastic bottles. Common materials used to make reusable drinking bottles include glass, aluminum, stainless steel, and plastic. Reusable bottles include both single and double wall insulated bottles.

It involves looking at all stages of a product's life to find where improvements can be made to reduce environmental impacts and improve the use or  of resources.  A key goal is to avoid actions that shift negative impacts from one stage to another.  Life cycle thinking can be applied to the five stages of the waste management hierarchy.\nFor example, life-cycle analysis has shown that it is often better for the environment to replace an old washing machine, despite the waste generated, than to continue to use an older machine which is less . This is because a washing machine's greatest environmental impact is during its use phase. Buying an energy-efficient machine and using low- temperature detergent reduce environmental impacts.\nThe European Union Waste Framework Directive has introduced the concept of life-cycle thinking into waste policies.  This duality approach gives a broader view of all environmental aspects and ensures any action has an overall benefit compared to other options.  The actions to deal with waste along the hierarchy should be compatible with other environmental initiatives.\nThe  refers to the 5 steps included in the article 4 of the :\nAccording to the  the European Waste Hierarchy is legally binding except in cases that may require specific waste streams to depart from the hierarchy.

The waste framework directive of 1975 had no reference to a waste hierarchy. \nIn 1975, The European Union's  (1975/442/EEC) introduced for the first time the elements of the waste hierarchy concept into European waste policy. It emphasized the importance of , and the  and , as a priority. Following the 1975 Directive, European Union policy and legislation adapted to the principles of the waste hierarchy.\nA fundament to the waste hierarchy concept is known as 'Lansink's Ladder', named after the Member of the Dutch Parliament who proposed it in 1979 to be incorporated into Dutch policy in 1993.\nIn 1989, it was formalized into a hierarchy of management options in the European Commission's Community Strategy for Waste Management and this waste strategy was further endorsed in the Commission's review in 1996.\nIn the first legislative proposals of 2006 the  suggested a 3-step hierarchy composed of 1- Prevention and Reuse, 2- Recycling and Recovery (with ) and 3- Disposal. This was heavily criticised because it was putting recycling at the same level of incineration which was coherent with the traditional pro-incineration position from the European Commission. The pressure from NGOs and member states managed to turn the initial non-binding 3 step hierarchy into a quasi-binding 5 step hierarchy.\nIn 2008, the European Union introduced a new  to its waste legislation, Directive 2008/98/EC, which member states must introduce into national waste management laws. Article 4 of the directive lays down a five-step hierarchy of waste management options which must be applied by Member States in this priority order.  Waste prevention, as the preferred option, is followed by reuse, recycling, recovery including  and as a last option, safe disposal. Among engineers, a similar hierarchy of waste management has been known as ARRE strategy: avoid, reduce, recycle, eliminate.\nThe task of implementing the waste hierarchy in waste management practices within a country may be delegated to the different levels of government (national, regional, local) and to other possible factors including industry, private companies and households. Local and regional authorities can be particularly challenged by the following issues when applying the waste hierarchy approach. \n involves efforts to reduce  and other materials by modifying industrial production.

Passed by the  in 2009, it became the first local municipal ordinance in the  to universally require source separation of all organic material, including food residuals.\nThe roots of San Francisco's recycling and composting program can be traced back to the formation of the Scavengers Protective Union in 1879,  when loose federations of  began.  Most were Italian immigrants from one region of Italy and they hauled municipal waste in horse-drawn wagons and hand separated valuable discards for resale.  The scavengers made a living from materials similar to those salvaged in recycling programs today such as wood, metals, glass, rags, yard trimmings and food residuals. At that time, some of the materials were used as fuel, others were recycled and the yard debris and food residuals were sold to hog farmers in the outlying neighborhoods of the City for use as animal feed.\nIn 1921, the City began regulating waste collection and around the same time, scavengers, who were fiercely competing for the same materials, began forming associations. Rates were set under the 1932 ordinance, and required voter approval to change.  This was modified by an amendment to the 1932 ordinance, approved by the voters in 1954 and effective in 1955, which established a rate adjustment system managed by City staff.\nCooperation amongst the former rivals allowed them to pool their resources.  The two loose associations became known as Scavenger's Protective Association and Sunset Scavenger Company. These two entities eventually merged, and as a result all of the permits issued by the City came to be held by one entity. The exclusive refuse collection licenses for the City in 1932\u2014licenses still held today under the parent company, . This steadfast relationship between the City and Recology San Francisco has resulted in a reliable public-private partnership, allowing San Francisco to design experimental pilot programs such as city-wide curbside organics collection.\nAlthough San Francisco has the highest diversion rate amongst all large cities in the United States today, in the late 1950s, the advent of packer trucks forced the City's recycling rate to an all-time low. Because separation of compacted materials was unfeasible, by 1967  company and  had scaled back their recycling operations to a mere two programs, metals and . However, the 1970s brought a renewed interest in resource conservation. The Federal Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act were signed into legislation and  the first  celebration was held on April 22, 1970. In the spirit of these times, San Francisco residents proactively organized to create new volunteer-run community recycling centers. By 1980, San Francisco had a total of ten community recycling centers, offering residents the opportunity to recycle their newspaper, glass and cans.\nIn 1980, under the City's Chief Administrative Officer, the San Francisco Recycling Program (SFRP) was developed as a division of the Solid Waste Management Program. The goal of the SFRP was to facilitate and develop recycling programs throughout the city. After receiving a grant from the state in 1981, the City established three buy-back centers and launched its first curbside recycling program. With the passage of California's Bottle Bill (AB2020) in 1986, all community recycling centers in San Francisco began offering monetary compensation for materials with a .\nWhile this initial curbside recycling collection was unsuccessful due to scavengers, San Francisco continued to promote recycling efforts. The City formed an advisory council to help design another residential curbside pilot and collaboratively started two new programs targeting bar and restaurant glass collection and city government office paper recycling.  In 1988, San Francisco's Solid Waste Management Program set diversion goals, calling for a 32 percent reduction in the City's waste stream by 1992 and 43 percent by 2002. However, in 1989, the California legislature preempted San Francisco's  goals by passing the Integrated Waste Management Act (AB 939), which set waste reduction goals of 25 percent by 1995 and 50 percent by 2000. The City's diversion goals were amended shortly after to reflect the new state requirements.\nBy 1989, the City had begun a series of new curbside pilot programs, collecting mixed paper and containers (glass, aluminum and plastic).  This program was fully operational by 1991, and contributed to San Francisco's achievement of 27 percent diversion in 1990. By 1997, the program had led to an additional 15,500 tons of recyclables diverted, yet, a 1996 waste characterization study illustrated additional opportunities for reaching AB939 goals. According to the study, 60,000 tons of unrecovered recyclables remained in the waste stream, 26 percent of which were food residuals. Because San Francisco is a dense city, yard waste was found to make up only 5 percent of the residential waste stream. These findings, in conjunction with AB939 diversion requirements, prompted San Francisco to develop new curbside recycling pilots that included the collection of food residuals.\nPilot programs are commonly used as a mechanism for determining prospective infrastructure investments and educational tactics including, \"collection containers, vehicles, outreach needs, processing needs and the impact of neighborhoods with different demographics.\"  In 1999, San Francisco and  rolled out their most recent pilot, a dedicated color-coded cart system called the Fantastic Three.  The color-coded cart system was designed to make recycling and composting easy for residents, with each color signifying the type of materials accepted (blue=recycling, green=organics, black=landfill). The Fantastic Three also integrated financial incentives for participation. The program's  framework allowed residents and businesses to reap savings as their trash volumes decreased.  Within seven months, the Fantastic Three, helped to increase diversion by more than 90 percent amongst participating businesses and residents and generated a 73 percent satisfaction rating.  With this success rate, Recology in collaboration with the City, invested in a plan to further expand the program.\nHaving invested in the infrastructure to increase the diversion of organics and recyclables from landfills, San Francisco realized a 50 percent diversion rate shortly after the Fantastic Three program was officially introduced. However, the city decided to pursue higher diversion rates than those required by the state for several reasons. First, the 1997 Sustainability Plan adopted by the Board of Supervisors, included a long-term goal \"to maximize sustainable uses of natural resources and to eliminate solid waste generation in the City and County of San Francisco.\" Additionally, Alameda County adopted Measure D which, \"set a goal of achieving a 75 percent waste diversion rate by 2010 and as a condition of the Waste Disposal Agreement for disposing San Francisco waste in the Altamont Landfill in Alameda County, the City was required to recycle or divert waste at the same or greater level than that of East Bay (Alameda County) jurisdictions using the Altamont landfill.\" As a result, the Board of Supervisors passed the Zero Waste Goal (Resolution No. 007-02-COE) in 2002, requiring San Francisco to divert 75 percent of its waste by 2010 and to achieve zero waste by 2020.\nWhile the City's investment in the Fantastic Three program demonstrated its ability to achieve high diversion rates and encouraged the creation of new goals, the Zero Waste resolution built the framework from which new waste reduction legislation could be drafted. Shortly after the Zero Waste Goal passed, the City began to adopt a series of waste reduction policies as a means to meet its goal of zero waste. A timeline of select waste-reduction legislation is listed below:\nThere were a number of other San Francisco waste reduction policies passed during this time and most of them focus on city government operations. For example, the Mayor's Executive Order on Bottled Water bans the purchase of bottled water with city funds while the Precautionary Purchasing Ordinance, \"requires city departments to purchase products that maximize post-consumer recycled content and recyclable or compostable materials, and that favor durability, repairability, and reuse.\" All of the aforementioned policies have had  large impacts on diversion rates and by the end of 2007, the City had reached 72 percent. However, it was clear that increased participation in the residential curbside collection program was desirable if San Francisco were to reach zero waste by 2020. According to Jack Macy, Commercial Zero Waste Coordinator for the City of San Francisco, if everyone in San Francisco participated in the program by separating all the materials accepted, a 90 percent diversion rate would be achievable. San Francisco realized that voluntary participation would not suffice, and in 2009, the Board of Supervisors passed the Mandatory Recycling and Composting Ordinance, requiring all persons in San Francisco to separate their recyclables, compostables and landfilled trash and to participate in recycling and composting programs.\nThe mandatory ordinance represents further investment in recycling infrastructure and in San Francisco's goal of zero waste. It has provided the leverage of law and participation rates have increased as a result. Since the mandatory ordinance went into effect, \"composting has increased by 45 percent, and the City is now sending nearly 600 tons of food scraps, soiled paper, and yard trimmings to Recology's compost facilities daily, up from 400 tons a year ago.\" In August 2010, San Francisco Mayor, Gavin Newsom, announced the city's diversion rate had reached 77 percent.\nSince construction and demolition sites already possessed a high diversion rate prior to the mandatory ordinance, the initial impact of the ordinance was mostly on homes and businesses.  Landlords expressed early concern over the challenge of finding space for bins, as well as over possible odors.  Despite these concerns, the ordinance remained popular overall, polling 85% prior to passing.  Before passing, the cap on fines was also lowered from $1,000 to $100 to address opposition to the possible size of fines.\nOf the , only  and  opposed 's proposal. Elsbernd was concerned about the preexisting problem of scavengers in trash cans and that the ordinance would worsen this problem. He was also concerned about fines being pursued heavily despite the assurance they would be lenient.\nAfter clauses making apartment owners responsible for their tenant's sorting were eliminated, the San Francisco Apartment Association took a neutral stance on the ordinance.\nTo aid San Francisco residents in a smooth transition to the new ordinance, the City and San Francisco's municipal solid waste collector, , offered free services including consultations and multi-lingual training sessions to educate residents. They also offered materials to aid the physical collection process: pails to collect compost, signs, and labels to instruct others on how to separate their recyclables, trash, and food scraps.\nThere are also financial incentives for reducing waste thrown in the trash bin. Both composting and recycling are less costly per month than the trash bill. The city newsletter highlighted this fact and suggested diverting more waste to recycling and composting bins, lowering trash bills by requesting less frequent trash collection, and using smaller trash bins to lessen the financial burden on residents.\nIn the event of \"egregious\" cases of noncompliance, or failure to separate recyclables, compostables, and trash, fines up to $100 for single-family homes and up to $1000 for large businesses are issued.\nSan Francisco's mandatory ordinance supports California's greenhouse gas reduction goals as expressed in the scoping plan for the  (AB 32).  Commercial recycling, composting, diverting waste from landfill sites (with an eventual zero waste goal), and addressing methane release at these sites are all stated goals of AB 32.  Recycling makes use of the embodied energy in recovered materials.  Using recycled material in the manufacture of products thus saves energy that would be consumed in the materials-extraction, pre-manufacture, and manufacture lifecycle stages of products.  Diversion of organic matter for other uses similarly reduces greenhouse gas emissions (see Food Waste Treatment section).  The AB 32 scoping plan also lists organics diverted from the waste stream as a potential source of biofuel production, which could further reduce greenhouse gas emissions if substituted for fossil fuels.\nAB 32 further directs that the California Air Resources Board (ARB) will work with the California Department of Resource Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle) to create a mandatory commercial recycling program, and partnerships between California and local government recycling and composting programs such as San Francisco's mandatory ordinance.  Statewide, such diversions from the waste stream are expected to conservatively produce the following greenhouse gas savings in millions of metric tons (MMT) of carbon dioxide equivalents:\nSan Francisco's Mandatory Recycling and Composting Ordinance also contributes to the  to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Most greenhouse gases attributed to waste are the result of energy consumed in lifecycle stages upstream from the landfill (materials extraction, pre-manufacture, manufacture, and transport), not from the landfill itself.  In 2001, San Francisco's actions to divert materials from Altamont landfill into recycled products reduced greenhouse gas emissions from these upstream lifecycle stages by the equivalent of 768,000 tons of carbon dioxide, vs. manufacturing these same products from virgin materials.  This shift away from virgin materials represents a 75-80% savings in net greenhouse gas emissions for paper, glass, copper, and steel, and a 97.5% savings for aluminum. The recycling of paper has an additional carbon sequestration effect through forest conservation. Diversion of organic material into composting also reduces greenhouse emissions, since applying compost as a soil amendment helps to sequester carbon.  In this vein, San Francisco's mandatory recycling and composting ordinance supports the city's 2002 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Resolution to reduce emissions to 20% less than 1990 levels by no later than 2012.\nSan Francisco's 2004 Climate Action Plan recommended mandatory residential and commercial recycling and composting policies to increase diversion of material from landfills. The Climate Action Plan projected estimated reductions in tons of emitted carbon dioxide equivalents from specific economic sectors and actions:\nAs stated in the history section, landfill limitations placed on San Francisco by Alameda County influenced San Francisco's decision to move toward greater diversion.  Alameda County has continued to move towards greater diversion, and on January 1, 2010 Alameda County implemented a new landfill ban targeted at professional landscapers.  This ban prohibits garbage contaminants (such as bottles or plastic film) in plant debris brought to plant debris disposal facilities, since these contaminants may require the organic waste facility to reject the entire contaminated load.  Similarly, the ban forbids plant debris to be disposed of in garbage.  The ban is backed by fines of up to $500 per offense for repeat offenders.\nOne of San Francisco's waste reduction measures, the city's Plastic Bag Reduction Ordinance (described in the history section), has achieved national and international attention.  Within a year of its implementation, Boston, Portland, and Phoenix were investigating such plastic bag bans, and city supervisor Ross Mirkarimi had fielded inquiries from Paris and London.  However, the Marin County suburb of Fairfax retreated from a similar ban when the plastic bag industry threatened legal action.  Mayor Mary Ann Maggiore stated that the city was too small to fight the suit.  On April 26, 2011, the San Francisco Bay Area county of Santa Clara also passed a plastic bag ban in unincorporated areas of the county, but this ban excludes restaurants and non-profit organizations.\n\n"},

CalRecycle was established in 2010 to replace the . It is known for administering the  program, among other responsibilities.\nThe original waste management agency, the State Solid Waste Management Board, was established in 1972. It was renamed the California Waste Management Board in 1982.\nThe California Integrated Waste Management Board (CIWMB) was established in 1989 under AB 939 introduced by  of the  and signed into law by Governor .\nThe CIWMB was one of six agencies under the  (abbreviated Cal/EPA, to distinguish it from the federal ). The CIWMB was led by a six-member policy-making Board. Four members of the Board were appointed by the governor, and each branch of the Legislature made one appointment. Board terms ran for up to four years.\nIn 2005, Governor  proposed to eliminate the CIWMB as well as 87 other state boards and commissions.   introduced Senate Bill (SB) 63 in January 2009 to dissolve the CIWMB; Governor  signed SB 63 into law in July 2009. The California Integrated Waste Management Board\u2014CIWMB became defunct on January 1, 2010.\nThe CIWMB's duties and responsibilities were transferred to the California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle), another agency within the , in January 2010. The functions of the beverage container recycling deposit/ programs established by the California Beverage Container Recycling and Litter Reduction Act (AB 2020, Margolin - 1986), or \"Bottle Bill,\" were consolidated from California Department of Conservation, Division of Recycling into the new CalRecycle.\nInstead of monthly meetings of a Board and Sub-Committees as was done under the CIWMB structure, CalRecycle holds a Monthly Public Meeting in the Byron Sher Auditorium at 1001 I Street in Sacramento with a live audio broadcast available. CalRecycle Monthly Public Meetings provide an overview of many pending and recently-made decisions, updates about ongoing department projects and work activities, and a general report from the Director of CalRecycle.\nMargo Reid Brown, who was Board Chair under the previous CIMWB structure, was appointed by Governor  as the first Chief Deputy Director and Acting Director of CalRecycle.\nCalRecycle Deputy Director Mark Leary (and Executive Director of the former CIWMB from 2001 to 2010 ) served as Acting Chief Deputy Director and Acting Director of CalRecycle.\nMark Leary was appointed by Governor  as Chief Deputy Director of CalRecycle and continued to serve as Acting Director of CalRecycle until Caroll Mortensen was appointed.\nCaroll Mortensen was the first Director of CalRecycle appointed by Governor  in October 2011, confirmed unanimously by the state senate in May 2012, and served until July 2015. Both Mark Leary (2011-2012) and Margo Reid Brown (2010-2011) were Acting Directors, but Mortensen was the first to be appointed Director of CalRecycle by the Governor. Mortensen continues as a Senior Environmental Scientist within the Legislative and External Affairs Office at CalRecycle.\nScott Smithline is the current Director of CalRecycle and was appointed by Governor  and confirmed unanimously by the state senate in July 2015. As director, Mr. Smithline leads efforts on waste reduction and recycling as well as oversight of waste disposal in order to protect public health and the environment. Before becoming Director, he served as the department's Assistant Director for Policy Development since 2011. Ken DeRosa is current Chief Deputy Director of CalRecycle and was appointed by Governor  in November 2012.\nWhen the CIWMB was established, California diverted only 10 percent of  out of  and into recycling and/or reuse projects. By 2007, the waste diversion rate had increased to 58 percent. The CIWMB's cooperative efforts with California's local  ( and ) in furtherance of AB 939's mandate to reach 50 percent waste diversion contributed to the rise.\nThe CIWMB worked to implement programs to seek \"a higher and better use\" for an estimated 92 million tons of waste generated each year in California. Specifically, the CIWMB provided grants and loans that helped California's recycling industry; used incentive grants and loans to help spur the private sector into developing new markets for recycled materials; cleaned up solid waste disposal sites; and cleared illegal waste  sites. The CIWMB also regulated California landfills; promoted the proper disposal of used ; promoted the reuse and recycling of ; coordinated the safe disposal of ; and encouraged the purchase of environmentally preferable devices.\nIn 2001, CIWMB became the first government agency to adopt \"Zero Waste\" as a strategic goal.\nBy 2017, the recycling rates for bottles and cans in California had fallen to their lowest point in almost a decade, and critics alleged CalRecycle was not sufficiently adjusting its subsidiary processing payments to changing market conditions.\nAccording to CalRecycle, organic waste takes up about a third of California's landfills  with food waste alone taking up about 15.5 percent. The decomposition of this organic waste in landfills contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions. Organic waste must be diverted from landfills and to Compostable Material Handling Facilities and Operations that are permitted to compost under CalRecycle regulation Title 14, Natural Resources\u2014Division 7, Chapter 3.1 approved April 4, 2003. This regulation was adopted as a means of implementing the provisions of the California Waste Management Act of 1989 relating to composting. California operations that only compost agricultural material and sell or give away more than 2,500 cubic yards or more a year, and operations and facilities that use agricultural and clean green material and sell or give away 1,000 cubic yards or more a year are required to abide by the regulations of chapter 3.1 and obtain a Compostable Materials Handling Facility Permit under Article 2, Section 17854, unless they meet certain exclusions. Handling of compostable materials during use as growth mediums on mushroom farms and Vermicomposting farms are not subject to these regulations.The regulations prohibit the composting of unprocessed mammalian tissue unless used for researching pathogen reduction, treated or untreated medical waste, and hazardous waste, and require minimization of odor, impacts, litter, noise, dust, and pathogens, as well as emissions of the permitted facilities.\n"},

The compost itself is beneficial for the land in many ways, including as a soil conditioner, a , addition of vital  or , and as a natural  for soil.  for erosion control, land and stream reclamation, wetland construction, and as landfill cover.\nAt the simplest level, the process of composting requires making a heap of wet organic matter (also called ), such as leaves, grass, and food scraps, and waiting for the materials to break down into  after a period of months. However, composting can also take place as a multi-step, closely monitored process with measured inputs of water, air, and carbon- and nitrogen-rich materials. The  process is aided by shredding the plant matter, adding water and ensuring proper aeration by regularly turning the mixture when open piles or \"windrows\" are used. ,  and other  further break up the material.  and fungi manage the chemical process by converting the inputs into heat, , and .\nComposting is an  (meaning that it requires the presence of air) of decomposing organic solid wastes. It can therefore be used to recycle organic material. The process involves decomposition of organic material into a -like material, known as compost, which is a good  for plants. Composting requires the following three components: human management, aerobic conditions, and development of internal biological heat.\nComposting organisms require four equally important ingredients to work effectively:\nCertain ratios of these materials will provide microorganisms to work at a rate that will heat up the pile. Active management of the pile (e.g. turning) is needed to maintain sufficient supply of oxygen and the right moisture level. The air/water balance is critical to maintaining high temperatures 130\u2013160\u00a0\u00b0F (54\u201371\u00a0\u00b0C) until the materials are broken down.\nThe most efficient composting occurs with an optimal carbon:nitrogen ratio of about 25:1.  focuses on retaining the heat to increase decomposition rate and produce compost more quickly. Rapid composting is favored by having a C/N ratio of ~30 or less. Above 30 the substrate is nitrogen starved, below 15 it is likely to outgas a portion of nitrogen as ammonia.\nNearly all plant and animal materials have both carbon and nitrogen, but amounts vary widely, with characteristics noted above (dry/wet, brown/green). Fresh grass clippings have an average ratio of about 15:1 and dry autumn leaves about 50:1 depending on species. Mixing equal parts by volume approximates the ideal C:N range. Few individual situations will provide the ideal mix of materials at any point. Observation of amounts, and consideration of different materials as a pile is built over time, can quickly achieve a workable technique for the individual situation.\nWith the proper mixture of water, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen, micro-organisms are able to break down organic matter to produce compost. The composting process is dependent on micro-organisms to break down organic matter into compost. There are many types of microorganisms found in active compost of which the most common are:\nIn addition,  not only ingest partly composted material, but also continually re-create aeration and drainage tunnels as they move through the compost.\nUnder ideal conditions, composting proceeds through three major phases:\nThere are many proponents of rapid composting that attempt to correct some of the perceived problems associated with traditional, slow composting. Many advocate that compost can be made in 2 to 3 weeks. Many such short processes involve a few changes to traditional methods, including smaller, more homogenized pieces in the compost, controlling carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C:N) at 30 to 1 or less, and monitoring the moisture level more carefully. However, none of these parameters differ significantly from the early writings of compost researchers, suggesting that, in fact, modern composting has not made significant advances over the traditional methods that take a few months to work. For this reason and others, many scientists who deal with carbon transformations are skeptical that there is a \"super-charged\" way to get nature to make compost rapidly.\nBoth sides may be right to some extent. The bacterial activity in rapid high heat methods breaks down the material to the extent that pathogens and seeds are destroyed, and the original feedstock is unrecognizable. At this stage, the compost can be used to prepare fields or other planting areas.  However, most professionals recommend that the compost be given time to cure before using in a nursery for starting seeds or growing young plants. The curing time allows fungi to continue the decomposition process and eliminating  substances.\nAn alternative approach is anaerobic fermentation, known as . It retains carbon bonds, is faster than decomposition, and for application to soil requires only rapid but thorough aeration rather than curing. It depends on sufficient carbohydrates in the treated material.\nComposting can destroy  or unwanted . Unwanted living plants (or ) can be discouraged by .

Straw and sawdust are common bedding materials. Non-traditional bedding materials are also used, including newspaper and chopped cardboard. The amount of manure composted on a livestock farm is often determined by cleaning schedules, land availability, and weather conditions. Each type of manure has its own physical, chemical, and biological characteristics. Cattle and horse manures, when mixed with bedding, possess good qualities for composting. Swine manure, which is very wet and usually not mixed with bedding material, must be mixed with straw or similar raw materials. Poultry manure also must be blended with carbonaceous materials - those low in nitrogen preferred, such as sawdust or straw.\n can  be added as an input to the composting process since human excreta is a nitrogen-rich organic material.

Adding urine to compost can increase temperatures and therefore increase its ability to destroy pathogens and unwanted seeds. Unlike feces, urine does not attract disease-spreading flies (such as  or ), and it does not contain the most hardy of pathogens, such as  eggs.\nCompost can be used as an additive to soil, or other matrices such as  and , as a  improver, supplying humus and nutrients. It provides a rich  as absorbent material (porous). This material contains moisture and soluble minerals, which provides support and .

Compost can be tilled directly into the soil or growing medium to boost the level of organic matter and the overall fertility of the soil. Compost that is ready to be used as an additive is dark brown or even black with an earthy smell.\nGenerally, direct seeding into a compost is not recommended due to the speed with which it may dry and the possible presence of  in immature compost that may inhibit germination, and the possible tie up of nitrogen by incompletely decomposed lignin. It is very common to see blends of 20\u201330% compost used for transplanting  at  stage or later.\nCompost can be used to increase plant immunity to diseases and pests.\nVarious approaches have been developed to handle different ingredients, locations, throughput and applications for the composted product.\nIndustrial-scale composting can be carried out in the form of , , , or .\n is the product or process of organic material degradation using various species of worms, usually , , and , to create a heterogeneous mixture of decomposing vegetable or food waste (excluding meat, dairy, fats, or oils), bedding materials, and vermicast.

When properly managed, they do not smell. The composting process in these toilets destroys pathogens to some extent. The amount of pathogen destruction depends on the temperature (mesophilic or thermophilic conditions) and composting time.\nComposting toilets with a large composting container (of the type  and derivations of it) are popular in United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Sweden. They are available as commercial products, as designs for self builders or as \"design derivatives\" which are marketed under various names.\n () larvae are able to rapidly consume large amounts of organic material when kept at around 30\u00a0\u00b0C. Black soldier fly larvae can reduce the dry matter of the organic waste by 73%  and convert 16\u201322% of the dry matter in the waste to biomass. The resulting compost still contains nutrients and can be used for  production, or further traditional composting or   The larvae are rich in fat and protein, and can be used as, for example, animal feed or  production. Enthusiasts have experimented with a large number of different waste products.\nBokashi is not composting as defined earlier, rather an alternative technology. It  (rather than decomposes) the input organic matter and feeds the result to the  (rather than producing a soil conditioner). The process involves adding  to the input in an airtight container kept at normal room temperature. These bacteria ferment  to , which preserves the input. After this is complete the preserve is mixed into soil, converting the lactic acid to , which enables soil life to consume the result.\n\nBokashi is typically applied to  from households, workplaces and catering establishments, because such waste normally holds a good proportion of carbohydrates; it is also applied to other organic waste by supplementing carbohydrates. Household containers (\"bokashi bins\") typically give a batch size of 5\u201310 kilograms (11\u201322\u00a0lb), accumulated over a few weeks. In horticultural settings batches can be orders of magnitude greater.Bokashi offers several advantages:\nThe importance of the first advantage should not be underestimated: the mass of any  depends on the energy it captures. Plants depend upon the soil ecosystem making nutrients available within . Therefore, the richer the ecosystem, the richer the plants. (Plants can also take up nutrients from added chemicals, but these are at odds with the purpose of composting).\nThe practice of making raised garden beds or mounds filled with rotting wood is also called  in German. It is in effect creating a  that is covered with soil.\nBenefits of  garden beds include water retention and warming of soil. Buried wood acts like a  as it decomposes, able to capture water and store it for later use by crops planted on top of the  bed.\nCompost teas are defined as water extracts leached from composted materials. Compost teas are generally produced from adding one volume of compost to 4\u201310 volumes of water, but there has also been debate about the benefits of aerating the mixture. Field studies have shown the benefits of adding compost teas to crops due to the adding of organic matter, increased nutrient availability and increased microbial activity. They have also been shown to have an effect on plant pathogens.\nWorm Hotels accommodate useful worm in ideal conditions.\nOrganic ingredients intended for composting can also be used to generate  through . This process stabilizes organic material. The residual material, sometimes in combination with  can be treated by a composting process before selling or giving away the compost.\nThere are process and product guidelines in Europe that date to the early 1980s (Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland) and only more recently in the UK and the US. In both these countries, private trade associations within the industry have established loose standards, some say as a stop-gap measure to discourage independent government agencies from establishing tougher consumer-friendly standards.\nThe USA is the only Western country that does not distinguish sludge-source compost from green-composts, and by default in the USA 50% of states expect composts to comply in some manner with the federal EPA 503 rule promulgated in 1984 for sludge products.\nCompost is regulated in Canada and Australia as well.\nMany countries such as  and some individual cities such as Seattle and  require food and yard waste to be sorted for composting ().\nLarge-scale composting systems are used by many urban areas around the world.\nComposting as a recognized practice dates to at least the early Roman Empire, and was mentioned as early as 's 160 BCE piece . Traditionally, composting involved piling organic materials until the next planting season, at which time the materials would have decayed enough to be ready for use in the soil. The advantage of this method is that little working time or effort is required from the composter and it fits in naturally with agricultural practices in temperate climates. Disadvantages (from the modern perspective) are that space is used for a whole year, some nutrients might be leached due to exposure to rainfall, and disease-producing organisms and insects may not be adequately controlled.\nComposting was somewhat modernized beginning in the 1920s in Europe as a tool for . The first industrial station for the transformation of urban organic materials into compost was set up in , Austria in the year 1921. Early frequent citations for propounding composting within farming are for the German-speaking world , founder of a farming method called , and , who was appointed on behalf of the government in  and supported the country 1950\u20131958 to set up a large humus organization in the fight against erosion and .\nIn the English-speaking world it was  who worked extensively in  on sustainable practices and  who was a huge proponent of composting. Composting was imported to America by various followers of these early European movements by the likes of  (founder of Rodale Organic Gardening), E.E. Pfeiffer (who developed scientific practices in biodynamic farming),  (founder of Walnut Acres in Pennsylvania), and  and  (who inspired the  of the 1960s). Coincidentally, some of the above met briefly in India - all were quite influential in the U.S. from the 1960s into the 1980s.\nThe term \"composting\" is used worldwide with differing meanings.\n\"Humanure\" is a  of  and , designating human excrement ( and ) that is recycled via composting for agricultural purposes. The term was first used in 1994 in a book by Joseph Jenkins that advocates the use of this  soil amendment. The term humanure is used by compost enthusiasts in the United States but not widely used elsewhere. Because the term \"humanure\" has no authoritative definition it is subject to various uses.

This involves increased use of life cycle inventory (LCI) and  (LCA) to help guide the use of packaging which reduces the  and .  It includes a look at the whole of the : from basic function, to marketing, and then through to end of life (LCA) and rebirth. Additionally, an eco-cost to value ratio can be useful\nThe goals are to improve the long term viability and  for  and the longevity of natural ecosystems. Sustainable packaging must meet the functional and economic needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Sustainability is not necessarily an end state but is a continuing process of improvement.\nSustainable packaging is a relatively new addition to the environmental considerations for packaging (see ). It requires more analysis and documentation to look at the package design, choice of materials, processing, and life-cycle. This is not just the vague \"green movement\" that many businesses and companies have been trying to include over the past years.  Companies implementing eco-friendly actions are reducing their , using more recycled materials and  reusing more package components.  They often encourage suppliers, contract packagers, and distributors to do likewise.\nFor example, researchers at the  are looking into using dairy-based films as an alternative to petroleum-based packaging.   Instead of being made of , these dairy-based films would be composed of proteins such as  and , which are found in milk.  The films would be  and offer better oxygen barriers than synthetic, chemical-based films.  More research must be done to improve the water barrier quality of the dairy-based film, but advances in sustainable packaging are actively being pursued.\n claims on packages need to be made (and read) with caution. Ambiguous  titles such as  and   can be confusing without specific definition. Some regulators, such as the US Federal Trade Commission, are providing guidance to packagers\nCompanies have long been reusing and recycling packaging when economically viable. Using minimal packaging has also been a common goal to help reduce costs. Recent years have accelerated these efforts based on social movements, consumer pressure, and regulation. All phases of packaging, distribution, and logistics are included.\nSustainable packaging is no longer focused on just recycling. Just as packaging is not the only eco target, although it is still top of mind for many. Right or wrong, packaging is frequently scrutinized and used as the measure of a company's overall sustainability, even though it may contribute only a small percentage to the total eco impact compared to other things, such as transportation, and water and energy use.\nThe criteria for ranking and comparing packaging based on their sustainability is an active area of development.  General guidance, metrics, checklists, and scorecards are being published by several groups.\nGovernment, , consumers, retailers, and packagers are considering several types of criteria.\nEach organization words the goals and targets a little differently. In general, the broad goals of sustainable packaging are:\nSpecific factors for  of packaging may include:\nThe chosen criteria are often used best as a basis of comparison for two or more similar packaging designs; not as an absolute success or failure.  Such a multi-variable comparison is often presented as a  (spider chart,  star chart, etc.).\nSome aspects of environmentally sound packaging are required by regulators while others are decisions made by individual packagers.  Investors, employees, management, and customers can influence corporate decisions and help set policies.  When investors seek to purchase stock, companies known for their positive environmental policy can be attractive.  Potential stockholders and investors see this as a solid decision: lower environmental risks lead to more capital at cheaper rates. Companies that highlight their environmental status to consumers can boost sales as well as product reputation. Going green  is often a sound investment that can pay off.\nThe process of engineering more environmentally acceptable packages can include consideration of the costs.  Some companies claim that their environmental packaging program is cost effective. Some alternative materials that are recycled/recyclable and/or less damaging to the environment can lead to companies incurring increased costs. Though this is common when any product begins to carry the true cost of its production (producer pays, producer responsibility laws, take-back laws). There may be an expensive and lengthy process before the new forms of packaging are deemed safe to the public, and approval may take up to two years. It is important to note here, that for most of the developed world, tightening legislation, and changes in major retailer demand (Walmart's Sustainable Packaging Scorecard for example) the question is no longer \"if\" products and packaging should become more sustainable, but how-to and how-soon to do it.\nEfforts toward \u201cgreener\u201d packaging are supported in the sustainability community; however, these are often viewed only as incremental steps and not as an end.  Some people foresee a true sustainable  that may be very different from today's:  greatly reduced energy usage, minimal ,  fewer ,     with , little , etc.\nLess packaging would be needed in a sustainable   economy, which means that fewer packaging options would exist and simpler packaging forms may be necessary.\n"},

The EPA is not a  department, but the administrator is normally given .\nThe EPA has its headquarters in , regional offices for each of the agency's ten , and 27 laboratories. The agency conducts , research, and education. It has the responsibility of maintaining and enforcing national standards under a variety of environmental laws, in consultation with state, tribal, and local governments. It delegates some permitting, monitoring, and enforcement responsibility to  and the . EPA enforcement powers include fines, , and other measures. The agency also works with industries and all levels of government in a wide variety of voluntary pollution prevention programs and energy conservation efforts.\nIn 2018, the agency had 14,172 full-time employees. More than half of EPA's employees are engineers, scientists, and environmental protection specialists; other employees include legal, public affairs, financial, and information technologists.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency can only act pursuant to statutes--the laws passed by Congress. Appropriations statutes authorize how much money the agency can spend each year to carry out the approved statutes. The agency has the power to issue regulations. A regulation interprets a statute, and EPA applies its regulations to various environmental situations and enforces the requirements. The agency must include a rationale of why a regulation is needed. Regulations can be challenged in federal courts, either  or , depending on the particular statutory provision.\nMany public health and environmental groups advocate for the agency and believe that it is creating a better world. Other critics believe that the agency commits government overreach by adding unnecessary regulations on business and property owners.\nBeginning in the late 1950s and through the 1960s, Congress reacted to increasing public concern about the impact that human activity could have on the environment. Senator  introduced a bill, the Resources and Conservation Act (RCA) of 1959, in the . The 1962 publication of  by  alerted the public about the detrimental effects on the environment of the indiscriminate use of .\nIn the years following, similar bills were introduced and hearings were held to discuss the state of the environment and Congress's potential responses. In 1968, a joint House\u2013Senate colloquium was convened by the chairmen of the Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, Senator , and the House Committee on Science and Astronautics, Representative , to discuss the need for and means of implementing a national environmental policy. In the colloquium, some members of Congress expressed a continuing concern over federal agency actions affecting the environment.\nThe  (NEPA) was modeled on the Resources and Conservation Act of 1959 (RCA). RCA would have established a Council on Environmental Quality in the , declared a national environmental policy, and required the preparation of an annual environmental report.\nPresident Nixon signed NEPA into law on January 1, 1970. The law created the  (CEQ) in the Executive Office of the President. NEPA required that a detailed statement of environmental impacts be prepared for all major federal actions significantly affecting the environment. The \"detailed statement\" would ultimately be referred to as an  (EIS).\nOn July 9, 1970, Nixon proposed an  that consolidated many environmental responsibilities of the federal government under one agency, a new Environmental Protection Agency. This proposal included merging antipollution programs from a number of departments, such as the combination of pesticide programs from the  and the . After conducting hearings during that summer, the House and Senate approved the proposal. The EPA was created 90 days before it had to operate, and officially opened its doors on December 2, 1970. The agency's first Administrator, , took the oath of office on December 4, 1970. In its first year, the EPA had a budget of $1.4 billion and 5,800 employees. At its start, the EPA was primarily a technical assistance agency that set goals and standards. Soon, new acts and amendments passed by Congress gave the agency its regulatory authority.\nEPA staff recall that in the early days there was \"an enormous sense of purpose and excitement\" and the expectation that \"there was this agency which was going to do something about a problem that clearly was on the minds of a lot of people in this country,\" leading to tens of thousands of resumes from those eager to participate in the mighty effort to clean up America's environment.\nWhen EPA first began operation, members of the private sector felt strongly that the environmental protection movement was a passing fad. Ruckelshaus stated that he felt pressure to show a public which was deeply skeptical about government's effectiveness, that EPA could respond effectively to widespread concerns about pollution.\nThe burning  in 1969 had led to a national outcry. In December 1970 a federal grand jury investigation led by U.S. Attorney  began, of water pollution allegedly being caused by about 12 companies in northeastern Ohio. It was the first grand jury investigation of water pollution in the area. The attorney general of the United States, John N. Mitchell, held a press Ccnference on  December 18, 1970, referencing new pollution control litigation, with particular reference to work with the new Environmental Protection Agency, and announcing the filing of a law suit that morning against the Jones and Laughlin Steel Corporation for discharging substantial quantities of cyanide into the Cuyahoga River near Cleveland. Jones filed the misdemeanor charges in District Court, alleging violations of the 1899 Rivers and Harbors Act.\nPartly based on such litigation experience, Congress enacted the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, better known as the . This act established a national framework for addressing water quality to be implemented by agency in partnership with the states.\nIn 1972, Congress also amended the  (FIFRA), requiring the newly formed EPA to measure every pesticide's risks against its potential benefits. Four years later, in October 1976, Congress passed the  (TSCA) which, like FIFRA, related to the manufacture, labeling and usage of commercial products rather than pollution. This act gave the EPA the authority to gather information on chemicals and require producers to test them, gave it the ability to regulate chemical production and use (with specific mention of PCBs), and required the agency to create the National Inventory listing of chemicals.\nCongress also enacted the  in 1976, significantly amending the . It tasked the EPA with setting national goals for waste disposal, conserving energy and natural resources, reducing waste, and ensuring environmentally sound management of waste. Accordingly, the agency developed regulations for solid and hazardous waste that were to be implemented in collaboration with states.\nIn 1980, Congress passed the , nicknamed \u201cSuperfund,\u201d which enabled the EPA to cast a wider net for parties responsible for sites contaminated by previous hazardous waste disposal (such as ) and established a funding mechanism for assessment and cleanup.\nIn April 1986, when the  occurred in , the EPA was tasked with identifying any impacts on the United States and keeping the public informed. Administrator  assembled an interagency team, including personnel from the , , and the  to monitor the situation. They held press conferences for 10 days. This same year, Congress passed the , which authorized the EPA to gather data on toxic chemicals and share this information with the public.\nThe EPA also researched the implications of stratospheric ozone depletion. Under the leadership of Administrator Lee Thomas, the EPA joined with several international organizations to perform a risk assessment of stratospheric ozone, which helped provide motivation for the Montreal Protocol, which was agreed to in August 1987.\nIn 1988, during his first presidential campaign,  was vocal about environmental issues. He appointed as his EPA Administrator , an environmentalist. Under Reilly's leadership, the EPA implemented voluntary programs and a cluster rule for multimedia regulation. At the time, the environment was increasingly being recognized as a regional issue, which was reflected in 1990 amendment of the  and new approaches by the agency.\nThe EPA is led by the Administrator, appointed following nomination by the President and approval from Congress. From February 2017 to July 2018,  served as the 14th Administrator. The current Administrator is former Deputy Administrator .\nCreating 10 EPA regions was an initiative that came from President Richard Nixon.  .\nEach EPA regional office is responsible within its states for implementing the agency's programs, except those programs that have been specifically delegated to states.\nEach regional office also implements programs on , except those programs delegated to tribal authorities.\nEPA has principal implementation authority for the following federal environmental laws:\nThere are additional laws where EPA has a contributing role or provides assistance to other agencies. Among these laws are:\nIt is worth noting that, in looking back in 2013 on the agency he helped shape from the beginning, Administrator William Ruckelshaus observed that a danger for EPA was that air, water, waste and other programs would be unconnected, placed in \"silos,\" a problem that persists more than 50 years later, albeit less so than at the start.\nThe testing system was originally developed in 1972 and used  designed to simulate driving during rush-hour in  during that era. Until 1984 the EPA reported the exact fuel economy figures calculated from the test. In 1984, the EPA began adjusting city (aka  or ) results downward by 10% and highway (aka HighWay Fuel Economy Test or HWFET) results by 22% to compensate for changes in driving conditions since 1972, and to better correlate the EPA test results with real-world driving. In 1996, the EPA proposed updating the Federal Testing Procedures to add a new higher-speed test (US06) and an air-conditioner-on test (SC03) to further improve the correlation of fuel economy and emission estimates with real-world reports. In December 2006 the updated testing methodology was finalized to be implemented in model year 2008 vehicles and set the precedent of a 12-year review cycle for the test procedures.\nIn February 2005, EPA launched a program called \"Your MPG\" that allows drivers to add real-world fuel economy statistics into a database on the EPA's fuel economy website and compare them with others and with the original EPA test results.\nThe EPA conducts fuel economy tests on very few vehicles. \"Just 18 of the EPA's 17,000 employees work in the automobile-testing department in Ann Arbor, Michigan, examining 200 to 250 vehicles a year, or roughly 15 percent of new models. As to that other 85 percent, the EPA takes automakers at their word\u2014without any testing-accepting submitted results as accurate.\" Two-thirds of the vehicles the EPA tests themselves are randomly selected and the remaining third is tested for specific reasons.\nAlthough originally created as a reference point for fossil-fueled vehicles,  have been used for estimating how many miles an electric vehicle will get on a single charge.\nThe  (NPDES) permit program addresses  by regulating  which discharge to US waters. Created in 1972 by the Clean Water Act, the NPDES permit program authorizes state governments to perform its many permitting, administrative, and enforcement aspects. As of 2018, EPA has approved 47 states to administer all or portions of the permit program. EPA regional offices manage the program in the remaining areas of the country. The Water Quality Act of 1987 extended NPDES permit coverage to  dischargers and municipal separate storm sewer systems. In 2016, there were 6,700 major point source NPDES permits in place and 109,000 municipal and industrial point sources with general or individual permits.\nEPA has the following seven project groups to protect the public from radiation.\nIn 1982 Congress charged that the EPA had mishandled the $1.6 billion program to clean up hazardous waste dumps  and demanded records from EPA director . She refused and became the first agency director in U.S. history to be cited for . The EPA turned the documents over to Congress several months later, after the White House abandoned its court claim that the documents could not be subpoenaed by Congress because they were covered by . At that point, Gorsuch resigned her post, citing pressures caused by the media and the congressional investigation. Critics charged that the EPA was in a shambles at that time. When Lee Thomas came to the agency in 1983 as Acting Assistant Administrator of the Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response, shortly before Gorsuch's resignation, six congressional committees were investigating the Superfund program. There were also two FBI agents performing an investigation for the Justice Department into possible destruction of documents.\nGorsuch, appointed by , resigned under fire in 1983. Gorsuch based her administration of the EPA on the  approach of downsizing federal agencies by delegating their functions and services to the individual states. She believed that the EPA was over-regulating business and that the agency was too large and not cost-effective. During her 22 months as agency head, she cut the budget of the EPA by 22%, reduced the number of cases filed against polluters, relaxed Clean Air Act regulations, and facilitated the spraying of restricted-use pesticides. She cut the total number of agency employees, and hired staff from the industries they were supposed to be regulating.  contended that her policies were designed to placate polluters, and accused her of trying to dismantle the agency.\nTSCA enables the EPA to require industry to conduct testing of chemicals, but the agency must balance such requirements with obligations to provide information to the public and ensure the protection of trade secrets and confidential business information (the legal term for proprietary information). Arising issues and problems from these overlapping obligations have been the subject of multiple critical reports by the . How much information the agency should have access to from industry, how much it should keep confidential, and how much it should reveal to the public is still contested. For example, according to TSCA, state officials are not allowed access to confidential business information collected by the EPA.\nIn April 2008, the  said that more than half of the nearly 1,600 EPA staff scientists who responded online to a detailed questionnaire reported they had experienced incidents of political interference in their work. The survey included chemists, toxicologists, engineers, geologists and experts in other fields of science. About 40% of the scientists reported that the interference had been more prevalent in the last five years than in previous years. The highest number of complaints came from scientists who were involved in determining the risks of cancer by chemicals used in food and other aspects of everyday life.\nEPA research has also been suppressed by career managers. Supervisors at EPA's National Center for Environmental Assessment required several paragraphs to be deleted from a peer-reviewed journal article about EPA's , which led two co-authors to have their names removed from the publication, and the corresponding author, Ching-Hung Hsu, to leave EPA \"because of the draconian restrictions placed on publishing\". EPA subjects employees who author scientific papers to , even if those papers are written on personal time.\nEPA employees have reported difficulty in conducting and reporting the results of studies on  due to industry and governmental pressure, and are concerned about the censorship of environmental reports.\nIn February 2017, U.S. representative  (R-Fla.) sponsored , a bill to abolish the EPA by 2018. According to Gaetz, \"The American people are drowning in rules and regulation promulgated by unelected bureaucrats. And the Environmental Protection Agency has become an extraordinary offender.\" The bill was co-sponsored by  (R-Ky.),  (R-Ms.) and  (R-Ga.).\nIn July 2005, an EPA report showing that auto companies were using loopholes to produce less fuel-efficient cars was delayed. The report was supposed to be released the day before a controversial energy bill was passed and would have provided backup for those opposed to it, but the EPA delayed its release at the last minute.\nIn 2007, the state of California sued the EPA for its refusal to allow California and 16 other states to raise fuel economy standards for new cars. EPA Administrator  claimed that the EPA was working on its own standards, but the move has been widely considered an attempt to shield the auto industry from environmental regulation by setting lower standards at the federal level, which would then preempt state laws. California governor , along with governors from 13 other states, stated that the EPA's actions ignored federal law, and that  California standards (adopted by many states in addition to California) were almost twice as effective as the  federal standards. It was reported that Stephen Johnson ignored his own staff in making this decision.\nAfter the federal government had bailed out  and  in the , the 2010  was released with an EPA fuel economy rating abnormally higher than its competitors. Independent road tests found that the vehicle did not out-perform its competitors, which had much lower fuel economy ratings. Later road tests found better, but inconclusive, results.\nIn March 2005, nine states (California, New York, New Jersey, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Maine, Connecticut, New Mexico and Vermont) sued the EPA. The EPA's  had determined that the EPA's regulation of  emissions did not follow the Clean Air Act, and that the regulations were influenced by top political appointees. The EPA had suppressed a study it commissioned by  which contradicted its position on mercury controls. The suit alleged that the EPA's rule exempting coal-fired power plants from \"maximum available control technology\" was illegal, and additionally charged that the EPA's system of  to lower average mercury levels would allow power plants to forego reducing mercury emissions, which they objected would lead to dangerous local hotspots of mercury contamination even if average levels declined. Several states also began to enact their own mercury emission regulations. Illinois's proposed rule would have reduced mercury emissions from power plants by an average of 90% by 2009. In 2008\u2014by which point a total of fourteen states had joined the suit\u2014the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that the EPA regulations violated the Clean Air Act.\nIn response, EPA announced plans to propose such standards to replace the vacated Clean Air Mercury Rule, and did so on March 16, 2011.\nIn December 2007, EPA Administrator  approved a draft of a document that declared that climate change imperiled the public welfare\u2014a decision that would trigger the first national mandatory global-warming regulations. Associate Deputy Administrator Jason Burnett e-mailed the draft to the White House. White House aides\u2014who had long resisted mandatory regulations as a way to address climate change\u2014knew the gist of what Johnson's finding would be, Burnett said. They also knew that once they opened the attachment, it would become a public record, making it controversial and difficult to rescind. So they did not open it; rather, they called Johnson and asked him to take back the draft. Johnson rescinded the draft; in July 2008, he issued a new version which did not state that  was danger to public welfare. Burnett resigned in protest.\nA $3 million mapping study on  was suppressed by EPA management during both the Bush and Obama administrations, and managers changed a key interagency report to reflect the removal of the maps.\nOn April 28, 2017, multiple climate change subdomains at EPA.gov began redirecting to a notice stating \"this page is being updated.\" The EPA issued a statement announcing the overhaul of its website to \"reflect the agency's new direction under President  and Administrator .\" The removed EPA climate change domains included extensive information on the EPA's work to mitigate climate change, as well as details of data collection efforts and indicators for climate change.\nIn August 2015, the  occurred when EPA contractors examined the level of pollutants such as  and  in a  mine, and accidentally released over three million gallons of waste water into Cement Creek and the .\nIn 2015, the  (IARC), a branch of the , cited research linking , an ingredient of the weed killer Roundup manufactured by the chemical company , to .  In March 2017, the presiding judge in a litigation brought about by people who claim to have developed glyphosate-related non-Hodgkin's lymphoma opened Monsanto emails and other documents related to the case, including email exchanges between the company and federal regulators.  According to an article in , the \"records suggested that Monsanto had ghostwritten research that was later attributed to academics and indicated that a senior official at the Environmental Protection Agency had worked to quash a review of Roundup\u2019s main ingredient, glyphosate, that was to have been conducted by the .\"  The records show that Monsanto was able to prepare \"a public relations assault\" on the finding after they were alerted to the determination by , the head of the EPA's cancer assessment review committee at that time,  months in advance.  Emails also showed that Rowland \"had promised to beat back an effort by the Department of Health and Human Services to conduct its own review.\"\nOn February 17, 2017, Scott Pruitt was appointed Administrator by President Donald Trump. The appointment was a seemingly controversial move, as Pruitt had spent most of his career challenging environmental regulations and policies. He did not have previous experience in the environmental protection field and had received financial support from the fossil fuel industry. In 2017 the  proposed a 31% cut to the EPA's budget to $5.7 billion from $8.1 billion and to eliminate a quarter of the agency jobs. However, this cut was not approved by Congress.\nPruitt resigned from the position on July 5, 2018, citing \"unrelenting attacks\" due to ongoing ethics controversies.\nThe EPA has been criticized for its lack of progress towards . Administrator  was criticized for her changes to President Bill Clinton's  12898 during 2001, removing the requirements for government agencies to take the poor and minority populations into special consideration when making changes to environmental legislation, and therefore defeating the spirit of the Executive Order. In a March 2004 report, the  of the agency concluded that the EPA \"has not developed a clear vision or a comprehensive strategic plan, and has not established values, goals, expectations, and performance measurements\" for environmental justice in its daily operations. Another report in September 2006 found the agency still had failed to review the success of its programs, policies and activities towards environmental justice. Studies have also found that poor and minority populations were underserved by the EPA's  program, and that this situation was worsening.\nMany environmental justice issues are local, and therefore difficult to address by a federal agency, such as the EPA. Without strong media attention, political interest, or 'crisis' status, local issues are less likely to be addressed at the federal level compared to larger, well publicized incidents.\nConflicting political powers in successive administrations: The White House maintains direct control over the EPA, and its enforcement actions are subject to the political agenda of who is in power. Republicans and Democrats differ in their approaches to environmental justice. While President Bill Clinton signed Executive Order 12898, the Bush administration did not develop a clear plan or establish goals for integrating environmental justice into everyday practices, affecting the motivation for environmental enforcement.\nThe EPA is responsible for preventing and detecting environmental crimes, informing the public of environmental enforcement, and setting and monitoring standards of air pollution, water pollution, hazardous wastes and chemicals. \"It is difficult to construct a specific mission statement given its wide range of responsibilities.\" It is impossible to address every environmental crime adequately or efficiently if there is no specific mission statement to refer to. The EPA answers to various groups, competes for resources, and confronts a wide array of harms to the environment. All of these present challenges, including a lack of resources, its self-policing policy, and a broadly defined legislation that creates too much discretion for EPA officers.\nThe EPA \"does not have the authority or resources to address injustices without an increase in federal mandates\" requiring private industries to consider the environmental ramifications of their activities.\nIn the latest  analysis of 15 federal agencies which receive the most  FOIA requests, published in 2015 (using 2012 and 2013 data, the most recent years available), the EPA earned a D by scoring 67 out of a possible 100 points, i.e. did not earn a satisfactory overall grade.\nOn July 17, 2019 the top scientific integrity official from the EPA, Francesca Grifo, was not permitted to testify by the EPA in front of a House committee hearing. The EPA offered to send a different representative in place of Grifo and accused the committee of \"dictating to the agency who they believe was qualified to speak.\" The hearing was to discuss the importance of allowing federal scientists and other employees to speak freely when and to whom they want to about their research without having to worry about any political consequences.\n"},

Ideally, the decision-making processes under such an approach would be a collaborative approach to planning and decision making that involves a broad range of stakeholders across all relevant governmental departments, as well as industry representatives, environmental groups, and community. This approach ideally supports a better exchange of information, development of conflict-resolution strategies and improved regional conservation. Religions also play an important role in the conservation of the environment.\nMany of the earth's resources are especially vulnerable because they are influenced by human impacts across . As a result of this, many attempts are made by countries to develop agreements that are signed by multiple governments to prevent damage or manage the impacts of human activity on natural resources. This can include agreements that impact factors such as climate, oceans, rivers and air pollution. These international environmental agreements are sometimes legally binding documents that have legal implications when they are not followed and, at other times, are more agreements in principle or are for use as codes of conduct. These agreements have a long history with some multinational agreements being in place from as early as 1910 in Europe, America and Africa. Some of the most well-known international agreements include the  and the .\nDiscussion concerning environmental protection often focuses on the role of government, legislation, and law enforcement. However, in its broadest sense, environmental protection may be seen to be the responsibility of all the people and not simply that of government. Decisions that impact the environment will ideally involve a broad range of stakeholders including industry, indigenous groups, environmental group and community representatives. Gradually, environmental decision-making processes are evolving to reflect this broad base of stakeholders and are becoming more collaborative in many countries.\nMany constitutions acknowledge  is recognised as having some of the greatest biodiversity of any African country. Almost 40% of the land has been established into a network of protected areas, including several national parks.

In the year 1948, Serengeti has officially established the first national park for wild cats in East Africa. Since 1983, there has been a more broad-reaching effort to manage environmental issues at a national level, through the establishment of the National Environment Management Council (NEMC) and the development of an environmental act. In 1998 Environment Improvement Trust (EIT) start working for environment & forest protection in India from a small city Sojat. Founder of Environment Improvement Trust is CA Gajendra Kumar Jain working with volunteers.\nDivision of the biosphere is the main government body that oversees protection. It does this through the formulation of policy, coordinating and monitoring environmental issues, environmental planning and policy-oriented environmental research. The National Environment Management Council (NEMC) is an institution that was initiated when the National Environment Management Act was first introduced in year 1983. This council has the role to advise governments and the international community on a range of environmental issues. The NEMC the following purposes: provide technical advice; coordinate technical activities; develop enforcement guidelines and procedures; assess, monitor and evaluate activities that impact the environment; promote and assist environmental information and communication; and seek advancement of scientific knowledge.\nThe National Environment Policy of 1997 acts as a framework for environmental decision making in Tanzania. The policy objectives are to achieve the following:\nTanzania is a signatory to a significant number of international conventions including the Rio Declaration on Development and Environment 1992 and the Convention on Biological Diversity 1996. The Environmental Management Act, 2004, is the first comprehensive legal and institutional framework to guide environmental-management decisions. The policy tools that are parts of the act include the use of environmental-impact assessments, strategics environmental assessments, and taxation on pollution for specific industries and products. The effectiveness of shifting of this act will only become clear over time as concerns regarding its implementation become apparent based on the fact that, historically, there has been a lack of capacity to enforce environmental laws and a lack of working tools to bring environmental-protection objectives into practice.\nFormal environmental protection in China House was first stimulated by the 1972  held in Stockholm, Sweden. Following this, they began establishing environmental protection agencies and putting controls on some of its industrial waste. China was one of the first developing countries to implement a sustainable development strategy. In 1983 the State Council announced that environmental protection would be one of China's basic national policies and in 1984 the National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA) was established. Following severe flooding of the Yangtze River basin in 1998, NEPA was upgraded to the State Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) meaning that environmental protection was now being implemented at a ministerial level. In 2008, SEPA became known by its current name of  (MEP).\nEnvironmental pollution and ecological degradation has resulted in economic losses for China. In 2005, economic losses (mainly from air pollution) were calculated at 7.7% of China's GDP. This grew to 10.3% by 2002 and the economic loss from water pollution (6.1%) began to exceed that caused by air pollution.\nChina has been one of the top performing countries in terms of GDP growth (9.64% in the past ten years). However, the high economic growth has put immense pressure on its environment and the environmental challenges that China faces are greater than most countries. In 2010 China was ranked 121st out of 163 countries on the .\nChina has taken initiatives to increase its protection of the environment and combat environmental degradation:\nRapid growth in GDP has been China's main goal during the past three decades with a dominant development model of inefficient resource use and high pollution to achieve high GDP. For China to develop sustainably, environmental protection should be treated as an integral part of its economic policies.\nQuote from Shengxian Zhou, head of MEP (2009): \"Good economic policy is good environmental policy and the nature of environmental problem is the economic structure, production form and develop model.\"\nEnvironmental protection has become an important task for the institutions of the  after the  for the  ratification by all of its member states.

Brazil is home to vast biological diversity, first among the  of the world, having between 15%-20% of the 1.5 million globally described species.\nThe organization in charge of environment protection is the Brazilian Ministry of the Environment (in Portuguese: Minist\u00e9rio do Meio Ambiente, MMA). It was first created in the year 1973 with the name Special Secretariat for the Environment (Secretaria Especial de Meio Ambiente), changing names several times, and adopting the final name in the year 1999. The Ministry is responsible for addressing the following issues:\nIn 2011, protected areas of the Amazon covered 2,197,485 km2 (an area larger than Greenland), with conservation units, like national parks, accounting for just over half (50.6%) and indigenous territories representing the remaining 49.4%.\nWith over 200,000 different species,  is home to 10\u201312% of the world's biodiversity, ranking first in  biodiversity and second in \u2014one estimate indicates that over 50% of all animal and plant species live in Mexico.\nThe history of environmental policy in Mexico started in the 1940s with the enactment of the Law of Conservation of Soil and Water (in Spanish: Ley de Conservaci\u00f3n de Suelo y Agua). Three decades later, at the beginning of the 1970s, the Law to Prevent and Control Environmental Pollution was created (Ley para Prevenir y Controlar la Contaminaci\u00f3n Ambiental).\nIn the year 1972 was the first direct response from the federal government to address eminent health effects from environmental issues. It established the administrative organization of the Secretariat for the Improvement of the Environment (Subsecretar\u00eda para el Mejoramiento del Ambiente) in the Department of Health and Welfare.\nThe Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources (Secretar\u00eda del Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales, ) is Mexico's environment ministry. The Ministry is responsible for addressing the following issues:\nIn November 2000 there were 127 ; currently there are 174, covering an area of 25,384,818 hectares, increasing federally protected areas from 8.6% to 12.85% its land area.\nIn 2008, there was 98,487,116  of terrestrial protected area, covering 12.8% of the land area of . The 2002 figures of 10.1% of terrestrial area and 64,615,554 ha of protected marine area were found to poorly represent about half of Australia's 85 bioregions.\nEnvironmental protection in Australia could be seen as starting with the formation of the first National Park, , in 1879. More progressive environmental protection had it start in the 1960s and 1970s with major international programs such as the  in 1972, the Environment Committee of the  in 1970, and the  of 1972. These events laid the foundations by increasing public awareness and support for regulation. State environmental legislation was irregular and deficient until the Australian Environment Council (AEC) and Council of Nature Conservation Ministers (CONCOM) were established in 1972 and 1974, creating a forum to assist in coordinating environmental and conservation policies between states and neighbouring countries. These councils have since been replaced by the Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council (ANZECC) in 1991 and finally the Environment Protection and Heritage Council (EPHC) in 2001.\nAt a national level, the  is the primary environmental protection legislation for the Commonwealth of Australia. It concerns matters of national and international environmental significance regarding flora, fauna, ecological communities and cultural heritage. It also has jurisdiction over any activity conducted by the Commonwealth, or affecting it, that has significant environmental impact.\nThe act covers eight main areas:\nThere are several Commonwealth protected lands due to partnerships with traditional native owners, such as , extraordinary biodiversity such as , or managed cooperatively due to cross-state location, such as the .\nAt a state level, the bulk of environmental protection issues are left to the responsibility of the state or territory. Each state in Australia has its own environmental protection legislation and corresponding agencies. Their jurisdiction is similar and covers point-source pollution, such as from industry or commercial activities, land/water use, and waste management. Most protected lands are managed by states and territories with state legislative acts creating different degrees and definitions of protected areas such as wilderness, national land and marine parks, state forests, and conservation areas. States also create regulation to limit and provide general protection from air, water, and sound pollution.\nAt a local level, each city or regional council has responsibility over issues not covered by state or national legislation. This includes non-point source, or diffuse pollution, such as sediment pollution from construction sites.\nAustralia ranks second place on the UN 2010  and one of the lowest debt to  ratios of the developed economies. This could be seen as coming at the cost of the environment, with Australia being the world leader in coal exportation and species extinctions. Some have been motivated to proclaim it is Australia's responsibility to set the example of environmental reform for the rest of the world to follow.\nAt a national level, the  is responsible for environmental policy and the  addresses .

The pollution in Switzerland is mainly the pollution caused by vehicles and the litteration by tourists.\nSince 1969, the  (EPA) has been working to protect the environment and human health.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is an independent public body under the aegis of the Department of Communications, Climate Action & Environment established under the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992.\nAll US states have their own state-level departments of environmental protection, which may issue regulations more stringent than the federal ones.\nIn January 2010, EPA Administrator  published via the official EPA blog her \"Seven Priorities for EPA's Future\", which were (in the order originally listed):\nAs of 2019, it is unclear whether these still represent the agency's active priorities, as Jackson departed in February 2013, and the page has not been updated in the interim.\nThe Constitution of India has a number of provisions demarcating the responsibility of the Central and State governments towards Environmental Protection. The state's responsibility with regard to environmental protection has been laid down under article 48-A of our constitution which stated that \" The states shall endeavor to protect and improve the environment and to safeguard the forest and wildlife of the country\".\nEnvironmental protection has been made a fundamental duty of every citizen of India under Article 51-A (g) of the constitution which says \"It shall be the duty of every citizen of India to protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers, and wildlife and to have compassion for living creatures\".\nArticle 21 of the constitution is a fundamental right, which states that \"No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to the procedure established by law\".\nThere are many works of literature that contain the themes of environmental protection but some have been fundamental to its evolution. Several pieces such as  by ,  by , and  by Rachel Carson have become classics due to their far reaching influences.\nThe subject of environmental protection is present in fiction as well as non-fictional literature. Books such as  and  have environmental protection as subjects whereas  has become a popular metaphor for environmental protection. \"The Limits of Trooghaft\" by Desmond Stewart is a short story that provides insight into human attitudes towards animals.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_recycling", "title": "PlasticrecyclingWikipedia", "body": " is the process of recovering  or   and reprocessing the material into useful products. Since the majority of plastic is non-,  is a part of global efforts to reduce plastic in the waste stream, especially the approximately 8 million metric tonnes of  that enters the Earth's ocean every year.\nCompared with lucrative , and similar to the low value of , plastic polymers recycling is often more challenging because of low density and low value. There are also numerous technical hurdles to overcome when recycling plastic.  are responsible for sorting and processing plastics. As of 2019, due to limitations in their economic viability, these facilities have struggled to make a meaningful contribution to the plastic supply chain.\nWhen different  are melted together, they tend to , like oil and water, and set in these layers. The  cause structural weakness in the resulting material, meaning that  are useful in only limited applications. The two most widely manufactured plastics,  and , behave this way, which limits their utility for recycling. Each time plastic is recycled, additional virgin materials must be added to help improve the integrity of the material. So, even recycled plastic has new plastic material added in. The same piece of plastic can only be recycled about 2\u20133 times before its quality decreases to the point where it can no longer be used.\nRecently, the use of  as \"molecular stitches\" or \"macromolecular welding flux\" has been proposed to overcome the difficulties associated with phase separation during recycling. Certain , such as PLA, recycled by breaking down plastic polymers into their chemical building blocks, can be recycled hundreds of times.\nThe use of  or plastics which can be organically recycled or can be composted in industrial composting is increasing for certain short-lived packaging applications.\nThe percentage of plastic that can be fully recycled, rather than downcycled or go to waste, can be increased when manufacturers of packaged goods minimize mixing of packaging materials and eliminate contaminants. The  has issued a \"Design Guide for Recyclability\".\nBroadly, there are two major ways to recycle plastic: (1) mechanical recycling (\"chop and wash\"), where the plastic is washed, ground into powders and melted, and (2) chemical recycling, where the plastic is broken down into basic components.\nBefore recycling, most plastics are sorted according to their resin type. In the past, plastic reclaimers used the  (RIC), a method of categorization of polymer types, which was developed by the  in 1988. , commonly referred to as PET, for instance, has a resin code of 1.  Most plastic reclaimers do not rely on the RIC now; they use various sorting systems to identify the resin, ranging from manual sorting and picking of plastic materials to mechanized automation processes that involve shredding, sieving, separation by rates of density i.e. air, liquid, or magnetic, and complex spectrophotometric distribution technologies e.g. UV/VIS, NIR, Laser, etc. Some plastic products are also separated by color before they are recycled.\nAfter sorting, for mechanical recycling the plastic recyclables are then shredded.  These shredded fragments then undergo processes to eliminate impurities like paper labels.  This material is melted and often  into the form of pellets which are then used to manufacture other products. The highest quality purification may be referred to as \"regeneration\".\nScientists have estimated that the potential commodity value of waste plastic may be in excess of $300 per ton when used in process pathways yielding high-value chemical products or to produce electricity in efficient IGCC () processes.\nPlastic pyrolysis can convert petroleum-based waste streams such as plastics into fuels and carbons.\nGiven below is the list of suitable plastic raw materials for pyrolysis:\nHeat compression takes all unsorted, cleaned plastic in all forms, from soft plastic bags to hard , and mixes the load in tumblers (large rotating drums resembling giant ). The most obvious benefit to this method is that all plastic is recyclable, not just matching forms. However, criticism rises from the energy costs of rotating the drums, and heating the post-melt pipes.\nDistributed recycling of plastics using  (or DRAM) can include mechanical grinding to make granules for 1) fused granular fabrication, 2) heated  printing, 3) 3-D printed molds coupled to  and 4)  filament production in a  to fused filament fabrication. For some waste plastics, technical devices called  enable a form of distributed recycling by making 3-D printing filament. Preliminary  (LCA) indicates that such distributed recycling of  to make filament of  in rural regions is energetically favorable to either using virgin resin or conventional recycling processes because of reductions in transportation energy.\nFor some polymers, it is possible to convert them back into monomers, for example, PET can be treated with an alcohol and a catalyst to form a dialkyl terephthalate. The terephthalate diester can be used with ethylene glycol to form a new  polymer, thus making it possible to use the pure polymer again.\nAn estimated 60 companies are pursuing chemical recycling as of 2019.\nIn 2019,  announced initiatives for  of polyesters and polymer gasification to  designed to handle a greater variety of used material.\nIn 2019, Brightmark Energy in the United States began building a facility to convert 100,000 tons of mixed plastic per into diesel,  blend stocks, and ; the company plans to expand into building another plant which can process an additional 800,000 tons of plastic per year. The company has said that the economics have a significant margin of safety from price declines.\nA process has also been developed in which many kinds of plastic can be used as a  source (in place of ) in the recycling of scrap . There are also possibilities for better recycling of mixed plastics, avoiding the need for expensive/inefficient separation of the plastic waste stream. One such method is called compatibilization which uses special chemical bridging agents called compatibilizers to maintain the quality of mixed polymers.\nPost-consumer  (PET or PETE) containers are sorted into different color fractions and baled for onward sale.  PET recyclers further sort the baled bottles and they are washed and flaked (or flaked and then washed).  Non-PET fractions such as caps and labels are removed during this process.  The clean flake is dried.  Further treatment can take place e.g. melt filtering and pelletizing or various treatments to produce food-contact-approved recycled PET (RPET). This sorted post-consumer PET waste is crushed, chopped into flakes, pressed into bales, and offered for sale.\nOne use for this recycled PET is to create fabrics to be used in the . The fabrics are created by spinning the PET flakes into thread and yarn. This is done just as easily as creating polyester from brand new PET. The recycled PET thread or yarn can be used either alone or together with other fibers to create a very wide variety of fabrics. Traditionally these fabrics are used to create strong, durable, rough products, such as jackets, coats, shoes, bags, hats, and accessories since they are usually too rough for direct skin contact and can cause irritation. However, these types of fabrics have become more popular as a result of the public's growing awareness of environmental issues. Numerous fabric and clothing manufacturers have capitalized on this trend.\nOther major outlets for RPET are new containers (food-contact or non-food-contact) produced either by (injection stretch blow) moulding into bottles and jars or by thermoforming APET sheet to produce clamshells, blister packs and collation trays.  These applications used 46% of all RPET produced in Europe in 2010. Other applications, such as strapping tape, injection-moulded engineering components and building materials, account for 13% of the 2010 RPET production.\nIn the United States, the recycling rate for PET packaging was 31% in 2013, according to a report from The National Association for PET Container Resources (NAPCOR) and The Association of Postconsumer Plastic Recyclers (APR). A total of 1.798 billion pounds was collected and 475 million pounds of recycled PET used out of a total of 5.764 billion pounds of PET bottles.\nPlastic #2, high-density polyethylene () is a commonly recycled plastic. HDPE's highly crystalline structure makes it a strong, high density, moderately stiff plastic. HDPE Thermoplastic materials become liquid at their melting point\u2014around 130\u00a0\u00b0C. A major benefit of thermoplastics is that they can be heated to melting point, cooled, and reheated again without significant degradation. Instead of burning, thermoplastics like PE (Polyethylene) liquefy, allowing them to be easily extruded or  and turned into brand new . Often it is typically  into , tables, roadside curbs, benches, truck cargo liners, trash receptacles, stationery (e.g. rulers) and other durable plastic products and is usually in demand.\nMost polystyrene products are not recycled due to the lack of incentive to invest in the compactors and logistical systems required. As a result, manufacturers cannot obtain sufficient scrap. Expanded polystyrene (EPS) scrap can easily be added to products such as EPS insulation sheets and other EPS materials for construction applications. When it is not used to make more EPS, foam scrap can be turned into clothes hangers, park benches, flower pots, toys, rulers, stapler bodies, seedling containers, picture frames, and architectural molding from recycled PS.\nRecycled EPS is also used in many metal casting operations.  is made from EPS that is combined with cement to be used as an insulating amendment in the making of concrete foundations and walls.  Since 1993, American manufacturers have produced insulating concrete forms made with approximately 80% recycled EPS.\nThe white plastic polystyrene  used as packing material are often accepted by shipping stores for reuse.\nSuccessful trials in  have shown that plastic films recovered from mixed municipal waste streams can be recycled into useful household products such as .\nSimilarly,  such as mulch film,  and  bags are being diverted from the waste stream and successfully recycled into much larger products for industrial applications such as .  Historically, these agricultural plastics have primarily been either landfilled or burned on-site in the fields of individual farms.\n reports that Dr. S. Madhu of the  Highway Research Institute, , has formulated a road surface that includes recycled plastic: aggregate,  (asphalt) with plastic that has been shredded and melted at a temperature below 220\u00a0\u00b0C (428\u00a0\u00b0F) to avoid pollution.  This road surface is claimed to be very durable and monsoon rain resistant.  The plastic is sorted by hand, which is economical in India. The test road used 60\u00a0kg of plastic for an approximately 500-meter-long, 8-meter-wide, two-lane road.  The process chops thin-film road-waste into a light fluff of tiny flakes that hot-mix plants can uniformly introduce into viscous bitumen with a customized dosing machine.  Tests at both Bangalore and the Indian Road Research Centre indicate that roads built using this 'KK process' will have longer useful lives and better resistance to cold, heat, cracking, and rutting, by a factor of 3.\nSome new innovations propose plastics much easier recycled, like 2019 . (PDK)\nMajor plastic recycling equipment companies include . Equipment such as shredders and granulators may be sold by a variety of companies.\nIn 2016, startup  created a marketplace called Bazar for selling machines and products targeted to DIY designers to recycle plastic.\nThe quantity of post-consumer plastics recycled has increased every year since at least 1990, but rates lag far behind those of other items, such as newspaper (about 80%) and  (about 70%). Overall, U.S. post-consumer  for 2008 was estimated at 33.6 million tons; 2.2 million tons (6.5%) were recycled and 2.6 million tons (8%) were burned for energy; 28.9 million tons, or 86%, were discarded in landfills.\nAs of 2015, approximately 6.3 billion tons of plastic waste had been generated, around 9% of which had been recycled, 12% was incinerated, and 79% was accumulated in landfills or the natural environment. In 2016 only 14% of plastic waste was recycled globally. According to the EPA, the recycling rate for plastics overall was 9.1% in 2015. Certain products have higher rates, such as PET bottles and jars at 29.9%, and HDPE natural bottles at 30.3%. These rates are lower than certain other materials, like steel cans, that had an estimated recycling rate of 71.3% in 2015.\nJapan's plastic waste utilization rate stood at 39% in 1996, increasing to 73% in 2006, 77% in 2011, 83% in 2014 and 86% in 2017, according to the nation's Plastic Waste Management Institute.\nIn 2008, the price of PET dropped from $370/ton in the US to $20 in November. PET prices had returned to their long-term averages by May 2009.\nSeven groups of plastic polymers, each with specific properties, are used worldwide for packaging applications (see table below). Each group of plastic polymer can be identified by its plastic identification code (PIC), usually a number or a letter abbreviation. For instance, low-density polyethylene can be identified by the number \"4\" or the letters \"LDPE\". The PIC appears inside a three-chasing-arrow recycling symbol. The symbol is used to indicate whether the plastic can be recycled into new products.\nThe PIC was introduced by the Society of the Plastics Industry, Inc., to provide a uniform system for the identification of various polymer types and to help recycling companies separate various plastics for reprocessing. Manufacturers of plastic products are required to use PIC labels in some countries/regions and can voluntarily mark their products with the PIC where there are no requirements. Consumers can identify the plastic types based on the codes usually found at the base or at the side of the plastic products, including food/chemical packaging and containers. The PIC is usually not present on packaging films, since it is not practical to collect and recycle most of this type of waste.\nThe  reported that China, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam dump more plastic in the sea than all other countries combined.   reported that China dumps 30% of all plastics in the ocean, followed by Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Egypt, Malaysia, Nigeria and Bangladesh.\nIn 2015, the United States produced 34.5 million tons of plastic, which was about 13% of total waste. About 9% of that was recycled. Most of the waste stream is biodegradable but plastic though only 13% of the waste stream is persistent and accumulates.\nLow national plastic recycling rates have been due to the complexity of sorting and processing, unfavorable economics, and consumer confusion about which plastics can actually be recycled. Part of the confusion has been due to the use of the , which is only found on a subset of plastic products, and which includes the  as part of its design. The resin identification code is stamped or printed on the bottom of containers and surrounded by a triangle of arrows. (See the table in .) The intent of these symbols was to make it easier to identify the type of plastics used to make a particular container and to indicate that the plastic is potentially recyclable. The question that remains is which types of plastics can be recycled by local recycling centers. In many communities, not all types of plastics are accepted for sidewalk recycling collection programs due to the high processing costs and complexity of the equipment required to recycle certain materials. There is also sometimes a seemingly low demand for the recycled product depending on a recycling center's proximity to entities seeking recycled materials. Another major barrier is that the cost to recycle certain materials and the corresponding market price for those materials sometimes does not present any opportunity for profit. The best example of this is polystyrene (commonly called styrofoam), although some communities, like , are moving toward banning the distribution of polystyrene containers by local food and coffee businesses.\n"},

The  or other reuse of \u2014such as  or \u2014is also a form of recycling. Materials to be recycled are either delivered to a household recycling center or picked up from curbside bins, then sorted, cleaned, and reprocessed into new materials destined for manufacturing new products.\nIn the strictest sense, recycling of a material would produce a fresh supply of the same material\u2014for example, used office paper would be converted into new office paper or used  foam into new polystyrene. This is accomplished when recycling certain types of materials, such as metal cans, which can become a can again and again, indefinitely, without losing purity in the product. However, this is often difficult or too expensive (compared with producing the same product from raw materials or other sources), so \"recycling\" of many products or materials involves their  in producing different materials (for example, ) instead. Another form of recycling is the  of certain materials from complex products, either due to their intrinsic value (such as lead from , or gold from ), or due to their hazardous nature (e.g., removal and reuse of  from  and ).\nRecycling has been a common practice for most of human history, with recorded advocates as far back as  in the fourth century BC. During periods when resources were scarce and hard to come by, archaeological studies of ancient waste dumps show less household waste (such as ash, broken tools, and pottery)\u2014implying more waste was being recycled in the absence of new material.\nIn  times, there is evidence of scrap bronze and other metals being collected in Europe and melted down for continuous reuse. Paper recycling was first recorded in 1031 when Japanese shops sold repulped paper. In Britain dust and ash from wood and coal fires was collected by \"\" and  as a base material used in brick making. The main driver for these types of recycling was the economic advantage of obtaining recycled feedstock instead of acquiring virgin material, as well as a lack of public waste removal in ever more densely populated areas. In 1813,  developed the process of turning rags into \"\" and \"\" wool in Batley, Yorkshire. This material combined recycled fibers with virgin . The  shoddy industry in towns such as Batley and Dewsbury lasted from the early 19th century to at least 1914.\nIndustrialization spurred demand for affordable materials; aside from rags, ferrous  metals were coveted as they were cheaper to acquire than virgin ore. Railroads both purchased and sold scrap metal in the 19th century, and the growing steel and automobile industries purchased scrap in the early 20th century. Many secondary goods were collected, processed and sold by peddlers who scoured dumps and city streets for discarded machinery, pots, pans, and other sources of metal. By , thousands of such peddlers roamed the streets of American cities, taking advantage of market forces to recycle post-consumer materials back into industrial production.\nBeverage bottles were recycled with a refundable deposit at some drink manufacturers in Great Britain and Ireland around 1800, notably . An official recycling system with refundable  was established in Sweden for bottles in 1884 and aluminum beverage cans in 1982; the law led to a recycling rate for beverage containers of 84\u201399 percent depending on type, and a glass bottle can be refilled over 20 times on average.\nNew chemical industries created in the late 19th century both invented new materials (e.g.  [1907]) and promised to transform valueless into valuable materials. Proverbially, you could not \u2014until the US firm Arthur D. Little published in 1921 \"On the Making of Silk Purses from Sows' Ears\", its research proving that when \"chemistry puts on overalls and gets down to business ... new values appear. New and better paths are opened to reach the goals desired.\"\nRecycling (or \"salvage\", as it was then usually known) was a major issue for governments throughout . Financial constraints and significant material shortages due to war efforts made it necessary for countries to reuse goods and recycle materials. These resource shortages caused by the , and other such world-changing occurrences, greatly encouraged recycling. The struggles of war claimed much of the material resources available, leaving little for the civilian population. It became necessary for most homes to recycle their waste, as recycling offered an extra source of materials allowing people to make the most of what was available to them. Recycling household materials meant more resources for war efforts and a better chance of victory. Massive government promotion campaigns, such as the  in Britain and the  campaign in the United States, were carried out on the  in every combative nation, urging citizens to donate metal, paper, rags, and rubber as a matter of patriotism.\nA considerable investment in recycling occurred in the 1970s, due to rising energy costs. Recycling aluminium uses only 5% of the energy required by virgin production; glass, paper and other metals have less dramatic but very significant energy savings when recycled feedstock is used.\nAlthough consumer electronics such as the television have been popular since the 1920s, recycling of them was almost unheard of until early 1991. The first electronic waste recycling scheme was implemented in Switzerland, beginning with collection of old refrigerators but gradually expanding to cover all devices. After these schemes were set up, many countries did not have the capacity to deal with the sheer quantity of e-waste they generated or its hazardous nature. They began to export the problem to developing countries without enforced environmental legislation. This is cheaper, as recycling computer monitors in the United States costs 10 times more than in China. Demand in Asia for electronic waste began to grow when scrap yards found that they could extract valuable substances such as copper, silver, iron, silicon, nickel, and gold, during the recycling process. The 2000s saw a large increase in both the sale of electronic devices and their growth as a waste stream: in 2002, e-waste grew faster than any other type of waste in the EU. This caused investment in modern, automated facilities to cope with the influx of redundant appliances, especially after strict laws were implemented in 2003.\nAs of 2014, the  had about 50% of world share of the waste and recycling industries, with over 60,000 companies employing 500,000 persons, with a turnover of \u20ac24 billion. Countries have to reach recycling rates of at least 50%, while the lead countries were around 65% and the EU average was 39% as of 2013.\nThe EU average has been rising steadily, to 45% in 2015.\nIn 2018, changes in the recycling market have sparked a global \"crisis\" in the industry. On 31 December 2017, China announced its \"National Sword\" policy, setting new standards for imports of recyclable material and banning materials that were deemed too \"dirty\" or \"hazardous\". The new policy caused drastic disruptions in the global market in recycling and reduced the prices of scrap plastic and low-grade paper. Exports of recyclable materials from G7 countries to China dropped dramatically, with many exports shifting to countries in southeast Asia. The crisis generated significant concern about the practices and environmental sustainability of the recycling industry. The abrupt shift caused countries to accept more recyclable materials than they could process, raising fundamental questions about shipping recycling waste from economically developed countries to countries with few environmental regulations\u2014a practice that predated the crisis.\nFor a recycling program to work, having a large, stable  of recyclable material is crucial. Three legislative options have been used to create such a supply: mandatory recycling collection, , and refuse bans. Mandatory collection laws set recycling targets for cities to aim for, usually in the form that a certain percentage of a material must be diverted from the city's waste stream by a target date. The city is then responsible for working to meet this target.\nContainer deposit legislation involves offering a refund for the return of certain containers, typically glass, plastic, and metal. When a product in such a container is purchased, a small surcharge is added to the price. This surcharge can be reclaimed by the consumer if the container is returned to a collection point. These programs have been very successful, often resulting in an 80 percent recycling rate. Despite such good results, the shift in collection costs from local government to industry and consumers has created strong opposition to the creation of such programs in some areas. A variation on this is where the manufacturer bears responsibility for the recycling of their goods. In the European Union, the WEEE Directive requires producers of consumer electronics to reimburse the recyclers' costs.\nAn alternative way to increase the supply of recyclates is to  the disposal of certain materials as waste, often including used oil, old batteries, tires, and garden waste. One aim of this method is to create a viable economy for proper disposal of banned products. Care must be taken that enough of these recycling  exist, or such bans simply lead to increased .\nLegislation has also been used to increase and maintain a demand for recycled materials. Four methods of such legislation exist: minimum recycled content mandates, utilization rates,  policies, and recycled .\nBoth minimum recycled content mandates and utilization rates increase demand directly by forcing manufacturers to include recycling in their operations. Content mandates specify that a certain percentage of a new product must consist of recycled material. Utilization rates are a more flexible option: industries are permitted to meet the recycling targets at any point of their operation or even contract recycling out in exchange for tradeable credits. Opponents to both of these methods point to the large increase in reporting requirements they impose, and claim that they rob the industry of necessary flexibility.\n have used their own  to increase recycling demand through what are called \"procurement policies\". These policies are either \"set-asides\", which reserve a certain amount of spending solely towards recycled products, or \"price preference\" programs which provide a larger  when recycled items are purchased. Additional regulations can target specific cases: in the United States, for example, the  mandates the purchase of oil, paper, tires and building insulation from recycled or re-refined sources whenever possible.\nThe final government regulation towards increased demand is recycled product labeling. When producers are required to label their packaging with amount of recycled material in the product (including the packaging), consumers are better able to make educated choices. Consumers with sufficient  can then choose more environmentally conscious options, prompt producers to increase the amount of recycled material in their products, and indirectly increase demand. Standardized recycling labeling can also have a positive effect on supply of recyclates if the labeling includes information on how and where the product can be recycled.\n\"Recyclate\" is a raw material that is sent to, and processed in a waste recycling plant or materials recovery facility which will be used to form new products. The material is collected in various methods and delivered to a facility where it undergoes re-manufacturing so that it can be used in the production of new materials or products. For example,  that are collected can be re-used and made into plastic pellets, a new product.\nThe quality of recyclates is recognized as one of the principal challenges that needs to be addressed for the success of a long-term vision of a green economy and achieving zero waste. Recyclate quality is generally referring to how much of the raw material is made up of target material compared to the amount of non-target material and other non-recyclable material. For example, steel and metal are materials with a higher recyclate quality. It's estimated that two-thirds of all new steel manufactured comes from recycled steel. Only target material is likely to be recycled, so a higher amount of non-target and non-recyclable material will reduce the quantity of recycling product. A high proportion of non-target and non-recyclable material can make it more difficult for re-processors to achieve \"high-quality\" recycling. If the recyclate is of poor quality, it is more likely to end up being down-cycled or, in more extreme cases, sent to other recovery options or landfilled. For example, to facilitate the re-manufacturing of clear glass products there are tight restrictions for colored glass going into the re-melt process. Another example is the downcycling of plastic, in which products such as plastic food packaging are often downcycled into lower quality products, and do not get recycled into the same plastic food packaging.\nThe quality of recyclate not only supports high-quality recycling, but it can also deliver significant environmental benefits by reducing, reusing and keeping products out of landfills. High-quality recycling can help support growth in the economy by maximizing the economic value of the waste material collected. Higher income levels from the sale of quality recyclates can return value which can be significant to local governments, households, and businesses. Pursuing high-quality recycling can also provide consumer and business confidence in the waste and resource management sector and may encourage investment in that sector.\nThere are many actions along the recycling supply chain that can influence and affect the material quality of recyclate. It begins with the waste producers who place non-target and non-recyclable wastes in recycling collection. This can affect the quality of final recyclate streams or require further efforts to discard those materials at later stages in the recycling process. The different collection systems can result in different levels of contamination. Depending on which materials are collected together, extra effort is required to sort this material back into separate streams and can significantly reduce the quality of the final product. Transportation and the compaction of materials can make it more difficult to separate material back into separate waste streams. Sorting facilities are not one hundred per cent effective in separating materials, despite improvements in technology and quality recyclate which can see a loss in recyclate quality. The storage of materials outside, where the product can become wet, can cause problems for re-processors. Reprocessing facilities may require further sorting steps to further reduce the amount of non-target and non-recyclable material. Each action along the recycling path plays a part in the quality of recyclate.\nThe Recyclate Quality Action Plan of Scotland sets out a number of proposed actions that the  would like to take forward in order to drive up the quality of the materials being collected for recycling and sorted at materials recovery facilities before being exported or sold on to the reprocessing market.\nThe plan's objectives are to:\nThe plan focuses on three key areas, with fourteen actions which were identified to increase the quality of materials collected, sorted and presented to the processing market in Scotland.\nThe three areas of focus are:\nA number of different systems have been implemented to collect recyclates from the general waste stream. These systems lie along the spectrum of trade-off between public convenience and government ease and expense. The three main categories of collection are \"drop-off centers\", \"buy-back centers\", and \"curbside collection\".\nCurbside collection encompasses many subtly different systems, which differ mostly on where in the process the recyclates are sorted and cleaned. The main categories are mixed waste collection, commingled recyclables, and source separation. A  generally picks up the waste.\nAt one end of the spectrum is mixed waste collection, in which all recyclates are collected mixed in with the rest of the waste, and the desired material is then sorted out and cleaned at a central sorting facility. This results in a large amount of recyclable waste, paper especially, being too soiled to reprocess, but has advantages as well: the city need not pay for a separate collection of recyclates and no public education is needed. Any changes to which materials are recyclable is easy to accommodate as all sorting happens in a central location.\nIn a commingled or , all recyclables for collection are mixed but kept separate from other waste. This greatly reduces the need for post-collection cleaning but does require  on what materials are recyclable.\nSource separation is the other extreme, where each material is cleaned and sorted prior to collection. This method requires the least post-collection sorting and produces the purest recyclates, but incurs additional  for collection of each separate material. An extensive public education program is also required, which must be successful if recyclate  is to be avoided. In , USA, its environmental authority Oregon DEQ surveyed multi-family property managers and about half of them reported problems including contamination of recyclables due to trespassers such as  gaining access to the collection areas.\nSource separation used to be the preferred method due to the high sorting costs incurred by commingled (mixed waste) collection. However, advances in sorting technology have lowered this overhead substantially. Many areas which had developed source separation programs have since switched to what is called .\nBuy-back centers differ in that the cleaned recyclates are purchased, thus providing a clear incentive for use and creating a stable supply. The post-processed material can then be sold. If this is profitable, this conserves the emission of greenhouse gases; if unprofitable, it increases the emission of greenhouse gasses. Government subsidies are necessary to make buy-back centres a viable enterprise. In 1993, according to the U.S. , it costs on average $50 to process a ton of material, which can be resold for $30.\nIn the US, the value per ton of mixed recyclables was $180 in 2011, $80 in 2015, and $100 in 2017.\nIn 2017, glass is essentially valueless, because of the low cost of sand, its major component; low oil costs thwarts plastic recycling.\nIn 2017,  was reimbursed about 20% of its costs in recycling.\nDrop-off centers require the waste producer to carry the recyclates to a central location, either an installed or mobile collection station or the reprocessing plant itself. They are the easiest type of collection to establish but suffer from low and unpredictable throughput.\nFor some waste materials such as plastic, recent technical devices called  enable a form of distributed recycling. Preliminary  (LCA) indicates that such distributed recycling of  to make filament of  in rural regions is energetically favorable to either using virgin resin or conventional recycling processes because of reductions in transportation energy.\nOnce commingled recyclates are collected and delivered to a , the different types of materials must be sorted. This is done in a series of stages, many of which involve automated processes such that a truckload of material can be fully sorted in less than an hour. Some plants can now sort the materials automatically, known as . Automatic sorting may be aided by robotics and machine-learning. In plants, a variety of materials is sorted such as paper, different types of plastics, glass, metals, food scraps, and most types of batteries. A 30 percent increase in recycling rates has been seen in the areas where these plants exist. In the United States, there are over 300 materials recovery facilities.\nInitially, the commingled recyclates are removed from the collection vehicle and placed on a conveyor belt spread out in a single layer. Large pieces of  and  are removed by hand at this stage, as they can cause later machinery to jam.\nNext, automated machinery such as disk screens and air classifiers separate the recyclates by weight, splitting lighter paper and plastic from heavier glass and metal. Cardboard is removed from the mixed paper and the most common types of plastic,  (#1) and  (#2), are collected. This separation is usually done by hand but has become automated in some sorting centers: a  scanner is used to differentiate between different types of paper and plastic based on the absorbed wavelengths, and subsequently divert each material into the proper collection channel.\nStrong magnets are used to separate out , such as iron, steel, and .  are ejected by magnetic  in which a rotating   an electric current around the aluminum cans, which in turn creates a magnetic eddy current inside the cans. This magnetic  is repulsed by a large magnetic field, and the cans are ejected from the rest of the recyclate stream.\nFinally, glass is sorted according to its color: brown, amber, green, or clear. It may either be sorted by hand, or via an automated machine that uses colored filters to detect different colors. Glass fragments smaller than 10 millimetres (0.39\u00a0in) across cannot be sorted automatically, and are mixed together as \"glass fines\".\nThis process of recycling as well as reusing the recycled material has proven advantageous because it reduces amount of waste sent to landfills, conserves natural resources, saves energy, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and helps create new jobs. Recycled materials can also be converted into new products that can be consumed again, such as paper, plastic, and glass.\nThe City and County of San Francisco's Department of the Environment is attempting to achieve a citywide goal of generating zero waste by 2020. San Francisco's refuse hauler, , operates an effective recyclables sorting facility which helped the city reach a record-breaking diversion rate of 80%.\nAlthough many government programs are concentrated on recycling at home, 64% of waste in the United Kingdom is generated by industry. The focus of many recycling programs done by industry is the cost\u2013effectiveness of recycling. The ubiquitous nature of cardboard packaging makes cardboard a commonly recycled waste product by companies that deal heavily in packaged goods, like , , and distributors of goods. Other industries deal in niche or specialized products, depending on the nature of the waste materials that are present.\nThe glass, lumber,  and paper manufacturers all deal directly in commonly recycled materials; however, old  may be collected and recycled by independent tire dealers for a profit.\nLevels of metals recycling are generally low. In 2010, the , hosted by the  (UNEP) published reports on metal stocks that exist within society and their recycling rates. The Panel reported that the increase in the use of metals during the 20th and into the 21st century has led to a substantial shift in metal stocks from below ground to use in applications within society above ground. For example, the in-use stock of copper in the USA grew from 73 to 238\u00a0kg per capita between 1932 and 1999.\nThe report authors observed that, as metals are inherently recyclable, the metal stocks in society can serve as huge mines above ground (the term \"urban mining\" has been coined with this idea in mind). However, they found that the recycling rates of many metals are very low. The report warned that the recycling rates of some  used in applications such as mobile phones, battery packs for hybrid cars and fuel cells, are so low that unless future end-of-life recycling rates are dramatically stepped up these critical metals will become unavailable for use in modern technology.\nThe military recycles some metals. The 's Ship Disposal Program uses  to reclaim the steel of old vessels. Ships may also be sunk to create an .  is a very dense metal that has qualities superior to lead and  for many military and industrial uses. The  left over from processing it into  and fuel for  is called , and is used by all branches of the U.S. military for the development of such things as armour-piercing shells and shielding.\nThe construction industry may recycle concrete and old road surface pavement, selling their waste materials for profit.\nSome industries, like the  and  technology, in particular, are being proactive in setting up recycling policies even before there is considerable volume to their waste streams, anticipating future demand during their rapid growth.\nRecycling of plastics is more difficult, as most programs are not able to reach the necessary level of quality. Recycling of  often results in  of the material, which means only products of lower quality standard can be made with the recycled material. A new approach which allows an equal level of quality is the  process. It was used after the  to fulfill the PVC Policy.\n is a growing problem, accounting for 20\u201350 million metric tons of global waste per year according to the . It is also the fastest growing waste stream in the EU. Many recyclers do not recycle e-waste responsibly. After the cargo barge  dumped 14,000 metric tons of toxic ash in , the  was formed to stem the flow of hazardous substances into poorer countries. They created the  certification to ensure that recyclers are held to the highest standards for environmental responsibility and to help consumers identify responsible recyclers. This works alongside other prominent legislation, such as the  of the EU the  National Computer Recycling Act, to prevent poisonous chemicals from entering waterways and the atmosphere.\nIn the recycling process, television sets, monitors, cell phones, and computers are typically tested for reuse and repaired. If broken, they may be disassembled for parts still having high value if labor is cheap enough. Other e-waste is shredded to pieces roughly 10 centimetres (3.9\u00a0in) in size, and manually checked to separate out toxic batteries and  which contain poisonous metals. The remaining pieces are further shredded to 10 millimetres (0.39\u00a0in) particles and passed under a magnet to remove ferrous metals. An  ejects non-ferrous metals, which are sorted by density either by a centrifuge or vibrating plates. Precious metals can be dissolved in acid, sorted, and smelted into ingots. The remaining glass and plastic fractions are separated by density and sold to re-processors. Television sets and monitors must be manually disassembled to remove lead from CRTs or the mercury backlight from LCDs.\nPlastic recycling is the process of recovering scrap or waste plastic and reprocessing the material into useful products, sometimes completely different in form from their original state. For instance, this could mean melting down soft drink bottles and then casting them as plastic chairs and tables. For some types of plastic, the same piece of plastic can only be recycled about 2\u20133 times before its quality decreases to the point where it can no longer be used.\nSome plastics are remelted to form new plastic objects; for example, PET water bottles can be converted into polyester destined for clothing. A disadvantage of this type of recycling is that the molecular weight of the polymer can change further and the levels of unwanted substances in the plastic can increase with each remelt.\nA commercial-built recycling facility is scheduled to be sent to the  in late 2019.  The facility will take in plastic waste and unneeded plastic parts and physically convert them into spools of feedstock for the space station  facility used for in-space .\nFor some polymers, it is possible to convert them back into monomers, for example, PET can be treated with an alcohol and a catalyst to form a dialkyl terephthalate. The terephthalate diester can be used with ethylene glycol to form a new polyester polymer, thus making it possible to use the pure polymer again. In 2019,  announced initiatives of  and  designed to handle a greater variety of used material.\nAnother process involves the conversion of assorted polymers into petroleum by a much less precise thermal  process. Such a process would be able to accept almost any polymer or mix of polymers, including  materials such as vulcanized rubber tires and the  in feathers and other agricultural waste. Like natural petroleum, the chemicals produced can be used as fuels or as feedstock. A RESEM Technology plant of this type in , US, uses turkey waste as input material. Gasification is a similar process but is not technically recycling since polymers are not likely to become the result.\nPlastic Pyrolysis can convert petroleum based waste streams such as plastics into quality fuels, carbons. Given below is the list of suitable plastic raw materials for :\nThe (ideal) recycling process can be differentiated into three loops, one for manufacture (production-waste recycling) and two for disposal of the product (product and material recycling).\nThe product's manufacturing phase, which consists of material processing and fabrication, forms the  loop. Industrial waste materials are fed back into, and reused in, the same production process.\nThe product's disposal process requires two recycling loops:  and .\nThe product or product parts are reused in the  phase. This happens in one of two ways: the product is used retaining the product functionality (\"reuse\") or the product continues to be used but with altered functionality (\"further use\"). The product design is unmodified, or only slightly modified, in both scenarios.\nProduct disassembly requires  where product materials are recovered and recycled. Ideally, the materials are processed so they can flow back into the production process.\nIn order to meet recyclers' needs while providing manufacturers a consistent, uniform system, a  was developed. The recycling code for plastics was introduced in 1988 by the plastics industry through the . Because municipal recycling programs traditionally have targeted packaging\u2014primarily bottles and containers\u2014the  offered a means of identifying the resin content of bottles and containers commonly found in the residential waste stream.\nPlastic products are printed with numbers 1\u20137 depending on the type of resin. Type 1 () is commonly found in  and . Type 2 () is found in most hard plastics such as , laundry detergent bottles, and some dishware. Type 3 () includes items such as shampoo bottles, shower curtains, , , wire jacketing, medical equipment, siding, and piping. Type 4 () is found in shopping bags, squeezable bottles, tote bags, clothing, furniture, and carpet. Type 5 is  and makes up syrup bottles, straws, , and some automotive parts. Type 6 is  and makes up meat trays, egg cartons, clamshell containers, and compact disc cases. Type 7 includes all other plastics such as bulletproof materials, 3- and 5-gallon water bottles, cell phone and tablet frames, safety goggles and sunglasses. Having a recycling code or the chasing arrows logo on a material is not an automatic indicator that a material is recyclable but rather an explanation of what the material is. Types 1 and 2 are the most commonly recycled.\nThere is some debate over whether recycling is . According to a  study, waste collection and landfill disposal creates less than one job per 1,000 tons of waste material managed; in contrast, the collection, processing, and manufacturing of recycled materials creates 6\u201313 or more jobs per 1,000 tons. However, the cost effectiveness of creating the additional jobs remains unproven. According to the U.S. Recycling Economic Informational Study, there are over 50,000 recycling establishments that have created over a million jobs in the US.\nTwo years after New York City declared that implementing recycling programs would be \"a drain on the city\", New York City leaders realized that an efficient recycling system could save the city over $20 million. Municipalities often see  benefits from implementing recycling programs, largely due to the reduced  costs. A study conducted by the  according to the Economist found that in 83 percent of cases, recycling is the most efficient method to dispose of household waste. However, a 2004 assessment by the Danish Environmental Assessment Institute concluded that incineration was the most effective method for disposing of drink containers, even aluminium ones.\nFiscal efficiency is separate from economic efficiency. Economic analysis of recycling does not include what economists call , which are unpriced costs and benefits that accrue to individuals outside of private transactions. Examples include: decreased air pollution and greenhouse gases from incineration, reduced  leaching from landfills, reduced  consumption, and reduced waste and , which leads to a reduction in environmentally damaging mining and timber activity. About 4,000 minerals are known, of which only a few hundred are relatively common. Known reserves of  will be exhausted within the next 100 years at current rates of usage. Without mechanisms such as taxes or subsidies to internalize externalities, businesses may ignore them despite the costs imposed on society. To make such nonfiscal benefits economically relevant, advocates have pushed for legislative action to increase the demand for recycled materials. The  (EPA) has concluded in favor of recycling, saying that recycling efforts reduced the country's  by a net 49 million  in 2005. In the United Kingdom, the  stated that Great Britain's recycling efforts reduce  by 10\u201315 million tonnes a year. Recycling is more efficient in densely populated areas, as there are  involved.\nCertain requirements must be met for recycling to be economically feasible and environmentally effective. These include an adequate source of recyclates, a system to extract those recyclates from the , a nearby factory capable of reprocessing the recyclates, and a potential demand for the recycled products. These last two requirements are often overlooked\u2014without both an industrial market for production using the collected materials and a consumer market for the manufactured goods, recycling is incomplete and in fact only \"collection\".\nFree-market economist  remarked \"There are three ways society can organize waste disposal: (a) commanding, (b) guiding by tax and subsidy, and (c) leaving it to the individual and the market\". These principles appear to divide economic thinkers today.\n favours a high level of government intervention to provide recycling services. He believes that recycling's benefit cannot be effectively quantified by traditional  economics.  supports intervention, saying that it is a public service equal to education and policing. He argues that manufacturers should shoulder more of the burden of waste disposal.\nPaul Calcott and Margaret Walls advocate the second option. A deposit refund scheme and a small refuse charge would encourage recycling but not at the expense of fly-tipping. Thomas C. Kinnaman concludes that a landfill tax would force consumers, companies and councils to recycle more.\nMost free-market thinkers detest subsidy and intervention because they waste resources.  and Donald Leal think that all recycling programmes should be privately operated, and therefore would only operate if the money saved by recycling exceeds its costs.  argues that it wastes people's resources and lowers the wealth of a population.\nThe  (NWRA) then again reported in May 2015, that recycling and waste made a $6.7 billion economic impact in Ohio, U.S., and employed 14,000 people.\nCertain countries trade in unprocessed . Some have complained that the ultimate fate of recyclates sold to another country is unknown and they may end up in landfills instead of being reprocessed. According to one report, in America, 50\u201380 percent of computers destined for recycling are actually not recycled. There are reports of illegal-waste imports to China being dismantled and recycled solely for monetary gain, without consideration for workers' health or environmental damage. Although the Chinese government has banned these practices, it has not been able to eradicate them. In 2008, the prices of recyclable waste plummeted before rebounding in 2009. Cardboard averaged about \u00a353/tonne from 2004 to 2008, dropped to \u00a319/tonne, and then went up to \u00a359/tonne in May 2009. PET plastic averaged about \u00a3156/tonne, dropped to \u00a375/tonne and then moved up to \u00a3195/tonne in May 2009.\nCertain regions have difficulty using or exporting as much of a material as they recycle. This problem is most prevalent with glass: both Britain and the U.S. import large quantities of wine bottled in green glass. Though much of this glass is sent to be recycled, outside the  there is not enough wine production to use all of the reprocessed material. The extra must be downcycled into building materials or re-inserted into the regular waste stream.\nSimilarly, the northwestern United States has difficulty finding markets for recycled newspaper, given the large number of  in the region as well as the proximity to Asian markets. In other areas of the U.S., however, demand for used newsprint has seen wide fluctuation.\nIn some U.S. states, a program called  pays people to recycle, receiving money from local municipalities for the reduction in landfill space which must be purchased. It uses a single stream process in which all material is automatically sorted.\n\nCritics dispute the net economic and environmental benefits of recycling over its costs, and suggest that proponents of recycling often make matters worse and suffer from . Specifically, critics argue that the costs and energy used in collection and transportation detract from (and outweigh) the costs and energy saved in the production process; also that the jobs produced by the recycling industry can be a poor trade for the jobs lost in logging, mining, and other industries associated with production; and that materials such as paper pulp can only be recycled a few times before material degradation prevents further recycling.\nMuch of the difficulty inherent in recycling comes from the fact that most products are not designed with recycling in mind. The concept of  aims to solve this problem, and was laid out in the book  by architect  and chemist . They suggest that every product (and all packaging it requires) should have a complete \"closed-loop\" cycle mapped out for each component\u2014a way in which every component will either return to the natural ecosystem through  or be recycled indefinitely.\nComplete recycling is impossible from a practical standpoint. In summary, substitution and recycling strategies only delay the depletion of non-renewable stocks and therefore may buy time in the transition to true or strong , which ultimately is only guaranteed in an economy based on renewable resources.While recycling diverts waste from entering directly into landfill sites, current recycling misses the dispersive components. These critics believe that complete recycling is impracticable as highly dispersed wastes become so diluted that the energy needed for their recovery becomes increasingly excessive. \nAs with , care must be taken to ensure a complete view of the costs and benefits involved. For example,  packaging for food products is more easily recycled than most plastic, but is heavier to ship and may result in more waste from spoilage.\n\nThe amount of energy saved through recycling depends upon the material being recycled and the type of energy accounting that is used. Correct accounting for this saved energy can be accomplished with  using real energy values, and in addition, , which is a measure of how much useful energy can be used. In general, it takes far less energy to produce a unit mass of recycled materials than it does to make the same mass of virgin materials.\nSome scholars use  (spelled with an m) analysis, for example, budgets for the amount of energy of one kind (exergy) that is required to make or transform things into another kind of product or service. Emergy calculations take into account economics which can alter pure physics-based results. Using emergy life-cycle analysis researchers have concluded that materials with large refining costs have the greatest potential for high recycle benefits. Moreover, the highest emergy efficiency accrues from systems geared toward material recycling, where materials are engineered to recycle back into their original form and purpose, followed by  systems where the materials are recycled into a different kind of product, and then by-product reuse systems where parts of the products are used to make an entirely different product.\nThe  (EIA) states on its website that \"a paper mill uses 40 percent less energy to make paper from recycled paper than it does to make paper from fresh lumber.\" Some critics argue that it takes more energy to produce recycled products than it does to dispose of them in traditional landfill methods, since the curbside collection of recyclables often requires a second waste truck. However, recycling proponents point out that a second timber or logging truck is eliminated when paper is collected for recycling, so the net energy consumption is the same. An emergy life-cycle analysis on recycling revealed that fly ash, aluminum, recycled concrete aggregate, recycled plastic, and steel yield higher efficiency ratios, whereas the recycling of lumber generates the lowest recycle benefit ratio. Hence, the specific nature of the recycling process, the methods used to analyse the process, and the products involved affect the energy savings budgets.\nIt is difficult to determine the amount of energy consumed or produced in waste disposal processes in broader ecological terms, where causal relations dissipate into complex networks of material and energy flow. For example, \"cities do not follow all the strategies of ecosystem development. Biogeochemical paths become fairly straight relative to wild ecosystems, with very reduced recycling, resulting in large flows of waste and low total energy efficiencies. By contrast, in wild ecosystems, one population's wastes are another population's resources, and succession results in efficient exploitation of available resources. However, even modernized cities may still be in the earliest stages of a succession that may take centuries or millennia to complete.\" How much energy is used in recycling also depends on the type of material being recycled and the process used to do so. Aluminium is generally agreed to use far less energy when recycled rather than being produced from scratch. The EPA states that \"recycling aluminum cans, for example, saves 95 percent of the energy required to make the same amount of aluminum from its virgin source, .\" In 2009, more than half of all aluminium cans produced came from recycled aluminium. Similarly, it has been estimated that new steel produced with recycled cans reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 75%.\nEvery year, millions of tons of materials are being exploited from the earth's crust, and processed into consumer and capital goods. After decades to centuries, most of these materials are \"lost\". With the exception of some pieces of art or religious relics, they are no longer engaged in the consumption process. Where are they? Recycling is only an intermediate solution for such materials, although it does prolong the residence time in the anthroposphere. For thermodynamic reasons, however, recycling cannot prevent the final need for an ultimate sink.Economist  has suggested that the sole benefit of reducing landfill space is trumped by the energy needed and resulting pollution from the recycling process. Others, however, have calculated through life-cycle assessment that producing recycled paper uses less energy and water than harvesting, pulping, processing, and transporting virgin trees. When less recycled paper is used, additional energy is needed to create and maintain farmed forests until these forests are as self-sustainable as virgin forests.\nOther studies have shown that recycling in itself is inefficient to perform the \"decoupling\" of economic development from the depletion of non-renewable raw materials that is necessary for sustainable development. The international transportation or recycle material flows through \"...\u00a0different trade networks of the three countries result in different flows, decay rates, and potential recycling returns\". As global consumption of a natural resources grows, their depletion is inevitable. The best recycling can do is to delay; complete closure of material loops to achieve 100 percent recycling of nonrenewables is impossible as micro-trace materials dissipate into the environment causing severe damage to the planet's ecosystems. Historically, this was identified as the metabolic rift by , who identified the unequal exchange rate between energy and nutrients flowing from rural areas to feed urban cities that create effluent wastes degrading the planet's ecological capital, such as loss in soil nutrient production. Energy conservation also leads to what is known as , where improvements in energy efficiency lowers the cost of production and leads to a rebound effect where rates of consumption and economic growth increases.\n\nThe amount of money actually saved through recycling depends on the efficiency of the recycling program used to do it. The  argues that the cost of recycling depends on various factors, such as  and the amount of disposal that the community recycles. It states that communities begin to save money when they treat recycling as a replacement for their traditional waste system rather than an add-on to it and by \"redesigning their collection schedules and/or trucks\".\nIn some cases, the cost of recyclable materials also exceeds the cost of raw materials. Virgin plastic resin costs 40 percent less than recycled resin. Additionally, a  (EPA) study that tracked the price of clear glass from 15 July to 2 August 1991, found that the average cost per ton ranged from $40 to $60 while a  report shows that the cost per ton of raw silica sand from years 1993 to 1997 fell between $17.33 and $18.10.\nComparing the market cost of recyclable material with the cost of new raw materials ignores economic \u2014the costs that are currently not counted by the market. Creating a new piece of plastic, for instance, may cause more pollution and be less sustainable than recycling a similar piece of plastic, but these factors will not be counted in market cost. A  can be used to determine the levels of externalities and decide whether the recycling may be worthwhile despite unfavorable market costs. Alternatively, legal means (such as a ) can be used to bring externalities into the market, so that the market cost of the material becomes close to the true cost.\nThe recycling of waste electrical and electronic equipment can create a significant amount of pollution. This problem is specifically occurrent in India and China. Informal recycling in an underground economy of these countries has generated an environmental and health disaster. High levels of lead (Pb), polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs),  and , as well as polybrominated dioxins and furans (PCDD/Fs and PBDD/Fs), concentrated in the air, , dust, soil, water, and sediments in areas surrounding recycling sites. These materials can make work sites harmful to the workers themselves and the surrounding environment. \n\nEconomist , author of a paper entitled \"Why I Am Not an Environmentalist\", claimed that  actually reduces tree populations. He argues that because paper companies have incentives to replenish their forests, large demands for paper lead to large forests while reduced demand for paper leads to fewer \"farmed\" forests.\nWhen foresting companies cut down trees, more are planted in their place; however, such \"farmed\" forests are inferior to natural forests in several ways. Farmed forests are not able to fix the soil as quickly as natural forests. This can cause widespread  and often requiring large amounts of  to maintain the soil, while containing little tree and wild-life  compared to virgin forests. Also, the new trees planted are not as big as the trees that were cut down, and the argument that there will be \"more trees\" is not compelling to forestry advocates when they are counting saplings.\nIn particular, wood from tropical rainforests is rarely harvested for paper because of their heterogeneity. According to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change secretariat, the overwhelming direct cause of deforestation is  (48% of deforestation) and  (32%), which is linked to food, not paper production.\nThe reduction of greenhouse gas emission reduction also benefits from the development of the recycling industry. In , the only green growth model city in Asia selected by OECD, recycling industries are strongly promoted and financially supported as part of the  in Japan. Given the industrial sector in Kitakyushu accounts for more than 60% energy consumption of the city, the development of recycling industry results in substantial energy reduction due to the economies of scale effects; the concentration of CO is, thus, found to decline accordingly.\nOther non-conventional methods of material recycling, like Waste-to-Energy (WTE) systems, have garnered increased attention in the recent past due to the polarizing nature of their emissions. While viewed as a sustainable method of capturing energy from material waste feedstocks by many, others have cited numerous explanations for why the technology has not been scaled globally.\nIn some countries, recycling is performed by the entrepreneurial poor such as the , , the , , and . With the creation of large recycling organizations that may be profitable, either by law or , the poor are more likely to be driven out of the recycling and the  job market. To compensate for this loss of income, a society may need to create additional forms of societal programs to help support the poor. Like the , there is a net loss to the poor and possibly the whole of a society to make recycling artificially profitable, e.g. through the law. However, in Brazil and Argentina, waste pickers/informal recyclers work alongside the authorities, in fully or semi-funded cooperatives, allowing informal recycling to be legitimized as a paid public sector job.\nBecause the social support of a country is likely to be less than the loss of income to the poor undertaking recycling, there is a greater chance the poor will come in conflict with the large recycling organizations. This means fewer people can decide if certain waste is more economically reusable in its current form rather than being reprocessed. Contrasted to the recycling poor, the efficiency of their recycling may actually be higher for some materials because individuals have greater control over what is considered \"waste\".\nOne labor-intensive underused waste is electronic and computer waste. Because this waste may still be functional and wanted mostly by those on lower incomes, who may sell or use it at a greater efficiency than large recyclers.\nSome recycling advocates believe that  individual-based recycling does not cover all of society's recycling needs. Thus, it does not negate the need for an organized recycling program. Local government can consider the activities of the recycling poor as contributing to the ruining of property.\nChanges that have been demonstrated to increase recycling rates include:\n\"Between 1960 and 2000, the world production of plastic resins increased 25 times its original amount, while recovery of the material remained below 5 percent.\" Many studies have addressed recycling behaviour and strategies to encourage community involvement in recycling programs. It has been argued that recycling behavior is not natural because it requires a focus and appreciation for long-term planning, whereas humans have evolved to be sensitive to short-term survival goals; and that to overcome this innate predisposition, the best solution would be to use social pressure to compel participation in recycling programs. However, recent studies have concluded that social pressure will not work in this context. One reason for this is that social pressure functions well in small group sizes of 50 to 150 individuals (common to nomadic hunter\u2013gatherer peoples) but not in communities numbering in the millions, as we see today. Another reason is that individual recycling does not take place in the public view.\nFollowing the increasing popularity of recycling collection being sent to the same landfills as trash, some people kept on putting recyclables on the recyclables bin. In Baltimore, the government kept collecting glass separately for seven years even though it did not recycle it.\nArt objects are more and more often made from recycled material.\nIn a study done by social psychologist Shawn Burn, it was found that personal contact with individuals within a neighborhood is the most effective way to increase recycling within a community. In his study, he had 10 block leaders talk to their neighbors and persuade them to recycle. A comparison group was sent fliers promoting recycling. It was found that the neighbors that were personally contacted by their block leaders recycled much more than the group without personal contact. As a result of this study, Shawn Burn believes that personal contact within a small group of people is an important factor in encouraging recycling. Another study done by Stuart Oskamp examines the effect of neighbors and friends on recycling. It was found in his studies that people who had friends and neighbors that recycled were much more likely to also recycle than those who didn't have friends and neighbors that recycled.\nMany schools have created recycling awareness clubs in order to give young students an insight on recycling. These schools believe that the clubs actually encourage students to not only recycle at school but at home as well.\n"},

Waste management deals with all types of waste, including industrial, biological and household. In some cases, waste can pose a threat to human health. Waste is produced by human activity, for example, the extraction and processing of raw materials. Waste management is intended to reduce adverse effects of waste on human , the  or .\nWaste management practices are not uniform among countries ( and ); regions ( and ), and  and  sectors can all take different approaches.\nA large portion of waste management practices deal with  (MSW) which is the bulk of the waste that is created by household, industrial, and commercial activity.\nThe  refers to the \"3 Rs\" ,  and , which classifies waste management strategies according to their desirability in terms of . The waste hierarchy is the cornerstone of most waste minimisation strategies. The aim of the waste hierarchy is to extract the maximum practical benefits from products and to generate the minimum amount of end waste; see: . The waste hierarchy is represented as a pyramid because the basic premise is that policies should promote measures to prevent the generation of waste. The next step or preferred action is to seek alternative uses for the waste that has been generated i.e. by re-use. The next is recycling which includes composting. Following this step is material recovery and . The final action is disposal, in landfills or through incineration without . This last step is the final resort for waste which has not been prevented, diverted or recovered. The waste hierarchy represents the progression of a product or material through the sequential stages of the pyramid of waste management. The hierarchy represents the latter parts of the life-cycle for each product.\nThe life-cycle begins with design, then proceeds through manufacture, distribution, and primary use and then follows through the waste hierarchy's stages of reduce, reuse and recycle.  Each stage in the life-cycle offers opportunities for policy intervention, to rethink the need for the product, to redesign to minimize waste potential, to extend its use. Product life-cycle analysis is a way to optimize the use of the world's limited resources by avoiding the unnecessary generation of waste.\n reflects the understanding that global economic growth and development can not be sustained at current production and consumption patterns. Globally, humanity extracts more resources to produce goods than the planet can replenish. Resource efficiency is the reduction of the environmental impact from the production and consumption of these goods, from final raw material extraction to the last use and disposal.\nThe  mandates that the polluting party pays for the impact on the environment. With respect to waste management, this generally refers to the requirement for a waste generator to pay for appropriate disposal of the unrecoverable material.\nThroughout most of history, the amount of  generated by humans was insignificant due to low levels of  and  Common waste produced during pre-modern times was mainly ashes and human , and these were released back into the ground locally, with minimum . Tools made out of  or  were generally reused or passed down through the generations.\nHowever, some civilizations do seem to have been more profligate in their waste output than others. In particular, the  of  had a fixed monthly ritual, in which the people of the village would gather together and burn their rubbish in large dumps.\nFollowing the onset of  and the sustained urban growth of large population centres in , the buildup of waste in the cities caused a rapid deterioration in levels of  and the general quality of urban life. The streets became choked with filth due to the lack of waste clearance regulations. Calls for the establishment of a municipal authority with waste removal powers occurred as early as 1751, when  in London proposed that \"... as the preservation of the health of the people is of great importance, it is proposed that the cleaning of this city, should be put under one uniform public management, and all the filth be...conveyed by the  to proper distance in the country\".\nHowever, it was not until the mid-19th century, spurred by increasingly devastating  outbreaks and the emergence of a public health debate that the first legislation on the issue emerged. Highly influential in this new focus was the report  in 1842 of the , , in which he argued for the importance of adequate waste removal and management facilities to improve the health and wellbeing of the city's population.\nIn the UK, the Nuisance Removal and Disease Prevention Act of 1846 began what was to be a steadily evolving process of the provision of regulated waste management in London. The  was the first citywide authority that centralized sanitation regulation for the rapidly expanding city and the  made it compulsory for every household to deposit their weekly waste in \"moveable receptacles\" for disposal\u2014the first concept for a dust-bin.\nThe dramatic increase in waste for disposal led to the creation of the first  plants, or, as they were then called, \"destructors\". In 1874, the first incinerator was built in  by  to the design of Alfred Fryer. However, these were met with opposition on account of the large amounts of ash they produced and which wafted over the neighbouring areas.\nSimilar municipal systems of waste disposal sprung up at the turn of the 20th century in other large cities of  and . In 1895,  became the first U.S. city with public-sector garbage management.\nEarly  were simply open bodied  pulled by a team of horses. They became motorized in the early part of the 20th century and the first closed body trucks to eliminate odours with a dumping lever mechanism were introduced in the 1920s in Britain. These were soon equipped with 'hopper mechanisms' where the scooper was loaded at floor level and then hoisted mechanically to deposit the waste in the truck. The  was the first truck in 1938, to incorporate a hydraulic compactor.\nWaste collection methods vary widely among different countries and regions. Domestic waste collection services are often provided by local government authorities, or by private companies for industrial and commercial waste. Some areas, especially those in less developed countries, do not have formal waste-collection systems.\n is the most common method of disposal in most European countries, , , , and many other parts of the developed world in which waste is collected at regular intervals by specialised trucks. This is often associated with curb-side waste segregation. In rural areas waste may need to be taken to a transfer station. Waste collected is then transported to an appropriate disposal facility.\nIn some areas, vacuum collection is used in which waste is transported from the home or commercial premises by vacuum along small bore tubes. Systems are in use in Europe and North America.\nIn some jurisdictions unsegregated waste is collected at the curb-side or from waste transfer stations and then sorted into recyclables and unusable waste. Such systems are capable of sorting large volumes of solid waste, salvaging recyclables, and turning the rest into bio-gas and soil conditioner.\nIn , the local government established its  in support of its goal of \"Zero waste by 2020\", requiring everyone in the city to keep recyclables and compostables out of the landfill. The three streams are collected with the curbside \"Fantastic 3\" bin system \u2013 blue for recyclables, green for compostables, and black for landfill-bound materials \u2013 provided to residents and businesses and serviced by San Francisco's sole refuse hauler, Recology. The City's \"Pay-As-You-Throw\" system charges customers by the volume of landfill-bound materials, which provides a financial incentive to separate recyclables and compostables from other discards. The City's Department of the Environment's Zero Waste Program has led the City to achieve 80% diversion, the highest diversion rate in North America. Other businesses such as  use a variety of colors to distinguish between trash and recycling cans.\nIn most developed countries, domestic waste disposal is funded from a national or local tax which may be related to income, or property values. Commercial and industrial waste disposal is typically charged for as a commercial service, often as an integrated charge which includes disposal costs. This practice may encourage disposal contractors to opt for the cheapest disposal option such as landfill rather than the environmentally best solution such as re-use and recycling.\nIn some areas such as , the city government charges its households and industries for the volume of rubbish they produce. Waste is collected by the city council only if it is put in government issued rubbish bags. This policy has successfully reduced the amount of waste the city produces and increased the recycling rate.\n has also seen benefits from implementing a $300 million sanitary  system. While it might appear to be a costly investment, the country's government predicts that it has saved them another $440 million in damages, or consequences of failing to dispose of waste properly.\nA landfill is a site for the disposal of  materials by burial. Landfill is the oldest form of , although the burial of the waste is modern; historically, refuse was simply left in piles or thrown into pits. Historically, landfills have been the most common method of organized  and remain so in many places around the world.\nIncineration is a disposal method in which solid organic wastes are subjected to combustion so as to convert them into residue and gaseous products. This method is useful for disposal of both municipal solid waste and solid residue from waste water treatment. This process reduces the volumes of solid waste by 80 to 95 percent. Incineration and other high temperature waste treatment systems are sometimes described as \"\". Incinerators convert waste materials into , , , and .\nIncineration is carried out both on a small scale by individuals and on a large scale by industry. It is used to dispose of solid, liquid and gaseous waste. It is recognized as a practical method of disposing of certain  materials (such as biological ). Incineration is a controversial method of waste disposal, due to issues such as emission of gaseous .\nIncineration is common in countries such as  where land is more scarce, as the facilities generally do not require as much area as landfills.  (WtE) or energy-from-waste (EfW) are broad terms for facilities that burn waste in a furnace or boiler to generate heat, steam or electricity. Combustion in an incinerator is not always perfect and there have been concerns about pollutants in gaseous emissions from incinerator stacks. Particular concern has focused on some very persistent  such as , , and , which may be created and which may have serious environmental consequences.\nRecycling is a  practice that refers to the collection and reuse of waste materials such as empty beverage containers. The materials from which the items are made can be reprocessed into new products. Material for recycling may be collected separately from general waste using dedicated bins and collection vehicles, a procedure called . In some communities, the owner of the waste is required to separate the materials into different bins (e.g. for paper, plastics, metals) prior to its collection. In other communities, all recyclable materials are placed in a single bin for collection, and the sorting is handled later at a central facility. The latter method is known as \".\"\nThe most common consumer products recycled include  such as beverage cans,  such as wire,  from food and aerosol cans, old steel furnishings or equipment, rubber ,  and  bottles,  bottles and jars,  , , magazines and light paper, and  boxes.\n, , , and  (see ) are also recyclable. These items are usually composed of a single type of material, making them relatively easy to recycle into new products. The recycling of complex products (such as computers and electronic equipment) is more difficult, due to the additional dismantling and separation required.\nThe type of  material accepted for recycling varies by city and country. Each city and country has different recycling programs in place that can handle the various types of recyclable materials.  However, certain variation in acceptance is reflected in the resale value of the material once it is reprocessed. In July 2017, the Chinese government announced an import ban of 24 categories of recyclables and solid waste, including plastic, textiles and mixed paper, placing tremendous impact on developed countries globally, which exported directly or indirectly to China.\nRecoverable materials that are organic in nature, such as , food scraps, and paper products, can be recovered through  and digestion processes to  the organic matter. The resulting organic material is then recycled as  or  for agricultural or landscaping purposes. In addition, waste gas from the process (such as methane) can be captured and used for generating electricity and heat (CHP/cogeneration) maximising efficiencies. The intention of biological processing in waste management is to control and accelerate the natural process of decomposition of organic matter. (See ).\nEnergy recovery from waste is the conversion of non-recyclable waste materials into usable heat, electricity, or fuel through a variety of processes, including combustion, gasification, pyrolyzation, anaerobic digestion, and  recovery. This process is often called waste-to-energy. Energy recovery from waste is part of the non-hazardous waste management hierarchy. Using energy recovery to convert non-recyclable waste materials into electricity and heat, generates a renewable energy source and can reduce carbon emissions by offsetting the need for energy from fossil sources as well as reduce methane generation from landfills. Globally, waste-to-energy accounts for 16% of waste management.\nThe energy content of waste products can be harnessed directly by using them as a direct combustion fuel, or indirectly by processing them into another type of fuel. Thermal treatment ranges from using waste as a fuel source for cooking or heating and the use of the gas fuel (see above), to fuel for  to generate steam and electricity in a .  and  are two related forms of thermal treatment where waste materials are heated to high temperatures with limited  availability. The process usually occurs in a sealed vessel under high . Pyrolysis of solid waste converts the material into solid, liquid and gas products. The liquid and gas can be burnt to produce energy or refined into other chemical products (chemical refinery). The solid residue (char) can be further refined into products such as . Gasification and advanced  are used to convert organic materials directly into a synthetic gas () composed of  and . The gas is then burnt to produce electricity and .\nAn alternative to pyrolysis is high temperature and pressure supercritical water decomposition (hydrothermal monophasic oxidation).\nPyrolysis is often used to convert many types of domestic and industrial residues into a recovered fuel. Different types of waste input (such as plant waste, food waste, tyres) placed in the pyrolysis process potentially yield an alternative to fossil fuels. Pyrolysis is a process of thermo-chemical decomposition of organic materials by heat in the absence of stoichiometric quantities of ; the decomposition produces various hydrocarbon gases. During pyrolysis, the molecules of object vibrate at high frequencies to an extent that molecules start breaking down. The rate of pyrolysis increases with . In industrial applications, temperatures are above 430\u00a0\u00b0C (800\u00a0\u00b0F). Slow pyrolysis produces gases and solid charcoal. Pyrolysis hold promise for conversion of  into useful liquid fuel. Pyrolysis of waste wood and plastics can potentially produce fuel. The solids left from pyrolysis contain metals, glass, sand and pyrolysis coke which does not convert to gas.  Compared to the process of incineration, certain types of pyrolysis processes release less harmful by-products that contain alkali metals, sulphur, and chlorine. However, pyrolysis of some waste yields gasses which impact the environment such as HCl and SO.\nResource recovery is the systematic diversion of waste, which was intended for disposal, for a specific next use. It is the processing of recyclables to extract or recover materials and resources, or convert to energy. These activities are performed at a resource recovery facility. Resource recovery is not only environmentally important, but it is also cost-effective. It decreases the amount of waste for disposal, saves space in landfills, and conserves natural resources.\nResource recovery (as opposed to waste management) uses LCA (life cycle analysis) attempts to offer alternatives to waste management. For mixed MSW (Municipal Solid Waste) a number of broad studies have indicated that administration, source separation and collection followed by reuse and recycling of the non-organic fraction and energy and compost/fertilizer production of the organic material via anaerobic digestion to be the favoured path.\nAs an example of how resource recycling can be beneficial, many items thrown away contain metals that can be recycled to create a profit, such as the components in circuit boards.  Wood chippings in pallets and other packaging materials can be recycled to useful products for horticulture. The recycled chips can cover paths, walkways, or arena surfaces.\nApplication of rational and consistent waste management practices can yield a range of benefits including:\nThe management of waste is a key component in a business' ability to maintain  accreditation. The standard encourages companies to improve their environmental efficiencies each year by eliminating waste through  practices. One way to do this is by adopting resource recovery practices like  materials such as glass, food scraps, paper and cardboard,  and metal.  Recycled materials can often be sold to the . Many inorganic waste streams can be used to produce materials for construction. Concrete and bricks can be recycled as artificial gravel.  This topic was on the agenda of the International WASCON conference in Spain in June 2015 and on the international Conference on Green Urbanism, held in Italy 12\u201314 October 2016.\nSewage sludge is produced by waste water treatment processes. Due to rapid urbanization, there has been an increase in municipal waste water that results 0.1\u201330.8\u00a0kg of sewage per population equivalent per year (kg/p.e/year). Common disposal practices of sewage sludge are incineration, composting, and landfill.\nAn important method of waste management is the prevention of waste material being created, also known as . Methods of avoidance include reuse of second-hand products, repairing broken items instead of buying new ones, designing products to be refillable or reusable (such as cotton instead of plastic shopping bags), encouraging consumers to avoid using  (such as disposable ), removing any food/liquid remains from cans and packaging, and designing products that use less material to achieve the same purpose (for example, lightweighting of beverage cans).\nWhile waste transport within a given country falls under national regulations,  is often subject to international treaties. A major concern to many countries in the world has been . The , ratified by 172 countries, deprecates movement of hazardous waste from developed to less developed countries. The provisions of the Basel convention have been integrated into the EU waste shipment regulation.\n, although considered hazardous, does not fall under the jurisdiction of the Basel Convention.\nAreas with developing economies often experience exhausted waste collection services and inadequately managed and uncontrolled dumpsites. The problems are worsening.  Problems with governance complicate the situation. Waste management in these countries and cities is an ongoing challenge due to weak institutions, chronic under-resourcing and rapid urbanization. All of these challenges, along with the lack of understanding of different factors that contribute to the hierarchy of waste management, affect the treatment of waste.\nTraditionally, the  has been a late adopter of new technologies such as  (Radio Frequency Identification) tags, GPS and integrated software packages which enable better quality data to be collected without the use of estimation or manual data entry.\nRelated scientific journals in this area include:\n\n"},
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuse", "title": "ReuseWikipedia", "body": " is the action or practice of using an item, whether for its original purpose (conventional reuse) or to fulfil a different function ( or ). It should be distinguished from , which is the breaking down of used items to make  for the manufacture of new products. Reuse \u2013 by taking, but not reprocessing, previously used items \u2013 helps save time, money, energy and resources. In broader economic terms, it can make quality products available to people and organizations with limited means, while generating jobs and business activity that contribute to the economy.\nHistorically, financial motivation was one of the main drivers of reuse. In the developing world this driver can lead to very high levels of reuse, however rising wages and consequent consumer demand for the convenience of  products has made the reuse of low value items such as packaging uneconomic in richer countries, leading to the demise of many reuse programs. Current environmental awareness is gradually changing attitudes and regulations, such as the new packaging regulations, are gradually beginning to reverse the situation.\nOne example  of conventional reuse is the doorstep delivery of  in glass ; other examples include the  and the use of returnable/reusable plastic boxes, , instead of single-use  boxes.\nReuse has certain potential advantages:\n\nDisadvantages are also apparent:\nThese services facilitate the transaction and redistribution of unwanted, yet perfectly usable, materials and equipment from one entity to another.

Some maintain a physical space (a reuse center), and others act as a matching service (a virtual exchange). Reuse centers generally maintain both warehouses and trucks. They take possession of the donated materials and make them available for redistribution or sale. Virtual exchanges do not have physical space or trucks, but instead allow users to post listings of materials available and wanted (for free or at low cost) on an online materials exchange website. Staff will help facilitate the exchange of these materials without ever taking possession of the materials.\nVirtual exchanges include:\nConsumer resources exist for exchanging usable materials, such as  sites which are often grassroots and entirely nonprofit movements of people who are giving (and getting) stuff for free in their own towns. It's all about reuse and keeping good stuff out of landfills. Membership is normally free. In, addition, there are directory-based resources such as RecycleChicken.com which point consumers to local and national locations for reuse and repurposing of materials not normally accepted in  programs.\nWith technological innovations, new applications and shorter product lifetimes there is an ever-increasing quantity of waste electrical and electronic equipment. The environmental pressures associated with this are well documented and include material and energy losses and an increase in air, water and land pollution from waste treatment methods. The incorrect disposal and treatment of electrical and electronic equipment also poses threats to human health, particularly when involving illegal exports.\nVirtual exchanges include:\nOne way to address this is to increase product longevity; either by extending a product's first life or addressing issues of repair, reuse and recycling. Reusing products, and therefore extending the use of that item beyond the point where it is discarded by its first user is preferable to recycling or disposal, as this is the least energy intensive solution, although it is often overlooked.\nThe EU Circular Economy Package recognises the importance of extending product lifetimes and includes repair and reuse of products in its action plan to ensure products reach their optimum lifespan. If targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions are to be reached, then reuse needs to be included as part of a whole life cycle approach.\nA strong second hand market-place exists, with charity shops on most high streets, car boot(trunk) sales and online auction sites maintaining popularity and regular TV shows featuring both buying and selling at auction.\nHowever, the reuse of electrical and electronic equipment products remains low due to inadequate infrastructure, lack of repair networks and products. Local authority collection systems are better suited for handling waste than handling goods and preserving reuse potential. Retailer delivery staff are trained to handle goods carefully.\nSo, do we need a radical rethink on how we move unwanted, still usable items to the second-hand market place? Is there a case for changing our approach to producer responsibility and insisting that producers finance collection for reuse, and additionally, drive consumer choices for reuse, repair and remanufacture; whilst addressing the costs of recycling and disposal?\nThere are opportunities for producers, waste management companies and local authorities to make both repair and reuse habitual, whilst these require changes to householder behaviour change through raising awareness, they also require investment in infrastructure and logistical operations. Is it time to insist that more products are designed to have longer lifetimes? That they can be disassembled, repaired and reused before being recycled?\nThis would not necessarily be a poor strategy for businesses, there are business models that provide opportunities to retain ownership of valuable products and components through leasing, servicing, repair and re-sale.\nWhile it is choices made by consumers that will ultimately determine the success of such ventures, there is huge potential for the reuse of goods and materials to deliver social and economic and environmental benefits. The EU Circular Economy Package, the Scottish Circular Economy Strategy and the national reuse target set by the Spanish Government are examples of governments recognising that second-hand goods should be a good value mainstream option and are working towards making reuse easier for consumers.\nIn environmental terms, reuse ought to be more common than recycling and , with both the financial and environmental costs of simple refurbishment of some products being a fraction of original manufacturing costs. If we are going to be serious about living in a Circular Economy we need to recognise the value of our waste and ensure resources are kept in the economy for longer, slow down the use of valuable raw materials and ensure that products are reused and materials are recycled rather than landfilled.\nThe most involved reuse organizations are \"repair and overhaul\" industries which take valuable parts, such as , , , , , and  (CRTs) and refurbish them in a factory environment in order to meet the same/similar specifications as new products.  (copy machines), and  are examples of refurbishing factories in the USA.  has a very large aircraft remanufacturing factory in Singapore;  recently announced the opening of a tractor refurbishing plant in China. Some factories operate in competition with the  (OEM). When the refurbished item is resold under a new label (used monitor CRTs made into TVs, or cameras resold under a new label) this has been found legal by most courts.\nWhen the item is resold under the same OEM name, it is informally considered a \"gray market\" item - if it is sold as used, it's legal, if it's represented as an OEM product eligible for  and , it is considered \"counterfeit\" or \"black market\". The automobile parts industry in the USA is governed by laws on the disclosure of \"used\" parts and, in some states,  which have been used are required to be sanitized or destroyed. Whether these laws are in place to protect consumers from black market items, or to protect manufacturers (\"hindsight obsolescence\"), is often an area of intense debate. Fuji Photo Film Co. v. Jazz Photo Corp. is a recent example of the war between patent holders and refurbishing factories. To quote the 2003 District Court of New Jersey:\n programs offer customers a financial incentive to return  for reuse. Although no longer common, international experience is showing that they can still be an effective way to encourage packaging reuse. However, financial incentive, unless great, may be less of an incentive than convenience: statistics show that, on average, a milk bottle is returned 12 times, whereas a lemonade bottle with a 15p deposit is returned, on average, only 3 times.\nRefillable bottles are used extensively in many European countries; for example in , 98% of bottles are refillable, and 98% of those are returned by consumers. These systems are typically supported by  and other regulations.\nSainsbury Ltd have operated a  cash refund scheme in 1991 - \u201cthe penny back scheme\u201d. The scheme is reported to save 970 tonnes of plastic per annum. The scheme has now been extended to a penny back on a voucher which can be contributed to schools registered on the scheme; it estimates this will raise the savings in plastic to 2500 tonnes per annum.\nIn some developing nations like India and Pakistan, the cost of new bottles often forces manufacturers to collect and refill old glass bottles for selling  and other drinks. India and Pakistan also have a way of reusing old newspapers: \"Kabadiwalas\" buy these from the readers for scrap value and reuse them as packaging or recycle them. Scrap intermediaries help consumer dispose of other materials including metals and plastics.\nThese apply primarily to items of packaging, for example, where a company is involved in the regular transportation of goods from a central manufacturing facility to warehouses or warehouses to retail outlets. In these cases there is considerable benefit to using reusable \u201ctransport packaging\u201d such as plastic crates or pallets.\nThe benefits of closed-loop reuse are primarily due to low additional transport costs being involved, the empty lorry returning with the empty crates.\nThere have been some recent attempts to get the public to join in on closed loop reuse schemes  where shoppers use reusable plastic baskets in place of carrier bags for transporting their goods home from the supermarket; these baskets fit on specially designed trolleys making shopping supposedly easier.\nThere have been some market-led initiatives to encourage packaging reuse by companies introducing  of certain commodities (mainly soap powders and cleaning fluids), the contents being transferred before use into a reusable package kept by the customer, with the savings in packaging being passed onto the customer by lower shelf prices. The refill pack itself is not reused, but being a minimal package for carrying the product home, it requires less material than one with the durability and features (reclosable top, convenient shape, etc.) required for easy use of the product, while avoiding the transport cost and emissions of returning the reusable package to the factory.\nSome items, such as clothes and children's toys, often become unwanted before they wear out due to changes in their owner's needs or preferences; these can be reused by selling or giving them to new owners. Regiving can take place informally between family, friends, or neighbours, through environmental  organisations or through anti-poverty charities such as the , , , and  which give these items to those who could not afford them new. Other organizations such as  have websites where both new and used goods can be offered to any of America's school teachers so their life can be extended and help schoolchildren. The average American, for example, throws away 67.9 pounds of used clothing and rags. With the U.S. population at approximately 296 million people, that translates into 20 billion pounds of used clothing and textiles that are tossed into the landfills each year. This has partly motivated movements such as , whose members promise not to buy anything new for a year, and rely on reusing items that otherwise would be thrown away. Reuse not only reduces  inline with the  program but can help raise money for a good cause.\nPrinter  can be reused. They are sorted by brand and model, to be refilled or resold back to the manufacturers. The companies then refill the ink reservoir to resell to consumers.  are recycled the same way as ink cartridges, using toner instead of ink. This method is highly efficient as there is no energy spent on melting and recreating the cartridges.\nRepurposing is to use a tool for use as another tool, usually for a purpose unintended by the original tool-maker. Typically, repurposing is done using items usually considered to be junk or garbage. A good example of this would be the  style of house, that uses tires as insulating walls and bottles as glass walls. Reuse is not limited to repeated uses for the same purpose.  Examples of repurposing include using tires as  and  or plastic drums as  and/or composting bins.\nA , or virtual exchange, facilitates the use of a waste product from one process as a raw material for another. As with new life reuse of finished items, this avoids the environmental costs of disposing of the waste and obtaining new raw material, and may still be possible if the nature of the process makes avoiding production of the waste or recycling it back into the original process impossible.\nThis sort of scheme needs to have a far broader base than is currently the case, it requires organization and the setting up of waste brokerages where lists of currently available wastes are and the quantities available. One of the problems is once a demand for a waste is known or shown then the material is no longer a \u201cwaste\u201d but a sellable commodity which often prices itself out of the market, c.f waste cement kiln dust and N-viro (lime conditioned sewage sludge fertilizer). In the former , organic household waste was collected and used as fodder for pigs. This integrated system was made possible by the state's control of agriculture; the complexities of continuing it in a market economy after German reunification meant the system had to be discontinued.\nThe nutrients, i.e. nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and micronutrients, and organic matter contained in , excreta ( and ) and  have traditionally been reused in agriculture in many countries and are still being reused in agriculture to this day - unfortunately often in an unregulated and unsafe manner. This is particularly a problem in many developing countries (e.g. Mexico, India, Bangladesh, Ghana) where untreated or poorly treated wastewater is used directly in agriculture. The WHO Guidelines from 2006 have set up a framework how this reuse can be done safely by following a multiple barrier approach. Work by the  has led to a better understanding on how such wastewater reuse can be safely implemented in practice, for which they won the  in 2012. Reuse of sanitised excreta in agriculture has also been called a \"closing the loop\" approach for sanitation and agriculture and is central to the  approach.\nDetermining the balance of how the several effects of reuse interact is often best accomplished by a formal . For example, research has shown that reusing a product can reduce CO2 emissions and carbon footprint by more than 50% relative to the complete product life cycle. A relatively unknown effective way to reduce CO2 emissions and carbon footprint is reusing products. Often the relative carbon footprint of manufacturing and the  is unknown. A scientific methodology has been developed to calculate how much CO2 emissions are reduced when buying used or second hand hardware versus new hardware, the so-called durability greener network calculator.\nThere are many ways of measuring the positive environmental, economic and social impact data. These include:\nA  is an : a charge on items that reflects the environmental costs of their manufacture and disposal. This makes the environmental benefit of using one reusable item instead of many disposable ones into a financial incentive. Such charges have been introduced in some countries.\n differs from reuse in that it breaks down the item into raw materials which are then used to make new items, as opposed to reusing the intact item. As this extra processing requires energy, as a rule of thumb reuse is environmentally preferable to recycling (\"\"), though recycling does have a significant part to play as it can often make use of items which are broken, worn out or otherwise unsuitable for reuse.  However, as transport emissions are significant portion of the environmental impact of both reuse and recycling, in some cases recycling is the more prudent course as reuse can require long transport distances. A complex  may be required during a product's design phase to determine the efficacy of reuse, recycling, or neither, and produce accordingly.\nBesides physical resources,  is often reused, notably  for the software that drives computers and the , but also the  that explains how to use every modern device. And it is proposed as a way to improve education by assembling a great library of shareable  that can be reused in .\nSoftware reuse grew out of the standard  libraries of the 1960s. It is the main principle of today's . Instead of constantly reinventing software wheels,  like , , , and others are building vast collections of reusable software objects and .\nReuse of information has a tremendous  for organizations whose  is translated into many languages.  systems can store text that has already been translated into dozens of languages for retrieval and reuse.\nReuse of older software is popular among .  Most of the time,  are used to run older software from other platforms, or other .\nSometimes, older operating systems such as  are reused for computing roles that don't demand lots of computing power.  However, the widespread of availability of secondhand  computers at extreme low prices has largely supplanted immediate opportunities for using DOS on some repurposing applications, especially since something like  isn't found on most pre-Windows XP computers.\n"},

Used electronics which are destined for refurbishment, reuse, resale, salvage recycling through material recovery, or disposal are also considered e-waste. Informal processing of e-waste in  can lead to adverse human health effects and .\nElectronic scrap components, such as , contain potentially harmful materials such as , , , or .  may involve significant risk to health of workers and their communities.\nE-waste or electronic waste is created when an  is discarded after the end of its useful life. The rapid expansion of  and the consumption driven society results in the creation of a very large amount of e-waste in every minute.\nThe European  classifies waste in ten categories: Large household appliances (including cooling and freezing appliances), Small household appliances, IT equipment (including monitors), Consumer electronics (including TVs), Lamps and Luminaires, Toys, Tools, Medical devices, Monitoring and control instruments and Automatic dispensers. These include used electronics which are destined for reuse, resale, salvage, recycling, or disposal as well as re-usables (working and repairable electronics) and secondary raw materials (copper, steel, plastic, etc.). The term \"waste\" is reserved for residue or material which is dumped by the buyer rather than recycled, including residue from reuse and recycling operations, because loads of surplus electronics are frequently commingled (good, recyclable, and non-recyclable). Several public policy advocates apply the term \"e-waste\" and \"e-scrap\" broadly to all surplus electronics.  (CRTs) are considered one of the hardest types to recycle.\nOn the other hand, the Partnership on Measuring ICT for Development defines e-waste into six categories, namely\u00a0: (1) Temperature exchange equipment (e.g., air conditioners, freezers), (2) Screens, monitors (e.g., TV, laptop), (3) Lamps(e.g., LED lamps), (4) Large equipment (e.g., washing machines, electric stoves), (5) Small equipment (e.g., microwave, electric shaver), and (6) Small IT and telecommunication equipment (e.g., mobile phones, printers). Products in each category vary in longevity profile, impact, and collection methods, among other differences.\nCRTs have a relatively high concentration of lead and  (not to be confused with phosphorus), both of which are necessary for the display.  The  (EPA) includes discarded CRT monitors in its category of \"hazardous household waste\" but considers CRTs that have been set aside for testing to be commodities if they are not discarded, speculatively accumulated, or left unprotected from weather and other damage. These CRT devices are often confused between the DLP Rear Projection TV, both of which have a different recycling process due to the materials of which they are composed.\nThe EU and its member states operate a system via the European Waste Catalogue (EWC) - a European Council Directive, which is interpreted into \"member state law\". In the UK, this is in the form of the List of Wastes Directive. However, the list (and EWC) gives a broad definition (EWC Code 16 02 13*) of what is hazardous electronic waste, requiring \"waste operators\" to employ the Hazardous Waste Regulations (Annex 1A, Annex 1B) for refined definition. Constituent materials in the waste also require assessment via the combination of Annex II and Annex III, again allowing operators to further determine whether a waste is hazardous.\nDebate continues over the distinction between \"commodity\" and \"waste\" electronics definitions. Some exporters are accused of deliberately leaving difficult-to-recycle, obsolete, or non-repairable equipment mixed in loads of working equipment (though this may also come through ignorance, or to avoid more costly treatment processes). Protectionists may broaden the definition of \"waste\" electronics in order to protect domestic markets from working secondary equipment.\nThe high value of the  subset of electronic waste (working and reusable laptops, desktops, and components like ) can help pay the cost of transportation for a larger number of worthless pieces than what can be achieved with display devices, which have less (or negative) scrap value. In A 2011 report, \"Ghana E-Waste Country Assessment\", found that of 215,000 tons of electronics imported to Ghana, 30% were brand new and 70% were used. Of the used product, the study concluded that 15% was not reused and was scrapped or discarded. This contrasts with published but uncredited claims that 80% of the imports into Ghana were being burned in primitive conditions.\nE-waste is considered the \u201cfastest-growing waste stream in the world\u201d with 44.7 million tonnes generated in 2016- equivalent to 4500 Eiffel towers. In 2018, an estimated 50 million tonnes of e-waste was reported, thus the name \u2018tsunami of e-waste\u2019 given by the UN. Its value is at least $62.5 billion annually.\nRapid changes in technology, changes in media (tapes, software, MP3), falling prices, and  have resulted in a fast-growing surplus of electronic waste around the globe. Technical solutions are available, but in most cases, a legal framework, a collection, logistics, and other services need to be implemented before a technical solution can be applied.\nDisplay units (CRT, LCD, LED monitors), processors (CPU, GPU, or APU chips), memory (DRAM or SRAM), and audio components have different useful lives.  Processors are most frequently out-dated (by software no longer being optimized) and are more likely to become \"e-waste\" while display units are most often replaced while working without repair attempts, due to changes in wealthy nation appetites for new display technology. This problem could potentially be solved with  or . These types of phones are more durable and have the technology to change certain parts of the phone making them more environmentally friendly. Being able to simply replace the part of the phone that is broken will reduce e-waste.\nAn estimated 50 million tons of E-waste are produced each year. The USA discards 30 million computers each year and 100 million phones are disposed of in Europe each year. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that only 15\u201320% of e-waste is recycled, the rest of these electronics go directly into landfills and incinerators.\nIn 2006, the United Nations estimated the amount of worldwide electronic waste discarded each year to be 50 million metric tons. According to a report by UNEP titled, \"Recycling \u2013 from E-Waste to Resources,\" the amount of e-waste being produced \u2013 including mobile phones and computers \u2013 could rise by as much as 500 percent over the next decade in some countries, such as India.  The United States is the world leader in producing electronic waste, tossing away about 3 million tons each year. China already produces about 2.3\u00a0million tons (2010 estimate) domestically, second only to the United States. And, despite having banned e-waste imports. China remains a major e-waste dumping ground for developed countries.\nSociety today revolves around technology and by the constant need for the newest and most high-tech products we are contributing to a mass amount of e-waste. Since the invention of the iPhone, cell phones have become the top source of e-waste products because they are not made to last more than two years. Electrical waste contains hazardous but also valuable and scarce materials. Up to 60 elements can be found in complex electronics. As of 2013, Apple has sold over 796 million iDevices (iPod, iPhone, iPad). Cell phone companies make cell phones that are not made to last so that the consumer will purchase new phones. Companies give these products such short lifespans because they know that the consumer will want a new product and will buy it if they make it. In the United States, an estimated 70% of heavy metals in landfills comes from discarded electronics.\nWhile there is agreement that the number of discarded electronic devices is increasing, there is considerable disagreement about the relative risk (compared to automobile scrap, for example), and strong disagreement whether curtailing trade in used electronics will improve conditions, or make them worse.  According to an article in , attempts to restrict the trade have driven reputable companies out of the supply chain, with unintended consequences.\n\nIn 2016, Asia was the territory that brought about by significant the most extensive volume of e-waste (18.2 Mt), accompanied by Europe (12.3 metric tons), America (11.3 metric tons), Africa (2.2 metric tons), and Oceania (0.7 metric tons). The smallest in terms of total e-waste made, Oceania was the largest generator of e-waste per citizen (17.3\u00a0kg/inch), with hardly 6% of e-waste cited to be gathered and recycled. Europe is the second broadest generator of e-waste per citizen, with an average of 16.6\u00a0kg/inch; however, Europe bears the loftiest assemblage figure (35%). America generates 11.6\u00a0kg/inch and solicits only 17% of the e-waste caused in the provinces, which is commensurate to the assortment count in Asia (15%). However, Asia generates fewer e-waste per citizen (4,2\u00a0kg/inch). Africa generates only 1.9\u00a0kg/inch, and limited information is available on its collection percentage. The record furnishes regional breakdowns for Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe, and Oceania. The phenomenon somewhat illustrates the modest number figure linked to the overall volume of e-waste made that  41 countries have administrator e-waste data. For 16 other countries, e-waste volumes were collected from exploration and evaluated. The outcome of a considerable bulk of the e-waste (34.1 Metric tons) is unidentified. In countries where there is no national e-waste constitution in the stand, e-waste is possible interpreted as an alternative or general waste. This is land-filled or recycled, along with alternative metal or plastic scraps. There is the colossal compromise that the toxins are not drawn want of accordingly, or they are chosen want of by an informal sector and converted without well safeguarding the laborers while venting the contaminations in e-waste. Although the e-waste claim is on the rise, a flourishing quantity of countries are embracing e-waste regulation. National e-waste governance orders enclose 66% of the world population, a rise from 44% that was reached in 2014\nLooking at European continent, European Union has addressed the issue of electronic Waste by introducing two pieces of legislation. The first legislation, named \"The Directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment\" or \"WEEE directive\" entered into force in 2003.  The main aim of this directive was to regulate and motivate electronic waste recycling and re-use in member states at that moment. This regulative was revised in 2008, and the new WEEE directive came into force in 2014. Furthermore, European Union has also implemented the Directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronica equipment in 2003. This documents was additionally revised in 2012. When it comes to Western Balkan countries, North Macedonia has adopted a Law on Batteries and Accumulators in 2010, followed by the Law on Management of electrical and electronic equipment in 2012. Serbia has regulated management of special waste stream, including electronic waste, by National waste management strategy (2010-2019). Montenegro has adopted Concessionary Act concerning electronic waste with ambition to collect 4\u00a0kg of this waste annually per person until 2020.  Albanian legal framework is based on the draft act on waste from electrical and electronic equipment from 2011 which focuses on the design of electrical and electronic equipment. Contrary to this, Bosnia and Herzegovina is still missing a law regulating electronic waste.\nEuropean Union has addressed the e-waste issue by adopting several directives on the matter. In 2011 an amendment was made to a 2003 Directive 2002/95/EC regarding restriction of the use of hazardous materials in the planning and manufacturing process in the EEE. In the 2011 Directive, 2011/65/EU it was stated as the motivation for more specific restriction on the usage of hazardous materials in the planning and manufacturing process of electronic and electrical devices as there was a disparity of the EU Member State laws and the need arose to set forth rules to protect human health and for the environmentally sound recovery and disposal of WEEE. (2011/65/EU, (2)) The Directive lists several substances subject to restriction. The Directive states restricted substances for maximum concentration values tolerated by weight in homogeneous materials are the following: lead (0,1\u00a0%); mercury (0,1\u00a0%), cadmium (0,1\u00a0%), hexavalent chromium (0,1\u00a0%), polybrominated biphenyls (PBB) (0,1\u00a0%) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) (o,1\u00a0%). If technologically feasible and substitution is available, the usage of substitution is required.\nThere are, however, exemptions in the case in which substitution is not possible from the scientific and technical point of view. The allowance and duration of the substitutions should take into account the availability of the substitute and the socioeconomic impact of the substitute. (2011/65/EU, (18)) \u00a0\nThe European Union Directive 2012/19/EU regulates the WEEE and lays down measures to safeguard the ecosystem and human health by inhibiting or shortening the impact of the generation and management of waste of WEEE. (2012/19/EU, (1)) The Directive takes a specific approach to the product design of EEE. It states in Article 4 that Member States are under the constraint to expedite the kind of model and manufacturing process as well as cooperation between producers and recyclers as to facilitate re-use, dismantling and recovery of WEEE, its components, and materials. (2012/19/EU, (4)) The Member States should create measures to make sure the producers of EEE use eco-design, meaning that the type of manufacturing process is used that would not restrict later re-use of WEEE. The Directive also gives Member States the obligation to ensure a separate collection and transportation of different WEEE. Article 8 lays out the requirements of the proper treatment of WEEE. The base minimum of proper treatment that is required for every WEEE is the removal of all liquids. The recovery targets set are seen in the following figures.\nBu the Annex I of Directive 2012/19/EU the categories of EEE covered are as follows:\nMinimum recovery targets referred in Directive 2012/19/EU starting from 15 August 2018:\nWEEE falling within category 1 or 10 of Annex I\n- 85% shall be recovered, and 80% shall be prepared for re-use and recycled;\nWEEE falling within category 3 or 4 of Annex I\n- 80% shall be recovered, and 70% shall be prepared for re-use and recycled;\nWEEE falling  within category 2, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9 of Annex I\n-75% shall be recovered, and 55% shall be prepared for re-use and recycled;\n\nFor gas and discharged lamps, 80% shall be recycled.A report by the United Nations Environment Management Group lists key processes and agreements made by various organizations globally in an effort to manage and control e-waste. Details about the policies could be retrieved in the links below.\nOne theory is that increased regulation of electronic wastes and concern over the environmental harm in nature economies creates an economic disincentive to remove residues prior to export.  Critics of trade in used electronics maintain that it is still too easy for brokers calling themselves recyclers to export unscreened electronic waste to developing countries, such as China, India and parts of Africa, thus avoiding the expense of removing items like bad cathode ray tubes (the processing of which is expensive and difficult). The developing countries have become toxic dump yards of e-waste. Developing countries receiving foreign e-waste often go further to repair and recycle forsaken equipment. Yet still 90% of e-waste ended up in landfills in developing countries in 2003.  Proponents of international trade point to the success of  programs in other industries, where cooperation has led to creation of sustainable jobs and can bring affordable technology in countries where repair and reuse rates are higher.\nDefenders of the trade in used electronics say that extraction of metals from virgin mining has been shifted to developing countries.  Recycling of copper, silver, gold, and other materials from discarded electronic devices is considered better for the environment than mining. They also state that repair and reuse of computers and televisions has become a \"lost art\" in wealthier nations and that refurbishing has traditionally been a path to development.\nSouth Korea, Taiwan, and southern China all excelled in finding \"retained value\" in used goods, and in some cases have set up billion-dollar industries in refurbishing used ink cartridges, single-use cameras, and working CRTs. Refurbishing has traditionally been a threat to established manufacturing, and simple protectionism explains some criticism of the trade. Works like \"\" by  explain some of the criticism of exports of working product, for example, the ban on import of tested working  laptops to China, or the bans on export of used surplus working electronics by Japan.\nOpponents of surplus electronics exports argue that lower environmental and labour standards, cheap labour, and the relatively high value of recovered raw materials lead to a transfer of pollution-generating activities, such as smelting of copper wire. Electronic waste is often sent to various African and Asian countries such as China, Malaysia, India, and Kenya for processing, sometimes illegally. Many surplus laptops are routed to  as \"dumping grounds for e-waste\".\nBecause the United States has not ratified the  or its , and has few domestic federal laws forbidding the export of toxic waste, the  estimates that about 80% of the electronic waste directed to recycling in the U.S. does not get recycled there at all, but is put on  and sent to countries such as China. This figure is disputed as an exaggeration by the EPA, the , and the .\nIndependent research by  showed that 87\u201388% of imported used computers did not have a higher value than the best value of the constituent materials they contained, and that \"the official trade in end-of-life computers is thus driven by reuse as opposed to recycling\".\nProponents of the trade say growth of internet access is a stronger correlation to trade than poverty.  is poor and closer to the  than southeast Asia, but far more electronic waste is exported from New York to Asia than to Haiti. Thousands of men, women, and children are employed in reuse, refurbishing, repair, and re-manufacturing, unsustainable industries in decline in developed countries.  Denying developing nations access to used electronics may deny them sustainable employment, affordable products, and internet access, or force them to deal with even less scrupulous suppliers.  In a series of seven articles for The Atlantic, Shanghai-based reporter Adam Minter describes many of these computer repair and scrap separation activities as objectively sustainable.\nOpponents of the trade argue that developing countries utilize methods that are more harmful and more wasteful. An expedient and prevalent method is simply to toss equipment onto an open fire, in order to melt plastics and to burn away non-valuable metals. This releases  and  into the air, contributing to an acrid, lingering smog. These noxious fumes include  and . Bonfire refuse can be disposed of quickly into drainage ditches or waterways feeding the ocean or local water supplies.\nIn June 2008, a container of electronic waste, destined from the Port of Oakland in the U.S. to  in mainland China, was intercepted in Hong Kong by . Concern over exports of electronic waste were raised in press reports in India, Ghana, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, and Nigeria.\nThe research that was undertaken by the Countering WEEE Illegal Trade (CWIT) project, funded by , found that in Europe, only 35% (3.3 million tons) of all the e-waste discarded in 2012, ended up in the officially reported amounts of collection and recycling systems.\nThe other 65% (6.15 million tons) was either:\n in the  region of China is a massive electronic waste processing community. It is often referred to as the \"e-waste capital of the world.\" Traditionally, Guiyu was an agricultural community; however, in the mid-1990s it transformed into an e-waste recycling center involving over 75% of the local households and an additional 100,000 migrant workers. Thousands of individual workshops employ laborers to snip cables, pry chips from circuit boards, grind plastic computer cases into particles, and dip circuit boards in acid baths to dissolve the precious metals. Others work to strip insulation from all wiring in an attempt to salvage tiny amounts of copper wire. Uncontrolled burning, disassembly, and disposal has led to a number of environmental problems such as groundwater contamination, atmospheric pollution, and  either by immediate discharge or from  (especially near coastal areas), as well as health problems including  effects among those directly and indirectly involved, due to the methods of processing the waste.\nSix of the many villages in Guiyu specialize in circuit-board disassembly, seven in plastics and metals reprocessing, and two in wire and cable disassembly. Greenpeace, an environmental group, sampled dust, soil, river sediment, and groundwater in Guiyu. They found very high levels of toxic heavy metals and organic contaminants in both places. Lai Yun, a campaigner for the group found \"over 10 poisonous metals, such as lead, mercury, and cadmium.\"\nGuiyu is only one example of digital dumps but similar places can be found across the world in Nigeria, Ghana, and India.\nGuiyu is likely one of the oldest and largest informal e-waste recycling sites in the world; however, there are many sites worldwide, including India, Ghana (), Nigeria, and the Philippines. Most research involving informal e-waste recycling has been done in Guiyu, but there are a handful of studies that describe exposure levels in e-waste workers, the community, and the environment. For example, locals and migrant workers in Delhi, a northern union territory of India, scavenge discarded computer equipment and extract base metals using toxic, unsafe methods. Bangalore, located in southern India, is often referred as the \"Silicon Valley of India\" and has a growing informal e-waste recycling sector. A studies found that e-waste workers in the slum community had higher levels of V, Cr, Mn, Mo, Sn, Tl, and Pb than workers at an e-waste recycling facility.\nA recent study about the rising electronic pollution in the USA revealed that the average computer screen has five to eight pounds or more of Lead representing 40 percent of all the lead in US landfills. All these toxins are persistent, bioaccumulative toxins (PBTs) that create environmental and health risks when computers are incinerated, put in landfills or melted down. The emission of fumes, gases, and particulate matter into the air, the discharge of liquid waste into water and drainage systems, and the disposal of hazardous wastes contribute to environmental degradation. The processes of dismantling and disposing of electronic waste in developing countries led to a number of environmental impacts as illustrated in the graphic. Liquid and atmospheric releases end up in bodies of water, groundwater, soil, and air and therefore in land and sea animals \u2013 both domesticated and wild, in crops eaten by both animals and human, and in drinking water.\nOne study of environmental effects in Guiyu, China found the following:\nThe  area of , where about 40,000 people live, provides an example of how e-waste contamination can pervade the daily lives of nearly all residents. Into this area\u2014one of the largest informal e-waste dumping and processing sites in Africa\u2014about 215,000 tons of secondhand consumer electronics, primarily from Western Europe, are imported annually. Because this region has considerable overlap among industrial, commercial, and residential zones, Pure Earth (formerly Blacksmith Institute) has ranked Agbogbloshie as one of the world's 10 worst toxic threats (Blacksmith Institute 2013).\nA separate study at the Agbogbloshie e-waste dump, Ghana found a presence of lead levels as high as 18,125 ppm in the soil. US EPA standard for lead in soil in play areas is 400 ppm and 1200 ppm for non-play areas. Scrap workers at the Agbogbloshie e-waste dump regularly burn electronic components and auto harness wires for copper recovery, releasing toxic chemicals like lead, dioxins and furans into the environment.\nResearchers such as Brett Robinson, a professor of soil and physical sciences at Lincoln University in , warn that wind patterns in Southeast China disperse toxic particles released by open-air burning across the , home to 45 million people. In this way, toxic chemicals from e-waste enter the \"soil-crop-food pathway,\" one of the most significant routes for heavy metals' exposure to humans. These chemicals are not biodegradable\u2014 they persist in the environment for long periods of time, increasing exposure risk.\nIn the agricultural district of , in the east of , local villagers had lost their main water source as a result of e-waste dumping. The  fields were transformed in late 2017, when a nearby Chinese-run factory started bringing in foreign e-waste items such as crushed computers, circuit boards and cables for recycling to mine the electronics for valuable metal components like copper, silver and gold. But the items also contain lead, cadmium and mercury, which are highly toxic if mishandled during processing. Apart from feeling faint from noxious fumes emitted during processing, a local claimed the factory has also contaminated her water. \"When it was raining, the water went through the pile of waste and passed our house and went into the soil and water system. Water tests conducted in the province by environmental group Earth and the local government both found toxic levels of iron, manganese, lead, nickel and in some cases arsenic and cadmium. \"The communities observed when they used water from the shallow well, there was some development of skin disease or there are foul smells,\" founder of Earth, Penchom Saetang said. \"This is proof, that it is true, as the communities suspected, there are problems happening to their water sources.\"\n\n\nDepending on the age and type of the discarded item, the chemical composition of E-waste may vary. Most E-waste are composed of a mixture of metals like Cu, Al and Fe. They might be attached to, covered with or even mixed with various types of plastics and ceramics. E-waste has a horrible effect on the environment and it is important to dispose it with an  recycling facility. Some major impacts of E-waste on environment are,\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 Toxic materials like lead, zinc, nickel, flame retardants, barium and chromium, found in computers and most electronics, if released into the environment, can cause damage to human blood, kidneys as well as central and peripheral nervous system.\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 The damage caused by warming up of E-waste releasing toxic chemicals into the air and damaging the atmosphere is one of the biggest environmental impacts from E-waste. This will result in number of airborne diseases and increase the toxicity of air, making it unfit for breathing and living.\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 The electronic waste, which often gets thrown out into landfills, release toxins, which seep into ground water. This affects both land and sea animals. Especially in developing countries, where most of the electronic waste is dumped in landfills, also affects the health of the people. This contamination of soil will also result in loss of vegetation and affecting the ecosystem.\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 The electronic waste which is created via cell phones, especially in countries like United States, where most Americans get new cell phones every 12 to 18 months. And only 10 percent of these cell phones are recycled. This creates more and more E-waste with lack of responsible recycling, the environmental issues of E-waste are continually increasing. Mobile phones are \"considered hazardous waste\" in California; many chemicals in such phones leach from landfills into the groundwater system.\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 In places like , which receives shipments of toxic E-wastes from all over the world, the largest E-waste disposal site, many people living around here often exhibit substantial digestives, neurological, respiratory and bone problems.\nProper recycling and disposal of electronics is not only important for the environment but it also has a big impact on data security as well. It's quite easy for anyone to extract personal data from electronic devices. Dragging your important documents to the Recycling Bin won't be enough to keep your data secure. That's because digital information often leaves a trail of breadcrumbs that can be recovered effortlessly using the right hardware.\nPrior to disposing of IT Equipment improperly, always consider all aspects, including data security and liability in addition to the environment. E-waste presents a potential security threat to individuals and exporting countries.  that are not properly erased before the computer is disposed of can be reopened, exposing sensitive information. Credit card numbers, private financial data, account information, and records of  transactions can be accessed by most willing individuals. Organized criminals in Ghana commonly search the drives for information to use in local . Unwanted electronic devices go through several hands during the recycling process. They are dismantled piece by piece by authorized professionals at different facilities. That means there are plenty of opportunities for information to be stolen. But there is a way to avoid this from happening.When e-waste is disposed of improperly and without the use of a company that specializes in proper data destruction, there is a severe risk of identity theft, data breaches and massive liability for the companies involved. Electronic files about government contracts have been discovered on hard drives found in . Multimillion-dollar agreements from United States security institutions such as the  (DIA), the , and  have all resurfaced in Agbogbloshie.\nThere are few ways to properly erase data off harddrives which can be used by both individuals and companies, these steps are;\nRecycling is an essential element of e-waste management. Properly carried out, it should greatly reduce the leakage of toxic materials into the environment and mitigate against the exhaustion of natural resources. However, it does need to be encouraged by local authorities and through community education. Less than 20% of e-waste is formally recycled, with 80% either ending up in landfill or being informally recycled \u2013 much of it by hand in developing countries, exposing workers to hazardous and carcinogenic substances such as mercury, lead and cadmium.\nOne of the major challenges is recycling the printed circuit boards from the electronic wastes. The circuit boards contain such precious metals as gold, silver, platinum, etc. and such base metals as copper, iron, aluminum, etc.  One way e-waste is processed is by melting circuit boards, burning cable sheathing to recover copper wire and open- pit acid leaching for separating metals of value. Conventional method employed is mechanical shredding and separation but the recycling efficiency is low. Alternative methods such as  decomposition have been studied for printed circuit board recycling, and some other methods are still under investigation. Properly disposing of or reusing electronics can help prevent health problems, reduce , and create jobs.  and  offer a more environmentally friendly and socially conscious alternative to  processes.\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency encourages electronic recyclers to become certified by demonstrating to an accredited, independent third party auditor that they meet specific standards to safely recycle and manage electronics.  This should work so as to ensure the highest environmental standards are being maintained.  Two certifications for electronic recyclers currently exist and are endorsed by the EPA.  Customers are encouraged to choose certified electronics recyclers.  Responsible electronics recycling reduces environmental and human health impacts, increases the use of reusable and refurbished equipment and reduces energy use while conserving limited resources. The two EPA-endorsed certification programs are Responsible Recyclers Practices (R2) and .  Certified companies ensure they are meeting strict environmental standards which maximize reuse and recycling, minimize exposure to human health or the environment, ensure safe management of materials and require destruction of all data used on electronics. Certified electronics recyclers have demonstrated through audits and other means that they continually meet specific high environmental standards and safely manage used electronics. Once certified, the recycler is held to the particular standard by continual oversight by the independent accredited certifying body. A certification board accredits and oversees certifying bodies to ensure that they meet specific responsibilities and are competent to audit and provide certification.\nSome U.S. retailers offer opportunities for consumer recycling of discarded electronic devices. In the US, the  (CEA) urges consumers to dispose properly of end-of-life electronics through its recycling locator at www.GreenerGadgets.org. This list only includes manufacturer and retailer programs that use the strictest standards and third-party certified recycling locations, to provide consumers assurance that their products will be recycled safely and responsibly. CEA research has found that 58 percent of consumers know where to take their end-of-life electronics, and the electronics industry would very much like to see that level of awareness increase. Consumer electronics manufacturers and retailers sponsor or operate more than 5,000 recycling locations nationwide and have vowed to recycle one billion pounds annually by 2016, a sharp increase from 300 million pounds industry recycled in 2010.\nThe Sustainable Materials Management (SMM) Electronic Challenge was created by the  (EPA) in 2012.  Participants of the Challenge are manufacturers of electronics and electronic retailers. These companies collect end-of-life (EOL) electronics at various locations and send them to a certified, third-party recycler. Program participants are then able publicly promote and report 100% responsible recycling for their companies. The Electronics TakeBack Coalition (ETBC) is a campaign aimed at protecting human health and limiting environmental effects where electronics are being produced, used, and discarded. The ETBC aims to place responsibility for disposal of technology products on electronic manufacturers and brand owners, primarily through community promotions and legal enforcement initiatives. It provides recommendations for consumer recycling and a list of recyclers judged environmentally responsible. While there have been major benefits from the rise in recycling and waste collection created by producers and consumers, such as valuable materials being recovered and kept away from landfill and incineration, there are still many problems present with the EPR system including \u201chow to ensure proper enforcement of recycling standards, what to do about waste with positive net value, and the role of competition,\u201d (Kunz et al.).  Many stakeholders agreed there needs to be a higher standard of accountability and efficiency to improve the systems of recycling everywhere, as well as the growing amount of waste being an opportunity more so than downfall since it gives us more chances to create an efficient system. To make recycling competition more cost-effective, the producers agreed that there needs to be a higher drive for competition because it allows them to have a wider range of producer responsibility organizations to choose from for e-waste recycling.\nThe Certified Electronics Recycler program for electronic recyclers is a comprehensive, integrated management system standard that incorporates key operational and continual improvement elements for quality, environmental and health and safety performance. The grassroots  promotes human health and addresses environmental justice problems resulting from toxins in technologies. The World Reuse, Repair, and Recycling Association (wr3a.org) is an organization dedicated to improving the quality of exported electronics, encouraging better recycling standards in importing countries, and improving practices through \"Fair Trade\" principles. Take Back My TV is a project of The Electronics TakeBack Coalition and grades television manufacturers to find out which are responsible, in the coalition's view, and which are not.\nThere have also been efforts to raise awareness of the potentially hazardous conditions of the dismantling of e-waste in American prisons. The Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition, prisoner-rights activists, and environmental groups released a Toxic Sweatshops report that details how prison labor is being used to handle e-waste, resulting in health consequences among the workers. These groups allege that, since prisons do not have adequate safety standards, inmates are dismantling the products under unhealthy and unsafe conditions.\nIn many developed countries, electronic waste processing usually first involves dismantling the equipment into various parts (metal frames, power supplies, circuit boards, plastics), often by hand, but increasingly by automated shredding equipment. A typical example is the NADIN electronic waste processing plant in , \u2014the largest facility of its kind in Eastern Europe. The advantages of this process are the human worker's ability to recognize and save working and repairable parts, including chips, transistors, RAM, etc. The disadvantage is that the labor is cheapest in countries with the lowest health and safety standards.\nIn an alternative bulk system, a hopper conveys material for shredding into an unsophisticated mechanical separator, with screening and granulating machines to separate constituent metal and plastic fractions, which are sold to  or plastics recyclers. Such recycling machinery is enclosed and employs a . Some of the emissions are caught by scrubbers and screens. Magnets, , and  are employed to separate glass, plastic, and  and nonferrous metals, which can then be further separated at a .\nLeaded glass from CRTs is reused in car batteries, ammunition, and lead wheel weights, or sold to foundries as a  in processing raw . Copper, gold, palladium, silver and tin are valuable metals sold to  for recycling. Hazardous smoke and gases are captured, contained and treated to mitigate environmental threat. These methods allow for safe reclamation of all valuable computer construction materials. Hewlett-Packard product recycling solutions manager Renee St. Denis describes its process as: \"We move them through giant shredders about 30 feet tall and it shreds everything into pieces about the size of a quarter. Once your disk drive is shredded into pieces about this big, it's hard to get the data off\". An ideal electronic waste recycling plant combines dismantling for component recovery with increased cost-effective processing of bulk electronic waste. Reuse is an alternative option to recycling because it extends the lifespan of a device. Devices still need eventual recycling, but by allowing others to purchase used electronics, recycling can be postponed and value gained from device use.\nRecycling raw materials from end-of-life electronics is the most effective solution to the growing e-waste problem. Most electronic devices contain a variety of materials, including metals that can be recovered for future uses. By dismantling and providing reuse possibilities, intact natural resources are conserved and air and water pollution caused by hazardous disposal is avoided. Additionally, recycling reduces the amount of greenhouse gas emissions caused by the manufacturing of new products. Another benefit of recycling e-waste is that many of the materials can be recycled and re-used again. Materials that can be recycled include \"ferrous (iron-based) and non-ferrous metals, glass, and various .\" \u201cNon-ferrous metals, mainly aluminum and copper can all be re-smelted and re-manufactured. Ferrous metals such as steel and iron also can be re-used.\" Due to the recent surge in popularity in 3D printing, certain 3D printers have been designed (FDM variety) to produce waste that can be easily recycled which decreases the amount of harmful pollutants in the atmosphere. The excess plastic from these printers that comes out as a byproduct can also be reused to create new 3D printed creations.\nBenefits of recycling are extended when responsible recycling methods are used. In the U.S., responsible recycling aims to minimize the dangers to human health and the environment that disposed and dismantled electronics can create. Responsible recycling ensures best management practices of the electronics being recycled, worker health and safety, and consideration for the environment locally and abroad. In Europe, metals that are recycled are returned to companies of origin at a reduced cost. Through a committed recycling system, manufacturers in Japan have been pushed to make their products more sustainable. Since many companies were responsible for the recycling of their own products, this imposed responsibility on manufacturers requiring many to redesign their infrastructure. As a result, manufacturers in Japan have the added option to sell the recycled metals.\nImproper management of e-waste is resulting in a significant loss of scarce and valuable raw materials, such as gold, platinum, cobalt and rare earth elements. As much as 7% of the world's gold may currently be contained in e-waste, with 100 times more gold in a tonne of e-waste than in a tonne of gold ore.\nElectronic waste can be disposed of by burial, burning, or dissolution and recovery of metals. All processes require proper containment to prevent contamination of air, groundwater, or soil with heavy metals such as lead or cadmium, or toxic combustion products.\nSome high-value components may be salvaged from printed circuit boards.\nThere are several ways to curb the environmental hazards arising from the recycling of electronic waste and save our planet. One of the factors which exacerbate the e-waste problem is the diminishing lifetime of many electrical and electronic goods. There are two drivers (in particular) for this trend. On the one hand, consumer demand for low cost products mitigates against product quality and results in short product lifetimes. On the other, manufacturers in some sectors encourage a regular upgrade cycle, and may even enforce it though restricted availability of spare parts, service manuals and software updates, or through .\nConsumer dissatisfaction with this state of affairs has led to a growing repair movement. Often, this is at a community level such as through repair caf\u0117s or the \"restart parties\" promoted by the Restart Project.\nThe \"\" is spearheaded in the US by farmers dissatisfied with non-availability of service information, specialised tools and spare parts for their high-tech farm machinery. But the movement extends far beyond farm machinery with, for example, the restricted repair options offered by Apple coming in for criticism. Manufacturers often counter with safety concerns resulting from unauthorised repairs and modifications.\nAlso,one of the best and easiest methods of reducing the electronic waste footprint is to sell or donate your electronic gadgets to those in need rather than thrash them.\nImproperly disposed e-waste is becoming more and more hazardous, especially as the sheer volume of our e-waste increases.For this reason, large brands like Apple, Samsung, and other companies have started giving options to its customers to recycle old electronics.Recycling old electronics allows the expensive electronic parts inside to be reused. This can save a lot of energy and reduce the need for mining of new raw resources, or manufacturing new parts.You can find electronic recycling programs in your local area by doing a Google search for \u201crecycle electronics\u201d and your city or area name.\nIn recent times,Cloud services have proven to be much better in storing data which can be accessible from anywhere in the world without the need to carry a storage device at all times. Cloud storage also gives you a large amount of storage, for free or very cheap.This not only offers convenience, it also reduces the need for manufacturing new storage devices which in turn curbs the amount of e-waste generated.\nOne other important measure to curb the generation of electronic waste is to rent rather than out rightly buy  a specific piece of electronic equipment which is not used everything.For example, if you sparingly use industrial weighing scales for measuring, rent the scales instead of buying them.\nThe market has a lot of different types of electrical products. To categorize these products, it is necessary to group them into sensible and practical categories. Classification of the products may even help to determine the process to be used for disposal of the product. Making the classifications, in general, is helping to describe e-waste. Classifications has not defined special details, for example when they do not pose a threat to the environment. On the other hand, classifications should not be too aggregated because of countries differences in interpretation.\nIt is a practical way to collect statistical data and put this data on market. For example, you have a row which has the following information about indication which are in the bracelets: UNU-KEY(001), Description (Central Heating (household installed)), EEE category under EU-10 (1), EEE category under EU-6 (4).\nThe UNU-KEYs system closely follows the harmonized statistical (HS) coding. It is an international nomenclature which is an integrated system to allow classify common basis for customs purposes.\nSome computer components can be reused in assembling new computer products, while others are reduced to metals that can be reused in applications as varied as construction, flatware, and jewellery. Substances found in large quantities include , , ,  (polyvinyl chlorides), , lead, tin, copper, silicon, beryllium, carbon, iron, and aluminium. Elements found in small amounts include , , and . Elements found in trace amounts include americium, antimony, arsenic, barium, bismuth, boron, cobalt, europium, gallium, germanium, gold, indium, lithium, manganese, nickel, niobium, palladium, platinum, rhodium, ruthenium, selenium, silver, tantalum, terbium, thorium, titanium, vanadium, and yttrium. Almost all electronics contain lead and tin (as solder) and copper (as wire and  tracks), though the use of lead-free solder is now spreading rapidly. The following are ordinary applications:\nThere is also evidence of cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of some chemicals, which have been shown to inhibit cell proliferation, cause cell membrane lesion, cause DNA single-strand breaks, and elevate Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) levels.\nResidents living around the e-waste recycling sites, even if they do not involve in e-waste recycling activities, can also face the environmental exposure due to the food, water, and environmental contamination caused by e-waste, because they can easily contact to e-waste contaminated air, water, soil, dust, and food sources. In general, there are three main exposure pathways: inhalation, ingestion, and dermal contact.\nStudies show that people living around e-waste recycling sites have a higher daily intake of heavy metals and a more serious body burden. Potential health risks include mental health, impaired cognitive function, and general physical health damage.() DNA damage was also found more prevalent in all the e-waste exposed populations (i.e. adults, children, and neonates) than the populations in the control area. DNA breaks can increase the likelihood of wrong replication and thus mutation, as well as lead to cancer if the damage is to a tumor suppressor gene .\nPrenatal exposure to e-waste has found to have adverse effects on human body burden of pollutants of the neonates. In Guiyu, one of the most famous e-waste recycling sites in China, it was found that increased cord blood lead concentration of neonates was associated with parents' participation in e-waste recycling processes, as well as how long the mothers spent living in Guiyu and in e-waste recycling factories or workshops during pregnancy. Besides, a higher placental metallothionein (a small protein marking the exposure of toxic metals) was found among neonates from Guiyu as a result of Cd exposure, while the higher Cd level in Guiyu's neonates was related to the involvement in e-waste recycling of their parents. High PFOA exposure of mothers in Guiyu is related to adverse effect on growth of their new-born and the prepotency in this area.\nPrenatal exposure to informal e-waste recycling can also lead to several adverse birth outcomes (still birth, low birth weight, low Apgar scores, etc.) and longterm effects such as behavioral and learning problems of the neonates in their future life.\nChildren are especially sensitive to e-waste exposure because of several reasons, such as their smaller size, higher metabolism rate, larger surface area in relation to their weight, and multiple exposure pathways (for example, dermal, hand-to-mouth, and take-home exposure). They were measured to have an 8-time potential health risk compared to the adult e-waste recycling workers. Studies have found significant higher blood lead levels (BLL) and blood cadmium levels (BCL) of children living in e-waste recycling area compared to those living in control area. For example, one study found that the average BLL in Guiyu was nearly 1.5 times compared to that in the control site (15.3\u00a0ug/dL compared to 9.9\u00a0ug/dL), while the CDC of the United States has set a reference level for blood lead at 5\u00a0ug/dL. The highest concentrations of lead were found in the children of parents whose workshop dealt with circuit boards and the lowest was among those who recycled plastic.\nExposure to e-waste can cause serious health problems to children. Children's exposure to developmental neurotoxins containing in e-waste such as lead, mercury, cadmium, chromium and PBDEs can lead to a higher risk of lower IQ, impaired cognitive function, and other adverse effects. In certain age groups, a decreased lung function of children in e-waste recycling sites has been found. Some studies also found associations between children's e-waste exposure and impaired coagulation, hearing loss, and decreased vaccine antibody tilters in e-waste recycling area.\nThe complex composition and improper handling of e-waste adversely affect human health. A growing body of epidemiological and clinical evidence has led to increased concern about the potential threat of e-waste to human health, especially in developing countries such as India and China. For instance, in terms of health hazards, open burning of printed wiring boards increases the concentration of dioxins in the surrounding areas. These toxins cause an increased risk of cancer if inhaled by workers and local residents. Toxic metals and poison can also enter the bloodstream during the manual extraction and collection of tiny quantities of precious metals, and workers are continuously exposed to poisonous chemicals and fumes of highly concentrated acids. Recovering resalable copper by burning insulated wires causes neurological disorders, and acute exposure to cadmium, found in semiconductors and chip resistors, can damage the kidneys and liver and cause bone loss. Long-term exposure to lead on printed circuit boards and computer and television screens can damage the central and peripheral nervous system and kidneys, and children are more susceptible to these harmful effects.\nThe  (OSHA) has summarized several potential safety hazards of recycling workers in general, such as crushing hazards, hazardous energy released, and toxic metals.\n\nOSHA has also specified some chemical components of electronics that can potentially do harm to e-recycling workers' health, such as lead, mercury, PCBs, asbestos, refractory ceramic fibers (RCFs), and radioactive substances. Besides, in the United States, most of these chemical hazards have specific  (OELs) set by OSHA,  (NIOSH), and  (ACGIH).\nFor the details of health consequences of these chemical hazards, see also .\nInformal e-recycling industry refers to small e-waste recycling workshops with few (if any) automatic procedures and  (PPE). On the other hand, formal e-recycling industry refers to regular e-recycling facilities sorting materials from e-waste with automatic machinery and manual labor, where pollution control and PPE are common. Sometimes formal e-recycling facilities dismantle the e-waste to sort materials, then distribute it to other downstream recycling department to further recover materials such as plastic and metals.\nThe health impact of e-waste recycling workers working in informal industry and formal industry are expect to be different in the extent. Studies in three recycling sites in China suggest that the health risks of workers from formal e-recycling facilities in Jiangsu and Shanghai were lower compared to those worked in informal e-recycling sites in Guiyu.  The primitive methods used by unregulated backyard operators (e.g., the informal sector) to reclaim, reprocess, and recycle e-waste materials expose the workers to a number of toxic substances. Processes such as dismantling components, wet chemical processing, and incineration are used and result in direct exposure and inhalation of harmful chemicals. Safety equipment such as gloves, face masks, and ventilation fans are virtually unknown, and workers often have little idea of what they are handling. In another study of e-waste recycling in India, hair samples were collected from workers at an e-waste recycling facility and an e-waste recycling slum community (informal industry) in Bangalore. Levels of , , , , , , and  were significantly higher in the workers at the e-waste recycling facility compared to the e-waste workers in the slum community. However, , , , and  levels were significantly higher in the slum community workers compared to the facility workers.\nEven in formal e-recycling industry, workers can be exposed to excessive pollutants. Studies in the formal e-recycling facilities in France and Sweden found workers' overexposure (compared to recommended occupational guidelines) to lead, cadmium, mercury and some other metals, as well as BFRs, PCBs, dioxin and furans. Workers in formal industry are also exposed to more brominated flame-retardants than reference groups.\nFor occupational health and safety of e-waste recycling workers, both employers and workers should take actions. Suggestions for the e-waste facility employers and workers given by  are illustrated in the graphic.\nIf the dust contains lead or cadmium:\n\n\n\n\n"},
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_prevention", "title": "WasteminimisationWikipedia", "body": "\n is a set of processes and practices intended to reduce the amount of  produced.  By reducing or eliminating the generation of harmful and persistent wastes, waste minimisation supports efforts to promote a more  society. Waste minimisation involves redesigning products and processes and/or changing societal patterns of  and production.\nThe most environmentally resourceful, , and  way to manage waste often is to not have to address the problem in the first place. Managers see waste minimisation as a primary focus for most  strategies. Proper waste treatment and disposal can require a significant amount of time and resources; therefore, the benefits of waste minimisation can be considerable if carried out in an effective, safe and sustainable manner.\nTraditional waste management focuses on processing waste after it is created, concentrating on , ,  and  conversion. Waste minimisation involves efforts to avoid creating the waste during manufacturing.  To effectively implement waste minimisation the manager requires knowledge of the production process,  (the tracking of materials from their extraction to their return to earth) and details of the composition of the waste.\nThe main sources of waste . In the , most waste comes from the construction and  of buildings, followed by  and quarrying, industry and commerce. Household waste constitutes a relatively small proportion of all waste.  Industrial waste is often tied to requirements in the .  For example, a company handling a product may insist that it should be shipped using particular packing because it fits downstream needs.\nWaste minimisation can  and often turns out to have positive economic benefits.  Waste minimisation can improve:\nIn , using more efficient manufacturing processes and better materials generally reduces the production of waste. The application of waste minimisation techniques has led to the development of innovative and commercially successful replacement products.\nWaste minimisation efforts often require investment, which is usually compensated by the savings. However, waste reduction in one part of the production process may create waste production in another part.\nWaste minimisation and resource maximisation for  can most easily be done at the design stage. Reducing the number of  used in a product or making the product easier to take apart can make it easier to be repaired or recycled at the end of its useful life.\nIn some cases, it may be best not to minimise the volume of  used to make a product, but instead reduce the volume or  of the waste created at the end of a product's life, or the environmental impact of the product's use.  (See section ).\nIn this strategy, products and  are optimally designed to meet their intended use.  This applies especially to , which should only be as durable as necessary to serve their intended purpose. On the other hand, it could be more wasteful if food, which has consumed resources and energy in its production, is damaged and spoiled because of extreme measures to reduce the use of , ,  and  in its packaging.\nImproving , such as extending a 's useful life to 15 years instead of 12, can reduce waste and usually much improves resource optimisation.\nBut in some cases it has a negative .  If a product is too durable, its replacement with more efficient technology is likely to be delayed. Therefore, extending an older machine's useful life may place a heavier burden on the environment than scrapping it, recycling its metal and buying a new model.  Similarly, older vehicles consume more fuel and produce more emissions than their modern counterparts.\nMost proponents of waste minimisation consider that the way forward may be to view any manufactured product at the end of its useful life as a resource for recycling and reuse rather than waste.\nMaking refillable glass  strong enough to withstand several journeys between the  and the  requires making them thicker and so heavier, which increases the resources required to transport them. Since transport has a large environmental impact, careful evaluation is required of the number of return journeys bottles make.  If a refillable bottle is thrown away after being refilled only several times, the resources wasted may be greater than if the bottle had been designed for a single journey..\nMany choices involve trade-offs of environmental impact, and often there is insufficient information to make informed decisions.\nVarious aspects of business practices affect waste, such as the use of  in restaurants.\n are a visible form of re-use, and some stores offer a \"bag credit\" for re-usable shopping bags, although at least  reversed its policy, claiming \"it was just a temporary bonus\".  In contrast, one study suggests that a bag tax is a more effective incentive than a similar discount.  (Of note, the before/after study compared a circumstance in which some stores offered a discount vs. a circumstance in which all stores applying the tax.)  While there is a minor inconvenience involved, this may remedy itself, as reusable bags are generally more convenient for carrying groceries.\nThis section details some waste minimisation techniques for .\nAppropriate amounts and sizes can be chosen when purchasing goods; buying large containers of paint for a small decorating job or buying larger amounts of food than can be consumed create unnecessary waste. Also, if a pack or  is to be thrown away, any remaining contents must be removed before the container can be recycled.\nHome , the practice of turning kitchen and garden waste into compost can be considered waste minimisation.\nThe resources that households use can be reduced considerably by  thoughtfully (e.g. turning off lights and equipment when it is not needed) and by reducing the number of car journeys made. Individuals can reduce the amount of waste they create by buying fewer products and by buying products which last longer. Mending broken or worn items of clothing or equipment also contributes to minimising household waste. Individuals can minimise their water usage, and walk or cycle to their destination rather than using their car to save fuel and cut down emissions.\nIn a domestic situation, the potential for minimisation is often dictated by .  Some people may view it as wasteful to purchase new products solely to follow  when the older products are still usable.  Adults working full-time have little free time, and so may have to purchase more  that require little preparation, or prefer disposable nappies if there is a baby in the family.\nThe amount of waste an individual produces is a small portion of all waste produced by society, and personal waste reduction can only make a small impact on overall waste volumes.  Yet, influence on policy can be exerted in other areas. Increased consumer awareness of the impact and power of certain purchasing decisions allows industry and individuals to change the total .  Consumers can influence manufacturers and distributors by avoiding buying products that do not have , which is currently not mandatory, or choosing products that minimise the use of packaging. In the ,  combines both  and  packaging , in a  packaging  classification system to minimise waste. Where reuse schemes are available, consumers can be proactive and use them.\n establishments are massive producers of waste. The major sources of healthcare waste are:  hospitals, laboratories and research centres, mortuary and autopsy centres, animal research and testing laboratories, blood banks and collection services, and nursing homes for the elderly.\nWaste minimisation can offer many opportunities to these establishments to use fewer resources, be less wasteful and generate less hazardous waste.  Good management and control practices among health-care facilities can have a significant effect on the reduction of waste generated each day.\nThere are many examples of more efficient practices that can encourage waste minimization in healthcare establishments and research facilities\n\n\n\n"},

This is why we describe what we do as .Recology implements recycling programs and builds infrastructure at its facilities to recover recyclables and reduce landfill-bound materials. By seeking out and utilizing new technology systems to sort and extract materials, we\u2019re able to return organic materials to farms as compost, and provide recycled raw materials (such as plastic or aluminum) to manufacturers.While you\u2019re collecting your food scraps and yard trimmings, and accumulating\u00a0your recyclables,\u00a0Recology is\u00a0engineering\u00a0and developing programs and services to recover and reuse both. Take a simple plastic bottle, for example. These plastics can be recycled through the collection and recovery systems at Recology,\u00a0and made into new products, like jackets made from these recycled\u00a0plastic bottles. You might even see your old furniture as part of an  one day.\u00a0 This recovery process is crucial in reducing the impact of waste on our environment, and moving beyond waste.Want to know how\u00a0Recology can help you\u00a0increase\u00a0your recycling and composting efforts at your home or business? \u00a0\u00a0On average, Recology recovers over  of recyclables each year, and we\u2019re continuously researching ways to recycle more items to be made into new products. Our latest engineering effort has been in planning, designing and implementing a system\u00a0constructed to collect and recycle \u201cfilm plastics\u201d \u2013 which are used to make items like grocery bags. Historically, film plastics were a hard-to-recycle item with little to no end-market.\u00a0\u00a0Recology is\u00a0working to change this.Recology designed and built the first large scale compost facility in California in 1996.\u00a0 Today, Recology recovers food scraps and yard trimmings that are disposed of, and from this material manufactures  of compost annually.\u00a0 The compost Recology makes from your organic materials are then used by local farmers to grow food, which is returned to\u00a0you in the form of fresh produce, grains, or even wine. In 2013,\u00a0Recology sold 296 million pounds of compost in California alone. Learn more about our compost by visiting \u00a0Zero waste is more than just a goal for the communities in which we work \u2013 it\u2019s a goal for ; especially in how we work and with whom we partner. Recology has taken significant measures as a company to work toward zero waste.\u00a0 Want to get there with us?\u00a0 See how we\u2019re changing our behavior, and  to schedule a waste audit. Let\u2019s get there together.Recology sees communities as partners. If we don\u2019t work together to determine how to reach zero waste, it simply won\u2019t work.Every community is unique and faces different challenges when it comes to recycling, compost, and landfill collection. We understand these nuances, so after conducting a thorough waste audit to better understand existing recycling programs, we work with businesses and communities to identify areas for improvement. Our partnerships with municipalities and commercial customers have yielded some of the industry\u2019s greatest diversion successes.As they say, one man\u2019s trash is another man\u2019s treasure.\u00a0 Our team of engineers and sustainability experts are always searching for new uses for recovered resources. We work together with manufacturers to solve for industry-wide challenges.Much of our work in waste processing begins with research. We take a three-pronged approach: our environmental engineering team seeks out emerging technologies throughout the world; we create pilot programs to challenge the status quo and find new answers; and we partner with other entities to research and identify new technologies for advanced materials processing.Are you part of the emerging technology space or want find out about upcoming pilot programs?\u00a0Plastics need to be sorted into \u201clike\u201d plastics before baling, and  is one of the most efficient and remarkable ways to do so. The technology automatically sorts three common types of plastics with an infrared sensor: hard, clear, and colored. The sensor records the size, shape, structure, and position of the plastic on the sort line, and once identified, it hits the plastic with a strong puff of air, sending it into the correct plastics collection bin.Good compost needs added air and water. With a Negative ASP System, organic material sits on perforated pipes in open air, which pulls air down from the compost piles, making it easier to control moisture, oxygen, and microbial levels. The air that is pulled from the compost pile is processed through a bio-filter, which absorbs odors and volatile organic compounds.Check out  to buy compost.\u00a0In 2013, Recology teamed up with  to install a landfill gas-capture system at Recology Hay Road in Vacaville, CA. This system pulls the methane gas generated by the landfill and turns it into electricity to power homes and businesses nearby. The methane gas that\u2019s pumped from the landfill is sent to an energy conversion facility operated by G2 Energy.As a result, the methane captured from the landfill is now providing 1.6 megawatts of electricity \u2013 Enough to power up to 1,600 homes. This is equivalent to taking about 13,000 cars off the road, planting 14,500 acres of forest or otherwise offsetting consumption of approximately 7.6 million gallons of gasoline.After we sort and recover resources from the compost and recycling containers, the next step is finding ideal uses for these materials, or commodities. That means finding manufacturers who commit to using our commodities for the best and highest use \u2013 those who are using our commodities to create further  that will continue the recycling chain.We\u2019re always looking to build relationships with like-minded commodities partners and manufacturers.  to find out more about recovering resources together.Are you a  customer?\u00a0to pay your bill online.Are you an\u00a0 customer?\u00a0to pay your bill online."},

Informa PLC's registered office is 5 Howick Place, London SW1P 1WG. Registered in England and Wales. Number 8860726.Kim A. O'Connell | Apr 01, 2002Few policymakers take the zero waste movement seriously, but California may be helping to change this perception by adopting a zero-waste program as part of its seven-part strategic waste plan.Ratified last November by the California Integrated Waste Management Board (CIWMB), Sacramento, the state's strategic plan notes that the public, industry and government will work to promote a \u201czero-waste California\u201d and \u201cto reduce, reuse or recycle all municipal solid waste materials back into nature or the marketplace in a manner that protects human health and the environment.\u201d This is the first instance nationwide that a zero-waste policy has been adopted by a state.\u201cZero waste gives people the courage to go on and do those other things that weren't part of their original roles as local government and industry leaders,\u201d says Gary Liss, principal of Gary Liss & Associates, Loomis, Calif., state plan consultant. \u201cThe emphasis shifts away from focusing on a landfill problem to focusing on consumption practices in America, and that is what zero waste is about.\u201dThe literal goal of zero waste is to create a waste management infrastructure where everything is recycled, reused or composted, with nothing remaining for disposal. But most zero-waste advocates are realistic, confessing the unlikelihood that all waste can be eliminated, at least in the foreseeable future. Advocates claim that declaring a zero-waste goal is the most effective way to eliminate the maximum amount of waste, with some residual disposal.To achieve its goal, California plans to promote source reduction by reviewing barriers to attaining existing mandates and continuing to educate the public about zero waste; promoting best business practices in product manufacturing and handling, such as working with trade associations to promote beneficial source reduction and related manufacturing opportunities; and promoting new or existing technologies and processes to address existing or emerging waste streams.But more than 30 major industry groups have objected to several terms, such as \u201cextended product responsibility,\u201d in the draft version of California's strategic plan, claiming it would include expensive or infeasible mandates regarding recycling and waste diversion.\u201cVoluntary efforts by business to increase recycling are more cost-effective [than mandates] because they give businesses an opportunity to experiment with different management practices while protecting the environment,\u201d said the Sacramento-based California Chamber of Commerce in response to the plan. \u201cThe Chamber further opposes the use of the [CIWMB] strategic plan as a means to bootstrap into state policy onerous \u2018product stewardship\u2019 requirements that could result in tremendous cost increases to businesses in California.\u201dYet zero waste advocates argue that striving for the goal often means more efficient and cost-effective businesses. \u201cPeople often misconstrue zero waste as being solely a punitive way of dealing with solid waste,\u201d Liss says. \u201cIt's not. Businesses often save money.\u201d By increasing waste diversion, he says, companies can reduce disposal costs and increase operational efficiency.Certainly, the zero-waste concept is not new. The California Resource Recovery Association, Folsom, adopted this goal as part of its Agenda for the New Millennium in 1997. The Grassroots Recycling Network (GRRN), Athens, Ga., has been promoting initiatives throughout the country. And in February 2000, California's Del Norte County Solid Waste Management Authority adopted a zero waste plan, the first such policy in the country.\u201cWhat the zero waste goal does is provide us a clear vision of the direction we want to go in, and that is zero waste or close to it,\u201d says CIWMB board member Mike Paparian. \u201cIn manufacturing, there often is a goal of having zero defects. [Employees] understand that it's the goal to strive for.\u201dCompanies that have achieved more than 90 percent waste diversion include Fetzer Vineyards in Hopland, Calif., which has a goal to reach zero waste by 2009; Mad River Brewery, Blue Lake, Calif., which diverts 98 percent of its garbage from landfills; and the Pillsbury company in Minneapolis, which estimates that it saves more than $500,000 per year in avoided disposal costs because of waste diversion efforts.Other themes in the plan, which will guide the state's waste management activities for the next three to five years, include sustainability, product stewardship, energy recovery, environmental justice, safe waste disposal and increased efficiency in CIWMB activities.CIWMB is planning regular reviews of its strategic plan throughout the next few years to monitor its progress.

Now she's become the founder and CEO of the Simply Co., and her first brick and mortar store, Package Free Shop, which creates household and personal care products free from harmful chemical and wasteful packaging.SEE ALSO: Below she outlines five questions every entrepreneur should be thinking about if they're trying make their business more sustainably focused.\u00a0For the full interview and more discussion, check out the above episode of #BizChats.\"For me, I realized that I really cared about environmental sustainability. It was my entire life. I studied it, I talked about it constantly, but my everyday actions didn't align with that and I think as a business owner, even as an individual, it's important to ask yourself that question, \"what are the values of my business and what does my business believe in?And so for me with The Simply Co., my values are environmental sustainability, not creating waste, and not using toxic chemicals. For my new business Package Free Shop, it's a store for everything you need to live a zero waste lifestyle. Our values are helping individuals decrease their waste through individual power and making it easy, convenient, and accessible for anyone regardless of where you live in the United States to have access to products that help you reduce waste. So, that's the number one thing: Know where your company is, where it stands for, and what it believes in.\"\"I know that's really hard for people sometimes. You know, a lot of entrepreneurs are also creators, and so they want to create things and make things, but there's so much out there that doesn't need to exist and if you're an entrepreneur, you have the capacity to take something and make it into something. If your company doesn't need to exist, if you're causing unnecessary harm, if your product isn't useful and just creates waste, maybe you can use your energy as an entrepreneur to look and see if there are any other problems that have a social or environmental impact that you can use your skills and resources to solve instead of just making something for the sake of making something.\"\u00a0\"This was something I definitely asked myself. The whole point of business, in my opinion, is to solve problems and to provide things that don't already exist. That's the beauty of business and why it can be so powerful and so amazing. For my businesses' with  the problem was we couldn't find sustainable products that were transparent, where I could see all of the ingredients that were in it and I could see the entire supply chain that I could align with the founder.For my company Package Free Shop, I realized there was no easy convenient place to find all the tools I need to live a zero-waste lifestyle and provide education around sustainability. By asking myself those problems, I was able to really quickly decide what kind of a business I wanted to have and what I wanted that business to look like, so I built the business around the problem, not the problem around the business.\"\u00a0\"I think something that people don't think about enough is that every single product that's out there has a backstory that's larger than the product in front of you. So, there might be a piece of clothing in front of you, but that clothing comes from textiles that need to be made in a certain way. Those textiles are grown from crops that are planted and harvested in a certain way. There are people who are growing these things that are being exposed to chemicals if it's a product that isn't organic that are being paid fair or unfair wages, so I always like to emphasize the importance of looking into a supply chain and trying to understand the backstory behind a product.\u00a0You should always know where your products come from and I believe you should always be able to have contact with the founder of a company that you're buying from. It's really important to know  values so what are the values of the companies you're buying from? What do they care about? By buying this product, am I helping to empower a business that's making positive change or negative change?\"\u00a0\"Outside the scope of business, it's looking at your own business and asking: \"Am I creating and fostering an environment where the people that are working for me can grow and take the skills that they're learning and start their own businesses or empower those around them to do positive things?\" \u00a0So for me, with my companies, everyone that works at Package Free Shop, we're teaching everyone how to make their own zero-waste beauty and cleaning products. We're giving them the products that they need to use to learn how to reduce trash in their everyday life and empowering them so they can have the hard skills that they need to go out into the world and kind of infiltrate other businesses and help them to be more sustainable. So they have hard skills they can take away, whether or not they're working for us.\"\u00a0"},
